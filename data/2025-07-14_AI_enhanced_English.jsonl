Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively.
