### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Revisits Soft-argmax in facial landmark detection, proposes structured prediction alternative that achieves SOTA performance with 2.2x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatmap regression methods use Soft-argmax as differentiable approximation for argmax, but this may not be the only effective approach for facial landmark detection.

Method: Proposes an alternative training objective based on classic structured prediction framework instead of using Soft-argmax approximation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, 300W) with 2.2x faster training convergence while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Soft-argmax is not the only way to achieve strong performance in facial landmark detection; structured prediction framework provides an effective alternative with faster convergence.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image classification by leveraging GCNs' ability to model relational data and Voronoi diagrams' spatial representation capabilities, overcoming limitations of conventional CNNs in handling complex data structures.

Method: Represents images as graphs where pixels/regions serve as vertices, refines graphs using Delaunay triangulations, and integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for optimized representation and classification.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios with intricate scenes and fine-grained categories.

Conclusion: The combination of GCNs with Voronoi diagrams provides an effective approach for advancing image classification and expands graph-based learning applications in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO is a single-stage, query-based framework that unifies object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation using only RGB images, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional data like depth or CAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. The authors aim to create a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level without additional data.

Method: YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels.

Result: YOPO sets new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks. On REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under the 10Â°10cm metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: Object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be unified with high performance using only RGB images, demonstrating that complex multi-stage approaches with additional data are not necessary for category-level pose estimation.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks using paired-sampling contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional face recognition systems use separate models for physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries, which increases complexity, latency, and vulnerability to combined attacks.

Method: Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that leverages automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues in a unified training approach.

Result: Achieved an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.10% on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach effectively handles both physical and digital spoofing attacks while being computationally efficient and practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen is a training-free black-box adversarial attack method that uses diffusion models with only 3-20 sampling steps, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining image quality and being 10x faster than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks from generative models produce low-quality images and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models need hundreds of steps for adversarial generation, making them inefficient.

Method: TAIGen injects perturbations during the mixing step interval without processing all timesteps. It uses a selective RGB channel strategy: attention maps on red channel and GradCAM-guided perturbations on green/blue channels to preserve structure while maximizing misclassification.

Result: TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet on ImageNet. Maintains PSNR above 30 dB and generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks.

Conclusion: TAIGen is an efficient and effective adversarial attack method that produces high-quality adversarial images with significantly reduced computational requirements, making it the most impactful attack with the lowest robust accuracy against defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ is a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement that addresses concealed visual perception by combining reversible modeling across mask and RGB domains with a targeted diffusion model for uncertainty refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods are limited to mask domain reversible strategies, leaving RGB domain potential unexplored. The paper aims to develop a more comprehensive approach that handles uncertainty across both domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage deep network that unfolds an optimization solution, integrating three modules: CORE for mask domain reversible modeling, CARE for RGB domain reversible enhancement, and FINE with targeted Bernoulli diffusion for refining uncertain regions only.

Result: RUN++ efficiently directs focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly reducing false positives and negatives while avoiding prohibitive computational costs of full-image diffusion processes.

Conclusion: The approach introduces a new paradigm for robust CVP systems that remain effective under real-world degradations and establishes a broader bi-level optimization framework for concealed visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow introduces curvature-aware flow matching with non-linear trajectories to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image generation, outperforming linear rectified flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rectified flow models use linear trajectories that force generation through low-probability regions, potentially harming semantic alignment between generated images and text captions.

Method: Proposes CurveFlow framework with curvature regularization to learn smooth non-linear trajectories, penalizing abrupt changes in trajectory dynamics.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MS COCO datasets, significantly outperforming standard rectified flow variants and non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion, with notable improvements in semantic consistency metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CLAIR).

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances instructional compliance while maintaining high image quality, demonstrating the importance of non-linear trajectories for faithful text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA is a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework for no-reference image quality assessment that uses hierarchical ranking and quality alignment to predict quality scores from input images alone, without requiring pristine references or auxiliary modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-IQA methods suffer from dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels, limiting their generalization performance. The authors aim to create a framework that can generalize effectively without these dependencies.

Method: Combines ranking and contrastive learning with: 1) novel higher-order ranking loss for relational ordering across distortion pairs, 2) embedding distance loss for feature-perceptual consistency, and 3) training-time contrastive alignment with structured textual prompts. Also introduces HiRQA-S lightweight variant for real-time deployment.

Result: HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations (lens flare, haze, motion blur, low-light) despite being trained only on synthetic distortions. Achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and authentic benchmarks with strong generalization ability and scalability.

Conclusion: HiRQA demonstrates that self-supervised learning with hierarchical ranking and quality alignment can overcome dataset bias issues in NR-IQA, providing effective generalization to real-world distortions without requiring subjective labels or reference images during inference.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments with spatiotemporally correlated disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications in emergency response and tactical scenarios require near-real-time performance in dynamic edge environments, but suffer from reliability issues due to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy using genetic algorithm optimization to solve the camera selection problem, ensuring reliable reconstruction quality despite disruptions.

Result: Demonstrated benefits over traditional baseline strategies using publicly available and customized 3D datasets, showing reliable 3D reconstruction under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: The proposed portfolio-theoretic approach effectively guarantees reconstruction quality satisfaction in dynamic edge environments prone to correlated disruptions, making it suitable for critical applications requiring situational awareness.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Motivation: Address the lack of transparency and interpretability in deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy detection, which hinders clinical adoption despite their promising performance.

Method: Proposes XDR-LVLM framework with Medical Vision Encoder, LVLM Core, Multi-task Prompt Engineering, and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to analyze fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with explanations.

Result: Achieves 84.55% Balanced Accuracy and 79.92% F1 Score for disease diagnosis, with 77.95% BACC and 66.88% F1 for concept detection on DDR dataset. Human evaluations confirm high fluency and clinical utility of explanations.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully bridges the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing both high-precision DR detection and interpretable natural language explanations, enhancing trust and adoption in clinical settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [12] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,RÃ¼diger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeSS is a method that generates high-quality, style-consistent outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric priors, combining image diffusion models with 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved cross-view consistency and geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: City mesh models lack realistic textures, limiting their use in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. Existing image/video diffusion models struggle with 3D scene generation - video models have camera path adherence issues, while image models lack cross-view consistency.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets, 2) Propagate denser intermediate views via AGInpaint component, 3) Globally eliminate visual inconsistencies using GCAlign module. Simultaneously reconstruct 3D Gaussian Splatting scene by initializing Gaussian balls on mesh surface.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Enables diverse style rendering through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Conclusion: MeSS successfully addresses the texture limitation of city mesh models by combining enhanced image diffusion models with 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality, consistent 3D scene generation for urban applications.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

TL;DR: Learning-based method to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents in reinforcement learning, causing failure scenarios in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, it's crucial to properly model rule-based surrounding agents to ensure robust performance against adversarial scenarios.

Method: A learning-based approach is developed to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents, specifically targeting IDM models and other behavior modeling strategies used in current systems.

Result: The adversarial agent was evaluated against all rule-based agents and demonstrated a significant decrease in cumulative reward, indicating successful generation of failure scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based method effectively creates adversarial behaviors that can challenge and expose vulnerabilities in rule-based agent systems, which is valuable for improving robustness in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyMorph-B2I is a dynamic morphology-guided pipeline that converts binary semantic masks to instance-level segmentation for renal pathology, outperforming traditional methods through integrated watershed, skeletonization, and adaptive refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing renal pathology datasets and methods only provide binary semantic masks, limiting precision for downstream morphological analysis. Traditional post-processing techniques individually fail to handle the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity in renal tissue.

Method: Integrated watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework with adaptive geometric refinement and class-specific hyperparameter tuning. Uses systematic parameter optimization to separate adherent and heterogeneous structures.

Result: Outperforms individual classical approaches and naive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I provides an effective solution for converting binary masks to instance segmentation in renal pathology, facilitating precise morphological quantification of renal functional units. The pipeline is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGNet model improves accident prediction from dash-cam videos using enhanced spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks, outperforming previous methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective accident prediction system using only dash-cam video input, which is more challenging but more deployable than sensor-based systems, to improve road safety through timely warnings.

Method: Incorporates better spatio-temporal features and aggregates them through a recurrent network to enhance graph neural networks for accident prediction from dash-cam videos.

Result: STAGNet achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, demonstrating effectiveness both in cross-validation and cross-dataset testing on three publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves state-of-the-art accident prediction from dash-cam videos, offering a more practical and cost-effective solution for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [16] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM is a novel 3D generative model that leverages multiple modalities (RGB, RGBD, point clouds) through collaborative multi-modal coding and triplane latent diffusion to produce high-quality 3D assets with superior textures and geometric details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models either operate in single-modality paradigms, missing complementary benefits of multi-modal data, or are restricted to 3D structures limiting training data scope. The paper aims to holistically harness multi-modalities for better 3D modeling.

Method: 1) Collaborative multi-modal coding that integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique strengths. 2) Auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision for robust multi-modal coding. 3) Triplane latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D assets from embedded multi-modal codes.

Result: Extensive experiments show TriMM achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets despite using small training data. Additional experiments verify feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Conclusion: TriMM successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging multi-modal data for 3D generation, producing superior quality assets with enhanced textures and geometric details through its innovative collaborative multi-modal approach.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework that addresses prototype deviation and inter-class conflicts through soft prototype weighting and dual consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering suffer from prototype deviation (difference between calculated hard prototypes and true cluster centers) and inter-class conflict problems.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Soft prototype contrastive module that uses sample-to-center probability as weights to calculate prototypes, reducing drift and conflicts; 2) Dual consistency learning module that aligns different transformations of same samples and neighborhoods of different samples for transformation invariance and compact intra-cluster distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show the method is effective compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses prototype deviation and inter-class conflict problems in contrastive clustering through soft prototype weighting and dual consistency learning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DuAl-VLN introduces dual-UAV collaborative navigation where high-altitude UAV handles environmental reasoning and low-altitude UAV performs precise navigation, using the HaL-13k dataset and AeroDuo framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV VLN faces challenges with extended trajectories and complex maneuverability, requiring human intervention. The approach leverages UAVs' high mobility for multi-grained perspectives while maintaining manageable motion space.

Method: Proposes dual-UAV collaborative framework (AeroDuo) with high-altitude UAV using multimodal LLM for target reasoning and low-altitude UAV using lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation. Uses HaL-13k dataset with 13,838 collaborative trajectories.

Result: Created comprehensive dataset with unseen maps and objects for systematic generalization evaluation. Framework enables efficient collaboration with minimal coordinate exchange between UAVs.

Conclusion: Dual-altitude UAV collaboration effectively addresses VLN challenges by combining high-level environmental reasoning with precise low-altitude navigation, providing a scalable solution for outdoor UAV navigation.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

### [19] [Pretrained Diffusion Models Are Inherently Skipped-Step Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15233)
*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skipped-step sampling enables faster diffusion model generation by bypassing intermediate denoising steps while maintaining the same training objective, achieving high-quality results with significantly reduced sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require sequential step-by-step generation which is computationally expensive. Existing methods like DDIM use non-Markovian processes, but it's unclear if original diffusion processes can achieve similar efficiency without such modifications.

Method: Proposed skipped-step sampling mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process. This approach is derived from the same training objective as standard diffusion models and can be integrated with DDIM for enhanced performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models (OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, Open Sora) show the method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Conclusion: Accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, providing efficient Markovian generation without requiring non-Markovian processes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

TL;DR: Comp-X is the first LLM-powered interactive image compression system that understands user requests and intelligently selects coding modes, unifying multiple compression objectives into a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs have limited coding modes and require manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for non-professional users who need different compression objectives.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Multi-functional coding framework unifying various coding modes, 2) Interactive coding agent using augmented in-context learning with expert feedback, 3) IIC-bench benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Comp-X efficiently understands coding requests with impressive textual interaction capability while maintaining comparable compression performance with a single framework.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising avenue for AGI in image compression by enabling intelligent, user-friendly compression through LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face

*Han Li,Shaofei Huang,Longfei Xu,Yulu Gao,Beipeng Mu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RATopo introduces a redundancy assignment strategy for lane topology reasoning that enables one-to-many supervision through Transformer decoder restructuring and parallel cross-attention blocks, improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use first-detect-then-reason paradigm with one-to-one assignment, resulting in suboptimal topology reasoning due to limited supervision range and lack of diversity in detected lanes.

Method: Restructures Transformer decoder by swapping cross-attention and self-attention layers to retain redundant lane predictions before suppression, and uses multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters to enhance lane detection diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 show RATopo is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates into existing frameworks, and consistently improves both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.

Conclusion: The redundancy assignment strategy enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision, overcoming limitations of traditional one-to-one assignment approaches in lane topology reasoning.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

TL;DR: DesignCLIP leverages CLIP models for design patent analysis, outperforming baselines in classification and retrieval tasks through class-aware learning and multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patent analysis relies on image data that often lacks comprehensive visual context and semantic information, leading to ambiguities in prior art searches.

Method: Uses CLIP models with class-aware classification, contrastive learning, generated detailed captions for patent images, and multi-view image learning on a large-scale US design patent dataset.

Result: DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models across patent classification, retrieval, and multimodal patent retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches show significant promise for advancing patent analysis, offering more reliable and accurate AI-driven solutions for design patent applications.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA is a novel framework for fetal congenital heart defect classification in ultrasound videos that combines temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification to address image noise and variability in ultrasound imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods for CHD detection in ultrasound videos neglect temporal information, limit to binary classification, and lack prediction calibration, which hinders clinical reliability.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) extracts frame features with an image encoder, aggregates them with a temporal extractor, aligns video representations with class-specific text prompts via contrastive loss, and uses CVAESM module for uncertainty quantification and style modulation.

Result: TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, reduces expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%, and boosts macro F1 by 4.73% on EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task.

Conclusion: TPA effectively addresses key limitations in ultrasound video analysis by integrating temporal modeling, prompt learning, and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating superior performance and improved calibration for clinical applications.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR introduces the first multimodal dataset combining LiDAR and camera data for basketball player tracking, enabling real-time 3D MOT with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to camera-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-camera systems for 3D player tracking face challenges with 2D data limitations, complex 3D reconstruction, and real-time processing difficulties, especially in basketball where rapid movements and frequent occlusions occur.

Method: Created BasketLiDAR dataset with synchronized LiDAR point clouds and multi-view camera footage from professional basketball games. Developed two tracking pipelines: real-time LiDAR-only tracking and multimodal fusion of LiDAR and camera data.

Result: Achieved real-time operation with superior tracking performance under occlusion conditions. Dataset contains 4,445 frames, 3,105 player IDs with complete 3D positional information from 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 professional games.

Conclusion: The multimodal LiDAR-camera approach overcomes limitations of camera-only methods, enabling accurate real-time 3D player tracking in challenging basketball scenarios with frequent occlusions and rapid movements.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

TL;DR: RAG-SEG is a training-free paradigm for camouflaged object detection that uses retrieval-augmented generation to create prompts for SAM segmentation, achieving competitive performance without conventional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camouflaged object detection is challenging due to object-background similarity. Existing methods require heavy training and computational resources, while foundation models like SAM need high-quality prompts that are costly to generate manually.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) creates coarse masks as prompts via unsupervised clustering and feature retrieval, 2) SAM-based segmentation (SEG) refines the masks. Entirely training-free.

Result: Extensive experiments show RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark COD datasets, while running efficiently on a personal laptop.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG provides an effective training-free solution for COD that maintains competitive performance while being computationally efficient and practical for deployment on standard hardware.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns from text-to-video diffusion models that can generate harmful or misleading content using unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials.

Method: Plug-and-play module with two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG), seamlessly integrating with T2V diffusion models without requiring training.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across four tasks (object, artistic style, celebrity, and explicit content erasure), achieving 46% average reduction in undesirable content generation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VideoEraser provides an effective, robust, and generalizable solution for preventing T2V models from generating harmful content while maintaining content integrity and fidelity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and

training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need to predict pedestrian intentions from a distance to ensure safety, requiring systems that can detect if a person is about to cross the road.

Method: Used deep learning models for pose detection combined with sequence modeling techniques (GRU, LSTM, 1D CNN) for temporal predictions in an end-to-end framework analyzing video data.

Result: GRU performed better than LSTM for intent prediction accuracy, while 1D CNN was the fastest model in terms of processing speed.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed an integrated deep learning framework for pedestrian intent prediction, with different sequence models offering trade-offs between accuracy and speed for autonomous vehicle applications.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

### [30] [An Empirical Study on How Video-LLMs Answer Video Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15360)
*Chenhui Gou,Ziyu Ma,Zicheng Duan,Haoyu He,Feng Chen,Akide Liu,Bohan Zhuang,Jianfei Cai,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic empirical study using attention knockouts to understand how Video-LLMs internally process video content, revealing key insights about layer functionality and enabling computational efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Video-LLM research focuses on performance improvement rather than understanding internal mechanisms, creating a gap in interpretability that this study aims to address.

Method: The authors use attention knockouts as the primary analytical tool with three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. They apply these knockouts across different layer windows in both global and fine-grained settings to analyze model behavior.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Video information extraction occurs primarily in early layers with a two-stage process; (2) Certain intermediate layers have outsized impact while most contribute minimally; (3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than expensive self-attention among video tokens.

Conclusion: The study provides the first systematic understanding of Video-LLM internal processing, offering both interpretability insights and practical efficiency improvements through reduced attention computation, with implications for future research.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune is an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes specific layers instead of all parameters, reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning updates all model parameters, which can lead to overfitting and high computational costs. There's a need for more efficient transfer learning methods that maintain performance while reducing resource requirements.

Method: BioTune uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify and selectively fine-tune only the most relevant layers for a given target task, rather than updating all model parameters.

Result: Evaluation across nine image classification datasets shows BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like AutoRGN and LoRA, while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: By focusing fine-tuning on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune enables more efficient transfer learning with reduced computational costs while maintaining performance across diverse datasets and distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer is a novel compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves kilobyte-range compression while enabling post-archival scene updates through image-conditioned decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods only achieve megabyte-range compression and lack mechanisms for handling scene changes after long-term archival, making them impractical for large-scale scenes or archival use.

Method: Proposes Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer that jointly exploits inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations, uses shared codebooks across scenes, and enables conditional decoding based on images captured at decoding time for scene adaptability.

Result: ICGS-Quantizer reduces 3DGS storage requirements to kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for 3DGS archival by achieving substantial compression and enabling post-archival scene updates, making it suitable for large-scale scenes and long-term storage applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

*Cong Wang,Xianda Guo,Wenbo Xu,Wei Tian,Ruiqi Song,Chenming Zhang,Lingxi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat is a 3D scene reconstruction method for driving scenarios that uses neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization, and deformable neural Gaussians to handle motion blur and improve novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for driving scenarios overlook background optimization with proper geometry relationships and rely too heavily on fitting individual training views, resulting in limited robustness for novel views and inaccurate geometric representations.

Method: Uses neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization (near/middle/far regions), deformable neural Gaussians for non-rigid dynamic actors with learnable deformation network, and supervision from depth and normal priors from pre-trained models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo and KITTI datasets for novel-view synthesis in driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveSplat effectively addresses motion blur and geometric accuracy challenges in driving scenario reconstruction through its innovative dynamic-static decoupling approach and geometric supervision.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

*Ruizhuo Song,Beiming Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the abstract reasoning limitations of deep learning models using Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) as a benchmark. It proposes causal chain modeling for RPM tasks and identifies limitations in mutual information optimization, leading to three improvement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with abstract reasoning despite strong performance in other domains. RPM problems serve as an authoritative benchmark to evaluate and enhance abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving capabilities in machine intelligence.

Method: The paper adopts a "causal chain modeling" perspective to analyze RPM tasks: image â abstract attributes â progressive attribute patterns â pattern consistency â correct answer. It designs the DIO baseline model but finds mutual information maximization insufficient, leading to three progressive improvement methods.

Result: Experiments reveal that the baseline DIO model's optimization objective (maximizing variational lower bound of mutual information between context and correct option) fails to enable genuine acquisition of human reasoning logic due to lower bound tightness issues and mutual information's inability to capture causal relationships.

Conclusion: The paper identifies fundamental limitations in using mutual information for abstract reasoning tasks and proposes three improvement methods to overcome these limitations, aiming to better capture causal relationships and human reasoning logic in RPM problem-solving.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global temporal dependencies, maintaining semantic coherence, and handling noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: Proposes Spiking Variational Graph Network with: 1) SNN-based keyframe extractor for event-driven computation, 2) Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for fine-grained reasoning, and 3) Variational Inference Reconstruction Module with ELBO optimization to handle feature fusion noise.

Result: SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets including SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Conclusion: The proposed SpiVG Network effectively addresses challenges in video summarization by combining spiking neural networks, graph reasoning, and variational inference, achieving superior performance while enhancing information density and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn spatial correlations in images, showing that masking ratio and patch size control whether features capture short- or long-range correlations, and provides practical guidance for hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAEs require extensive hyperparameter tuning for new datasets, but the connection between these hyperparameters and downstream performance remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how they affect learning of spatial correlations.

Method: The authors analytically derive features learned by linear MAEs and extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to understand how representations adapt to spatial correlations beyond second-order statistics.

Result: The research shows that masking ratio and patch size can selectively capture short- and long-range spatial correlations, and that MAE representations adapt to dataset-specific spatial correlation patterns.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical insights into MAE behavior and practical guidance for hyperparameter selection based on the spatial correlation properties of target datasets.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIRD is a bidirectional temporal propagation method for infrared small target detection that simultaneously utilizes local and global temporal information through forward/backward propagation with LTMF and GTMF modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sliding-window methods for infrared small target detection ignore global temporal information outside the window and lack joint optimization of entire video clips, leading to redundant computation and sub-optimal performance.

Method: Proposes BIRD with bidirectional propagation strategy: LTMF module models local spatio-temporal dependency between target frame and adjacent frames, GTMF module aggregates global propagation feature with local fusion feature, and uses detection loss plus Spatio-Temporal Fusion loss for joint optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed.

Conclusion: BIRD effectively addresses limitations of sliding-window methods by leveraging both local and global temporal information through bidirectional propagation, achieving superior detection performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional car damage inspection is manual, time-consuming, and unreliable for detecting tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents, creating a need for automated, accurate detection methods.

Method: Used YOLOv8 object recognition framework with custom variants (YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42) trained on a bespoke dataset of annotated car surface images under various conditions, employing real-time data augmentation for robustness.

Result: YOLOv8m-t42 model achieved precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, F1-score of 0.85, mAP@0.5 of 0.60, and PR curve area of 0.88, outperforming the YOLOv8m-t4 variant and demonstrating excellent detection accuracy with low inference latency.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based approach using customized YOLOv8 models provides an effective solution for real-time microscopic dent detection on car surfaces, making it suitable for practical applications like automated insurance assessments and vehicle inspections.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR is a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval that uses dual-stage sequence alignment and self-supervised pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet-VRL and SportsMoments datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-to-video moment retrieval requires semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos, which existing methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: MATR uses transformer architecture with dual-stage sequence alignment to condition target video representations on query features, followed by foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads. Includes self-supervised pre-training by localizing random clips within videos.

Result: Achieves 13.1% improvement in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on ActivityNet-VRL, and 14.7% gain in R@1 and 14.4% gain in mIoU on SportsMoments dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MATR effectively addresses the challenges of video-to-video moment retrieval through its transformer-based architecture and self-supervised pre-training, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse views (as few as 2 views), achieving state-of-the-art performance with 2.75dB PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires dense multi-view inputs with precise camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. SfM initialization fails with extremely sparse views, leading to degraded rendering quality.

Method: Proposes dense stereo module for camera pose estimation and global dense point cloud initialization, coherent view interpolation for additional supervision, multi-scale Laplacian regularization, and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms other 3DGS-based approaches with 2.75dB PSNR improvement using only 2 training views. Synthesized images show minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS in sparse-view scenarios by eliminating SfM dependency and introducing novel regularization techniques, achieving superior visual quality and geometric accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of

exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet is a lightweight medical image segmentation framework that uses heterogeneous kernels and sparse transformer-convolutional hybrids to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for lightweight yet high-performance medical image segmentation models in resource-constrained clinical settings, overcoming limitations of existing lightweight models that sacrifice performance for efficiency and lack global contextual perception capabilities.

Method: Proposes LGMSNet with heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while reducing channel redundancy, and integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information.

Result: Extensive experiments across six public datasets show LGMSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: LGMSNet demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios, offering a lightweight yet highly effective solution for medical image segmentation with excellent generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction of clothed human avatars from sparse multi-view images by leveraging multiple viewpoints for better geometry and pose estimation, building upon the limitations of single-view methods.

Method: Proposes Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm that fits a single SMPL-X body model across all input views with multi-view consistency. Uses optimized body model as low-frequency prior, then adds geometric details via normal map integration from front and back views.

Result: Consistently improves fidelity over single-view baseline and achieves competitive performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods, accurately capturing fine details like clothing folds and hairstyles.

Conclusion: MExECON successfully extends single-view reconstruction to multi-view scenarios without network retraining, demonstrating effective use of multi-view consistency and normal map integration for high-quality 3D human avatar reconstruction.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse is a novel multimodal image fusion framework that uses adaptive wavelet transform and spatial-frequency mamba blocks to address modality misalignment and detail preservation across multiple fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods face challenges with modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations. There's a need for a generalized approach that can handle diverse multimodal fusion tasks while preserving critical details.

Method: Proposes AdaSFFuse with two key innovations: Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains. Uses learnable mappings for dynamic adjustment across modalities.

Result: Superior fusion performance demonstrated across four MMIF tasks: Infrared-Visible, Multi-Focus, Multi-Exposure, and Medical Image Fusion. Achieves low computational cost with compact network architecture, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse effectively addresses MMIF challenges through adaptive frequency separation and cross-domain fusion, providing a robust and efficient solution for multiple image fusion applications with publicly available code.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: ExtraGS is a novel framework for synthesizing extrapolated driving scene views that combines geometric and generative priors using Road Surface Gaussians and Far Field Gaussians with self-supervised uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for synthesizing extrapolated driving views suffer from poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings when using generative priors as pseudo ground truth.

Method: Proposes ExtraGS with Road Surface Gaussian (RSG) representation using hybrid Gaussian-SDF design, Far Field Gaussians (FFG) with learnable scaling factors, and self-supervised uncertainty estimation via spherical harmonics for selective generative prior integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ExtraGS significantly enhances realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views while maintaining high fidelity along original trajectories across multiple datasets and camera setups.

Conclusion: ExtraGS provides a holistic solution for trajectory extrapolation that effectively integrates geometric and generative priors, addressing key limitations in driving scene synthesis for autonomous vehicle simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch animation methods struggle with multi-object interactions and complex motions, being limited to single-object cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Motion Initialization - interactive semantic grouping and key frame definition with interpolation, 2) Motion Refinement - Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) with Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE) that refines animation using text-to-video model priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show GroupSketch significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex multi-object sketches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions, expanding practical applications of sketch animation with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet is a novel network for extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery, using dilated dual-stream differential attention fusion to address challenges of limited width, fragmentation, and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow roads in remote sensing imagery are difficult to extract due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and frequent occlusions. Conventional models often overfit to generic road widths and struggle with fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road segments.

Method: D3FNet introduces three key innovations: 1) Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module for enhancing subtle road features and suppressing background noise, 2) Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) integrating original and attention-modulated features, and 3) multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9) to mitigate gridding artifacts and improve continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies confirm the complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.

Conclusion: D3FNet is a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios, effectively addressing the specific challenges of narrow road segmentation.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT is a backpropagation-free test-time adaptation method that models class-conditional distributions using Gaussian inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance without source data or gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods rely on backpropagation/iterative optimization which limits scalability and real-time deployment, and lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions needed for reliable decision boundaries.

Method: Reframes TTA as Gaussian probabilistic inference using gradually updated class means and shared covariance matrix. Uses CLIP priors and historical knowledge bank for regularization. Requires no source data, gradient updates, or full target data access.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks under various distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: ADAPT provides an effective backpropagation-free solution for test-time adaptation that enables reliable distribution shift handling with excellent scalability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage training strategy using neighbor-aware soft mask to address spectral bias in Implicit Neural Representations, improving high-frequency detail capture without architectural changes


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome spectral bias in INRs that favors low-frequency components and struggles with high-frequency details like sharp edges and fine textures

Method: Two-stage training: 1) neighbor-aware soft mask assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations to focus on fine details early, 2) transition to full-image training

Result: Consistently improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods

Conclusion: Pioneering approach to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels, offering new avenue for mitigating spectral bias problem in image INRs

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel linear time convex relaxation and contractor method for fast global optimal point cloud registration with high outlier robustness, achieving two orders of magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art SDP methods for rotation-only problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TLS-based point cloud registration methods can handle up to 95% outliers but are computationally expensive, with SDP relaxations taking hundreds of seconds for 100 points, creating a need for faster globally optimal solvers.

Method: Proposed a linear time convex relaxation combined with a contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound (BnB) optimization for solving the truncated least squares registration problem.

Result: The solver achieves provable global optimality in under 0.5 seconds for 100-point 3D registration when rotation axis is known, demonstrating two orders of magnitude speed improvement over STRIDE SDP solver for rotation-only TLS problems.

Conclusion: The method provides a significant computational breakthrough for globally optimal point cloud registration with high outlier robustness, though currently limited to problems with known rotation axis rather than full 6DoF estimation.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT is a Video LLM that enhances temporal perception through diffusion-based encoding, object grounding, and explicit timestamp modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal perception - they implicitly encode timestamps, have weak frame-level continuity features, and suffer from language-vision alignment drift with entities of interest.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder for boundary sensitivity and temporal consistency, 2) Object grounded representations that bind query entities to visual evidence, 3) Mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens for explicit timestamp modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating robust grounding capabilities.

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT successfully overcomes limitations in temporal perception for Video LLMs through its three-component design, enabling fine-grained temporal reasoning and improved entity alignment.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Weakly supervised approach for tree instance segmentation in ALS data using human quality ratings to train a rating model that improves segmentation performance by 34%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree instance segmentation from ALS data is challenging due to data variations and expensive precise labeling requirements for fully supervised methods

Method: Human operators provide quality ratings on initial segmentation results, which train a rating model that classifies segmentation outputs, then the segmentation model is finetuned using this feedback

Result: 34% improvement in correctly identified tree instances with reduced false positives, though performance decreases in sparse forests with small trees (<2m) and complex environments with shrubs/boulders

Conclusion: Weak supervision through human quality ratings effectively improves tree segmentation while reducing labeling costs, though challenges remain in complex terrain with small vegetation

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFG is a transfer-based black-box attack method for 3D point clouds that improves adversarial transferability by prioritizing corruption of critical features shared across different DNN architectures, while maintaining imperceptibility through constrained deviation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D adversarial attack methods require access to target model information, which is unrealistic in secure scenarios. The paper addresses the need for effective transfer-based attacks that work without any target model information.

Method: Proposes Critical Feature Guidance (CFG) that regularizes adversarial search by computing feature importance, prioritizing corruption of critical features likely used by diverse architectures. Also constrains maximum deviation in loss function for imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show CFG outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin in transferability.

Conclusion: CFG demonstrates that focusing on critical features shared across architectures enables effective transfer-based black-box attacks on 3D point clouds without requiring target model information.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

*Franz Hanke,Antonia Bieringer,Olaf Wysocki,Boris Jutzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CM2LoD3 is a novel method for automated LoD3 building model reconstruction using Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis and synthetic data generation to segment facade elements like windows and doors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoD1 and LoD2 building models lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban analysis, while traditional LoD3 generation requires manual modeling that is not scalable for large applications.

Method: Leverages Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis, uses Semantic Conflict Map Generator to create synthetic CMs for semantic segmentation, and fuses textured model segmentation with CMs using confidence scores.

Result: Achieves 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures, effectively segmenting and reconstructing building openings.

Conclusion: The method advances automated LoD3 model reconstruction, enabling scalable and efficient 3D city modeling for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDPR framework addresses class imbalance in VLM fine-tuning by creating multi-dimensional knowledge base and dynamic prompt routing for balanced predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fine-tuning methods overlook inherent class imbalance from pre-training, leading to bias accumulation in downstream tasks, especially with LLM-enhanced approaches.

Method: Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) constructs comprehensive visual-semantic knowledge base across 5 dimensions, uses dynamic routing to align classes, retrieve optimal prompts, and balance fine-grained semantics with logits fusion.

Result: Achieves comparable results with SOTA methods on long-tailed benchmarks (CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT), with minimal computational overhead and effective semantic library for tail classes.

Conclusion: MDPR provides flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance through multi-dimensional knowledge representation and dynamic routing mechanism.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

*Yanlai Yang,Zhuokai Zhao,Satya Narayan Shukla,Aashu Singh,Shlok Kumar Mishra,Lizhu Zhang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamMem enables efficient long video understanding by compressing KV cache in a streaming manner without requiring pre-encoding or advance question knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to high memory/computational overhead from KV cache storage. Existing methods require full context encoding or advance question knowledge, which is impractical for streaming video and multi-turn conversations.

Method: Proposes StreamMem - a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism that encodes new video frames in streaming fashion, compresses KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining fixed-size KV memory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware approaches on three long video understanding and two streaming video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: StreamMem provides an efficient solution for memory-constrained long-video scenarios by enabling streaming video understanding without requiring pre-encoding or advance question knowledge.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

*Zhiheng Liu,Xueqing Deng,Shoufa Chen,Angtian Wang,Qiushan Guo,Mingfei Han,Zeyue Xue,Mengzhao Chen,Ping Luo,Linjie Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWeaver is a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions (like depth cues) to improve temporal consistency and reduce structural drift in extended video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods rely heavily on RGB signals, which leads to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over long durations. There's a need for better temporal consistency and structural preservation in long-horizon video generation.

Method: The framework jointly predicts perceptual conditions and color information from unified representation, leverages depth cues (more resistant to drift) to build a memory bank for clearer context, and uses segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups to reduce computational costs.

Result: Extensive experiments on diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate WorldWeaver effectively reduces temporal drift and improves fidelity of generated videos in long sequences.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver provides a robust solution for long video generation by combining RGB and perceptual condition modeling, depth-based memory preservation, and efficient training techniques to achieve superior temporal consistency and structural integrity.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: All-in-SAM model combines molecular-empowered learning with SAM adapter to improve nuclei segmentation accuracy while reducing annotation workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM enable nuclei segmentation but struggle with fine-grained semantic segmentation of specific cell subtypes. Current approaches require extensive pixel-level annotations which are resource-intensive.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) molecular-empowered learning to engage lay annotators and reduce detailed annotations, (2) SAM adapter to adapt SAM for specific semantics while maintaining generalizability, (3) Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL) to refine segmentation accuracy.

Result: Significant improvement in cell classification performance across both in-house and public datasets, even with varying annotation quality.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotator workload and extends precise biomedical image analysis accessibility to resource-limited settings, advancing medical diagnostics and pathology automation.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for high-quality image and video generation that addresses the need for better motion capture, temporal consistency, and modality alignment in a single model.

Method: Uses Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for enhanced modality alignment and faster training convergence, with comprehensive data curation pipeline and MLLM-based video quality filtering for training data quality.

Result: Generates 5-10 second videos at 720p native resolution (upscaled to 1080p), achieves superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency, ranks Top 3 on T2V and I2V leaderboards, outperforms open-source models and matches commercial solutions.

Conclusion: Waver represents a significant advancement in unified image and video generation, providing detailed training recipes to help the community efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in the field.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLAS is a high-fidelity parametric body model that decouples shape and skeleton representation, enabling more accurate 3D human modeling with enhanced expressivity and control over body attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mesh models struggle with detailed variations across diverse poses and shapes due to limited training data diversity and problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and external soft tissue.

Method: Learned from 600k high-resolution scans using 240 synchronized cameras, ATLAS explicitly decouples shape and skeleton bases by grounding mesh representation in the human skeleton, using non-linear pose correctives.

Result: ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, with quantitative evaluations showing non-linear pose correctives capture complex poses better than linear models.

Conclusion: The skeleton-shape decoupling approach enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent of soft-tissue characteristics, representing a significant advancement in parametric body modeling.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: Uses a novel feature aggregation module integrating local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders, coupled with a position head to generate 3D assets and their spatial positions in one feedforward pass.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm efficiency and robust generation abilities, with direct extensibility to multi-image inputs despite single-image training.

Conclusion: SceneGen offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation that can advance practical applications in downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit is a visual autoregressive framework that reframes image editing as next-scale prediction, using scale-aligned conditioning to outperform diffusion models in adherence and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from global denoising that causes unintended modifications and poor adherence to editing instructions, while autoregressive models offer better compositional control.

Method: VAREdit uses a visual autoregressive framework with Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module to inject scale-matched source image conditioning for next-scale prediction of target features.

Result: Outperforms leading diffusion methods by 30%+ higher GPT-Balance score, completes 512x512 editing in 1.2 seconds (2.2x faster than UltraEdit).

Conclusion: Autoregressive approach with scale-aligned conditioning provides superior editing adherence and efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable group inference method that improves diversity and quality of multiple samples by formulating selection as a quadratic integer assignment problem with progressive candidate pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent sampling in generative models leads to redundant results when presenting multiple outputs to users, limiting choices and hindering idea exploration.

Method: Formulates group inference as quadratic integer assignment problem (candidate outputs as graph nodes), optimizing quality (unary term) and diversity (binary term) with progressive candidate pruning for scalability.

Result: Significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms across text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Enables generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples, providing better user experience for multi-sample applications.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

TL;DR: CineScale is a novel inference paradigm that enables high-resolution visual generation (up to 8k images and 4k videos) without fine-tuning, addressing repetitive pattern issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual diffusion models are limited to low-resolution training due to data and computation constraints, and existing tuning-free methods produce low-quality content with repetitive patterns when generating higher-resolution visuals.

Method: Proposes CineScale, a novel inference paradigm with dedicated variants tailored to different video generation architectures, enabling high-resolution T2I, T2V, I2V and V2V synthesis without fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in higher-resolution visual generation, enabling 8k image generation without fine-tuning and 4k video generation with minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CineScale successfully extends the capabilities of pre-trained models for high-resolution visual generation, overcoming the limitations of existing methods and enabling unprecedented resolution scaling.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

TL;DR: First open-source surgical wound dataset (SurgWound) with 697 images and 8 clinical attributes, plus a three-stage MLLM framework (WoundQwen) for automated surgical wound diagnosis and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of public datasets and benchmarks for surgical wound screening, overcoming data privacy concerns and high annotation costs that hinder deep learning progress in surgical site infection prevention.

Method: Three-stage learning framework: 1) Five MLLMs predict specific wound characteristics, 2) Two MLLMs use these predictions to diagnose infection risk and intervention needs, 3) Final MLLM integrates results to generate comprehensive reports.

Result: Created SurgWound dataset with 697 professionally annotated surgical wound images and established first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis including VQA and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enables automated analysis of surgical wound characteristics and provides personalized care instructions, paving the way for improved patient outcomes through timely intervention and personalized wound care.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.
