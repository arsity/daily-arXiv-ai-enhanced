Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides\na promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nbenchmark of generative models$\\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)\ntechniques$\\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation.

Our quantitative and\nqualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms\ndiffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,\nand computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these\nresults suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small\ndatasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN\nperformance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I\ntranslation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising\ndirections for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images.

By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.
