*Yuqi Li,Chuanguang Yang,Junhao Dong,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Zeyu Dong,Hansheng Zeng,Zhulin An,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD is a knowledge distillation framework that creates lightweight image-text retrieval models by combining multi-modal feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to reduce model size while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLP models have high computational complexity and large sizes that limit deployment on mobile devices, creating a need for lightweight yet effective retrieval models.

Method: Uses feature fusion network for multi-modal feature extraction, multi-teacher distillation with two CLIP teachers, KL scatter for probability matching, and adaptive dynamic weighting to optimize teacher influence.

Result: Achieves superior performance on three benchmark datasets while significantly reducing model complexity compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AMMKD provides an effective and flexible solution for deploying lightweight image-text retrieval models on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Motivation: Address high carbon emissions from deep learning training by creating quantitative metrics that integrate energy efficiency and accuracy, moving beyond traditional performance-only evaluation.

Method: Developed two novel metrics: Sustainable Harmonic Mean (FMS) that combines accumulated energy consumption and performance via harmonic mean, and Area Under Sustainability Curve (ASC) that constructs performance-power consumption curves. Tested across image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch/online learning tasks.

Result: The evaluation system successfully provides quantitative basis for cross-task algorithm assessment and facilitates the transition of green AI research from theory to practice. The framework code is made available for industry adoption.

Conclusion: The proposed sustainability evaluation system offers a practical approach to measure and compare algorithm energy efficiency, supporting the establishment of industry standards for green AI and promoting environmentally conscious deep learning practices.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional input modalities like Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image fail to adequately capture subtle and fleeting micro-expressions, leading to suboptimal performance in micro-expression recognition.

Method: Introduces MESTI to transform video sequences into single images preserving micro-movement characteristics, and MEGANet with Gradient Attention block for enhanced fine-grained motion feature extraction. Evaluated across multiple CNN architectures and compared with existing methods.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CASMEII and SAMM datasets. MESTI consistently improves performance when replacing inputs of existing MER networks. MEGANet with MESTI combination achieves highest reported accuracy.

Conclusion: MESTI is a superior input modality and MEGANet is an advanced recognition network, setting new benchmarks for micro-expression recognition and enabling more effective MER systems for various applications.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion is a discrete diffusion language model that generates realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures by treating voxels as tokens, overcoming challenges of cubic memory scaling and class imbalance in sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and significant class imbalance caused by sparsity.

Method: Treats voxels as tokens and uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures, extending discrete diffusion beyond sequential domains to spatially coherent 3D structures.

Result: Demonstrates realistic and coherent structure generation on Minecraft house structures from 3D-Craft dataset, outperforming prior baselines and auto-regressive formulations even with over 98% sparsity.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion shows promise as a framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling, enabling generation of spatially coherent structures despite extreme sparsity conditions.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGLC framework combines global and local features for high-resolution image dehazing, improving PSNR and visual fidelity in large-scale imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dehazing models struggle with high-resolution images, often requiring downsampling or patching that degrades performance due to difficulty in combining global context with local details.

Method: Proposes SGLC framework with two components: Global Features Generator (GFG) for broad contextual understanding and Local Features Enhancer (LFE) for refining localized details. Integrated with Uformer architecture and designed to be model-agnostic.

Result: Experimental results show considerable improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on high-resolution datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing haze in large-scale imagery.

Conclusion: SGLC enables robust dehazing for high-resolution inputs by effectively combining global scene-level cues with granular local details, significantly improving visual fidelity while maintaining model-agnostic flexibility.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First large-scale self-supervised model for kidney abnormality detection in drug safety studies, showing UNI foundation model features alone are insufficient but self-supervised learning achieves better-than-chance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kidney abnormality detection in preclinical drug development requires examining thousands of whole-slide images, which is time-consuming and costly. Most slides are normal, making it inefficient to manually review all.

Method: Used UNI foundation model features and tested a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier (performed at chance level). Then applied self-supervised learning method to the same features for abnormality detection.

Result: Self-supervised method achieved AUC of 0.62 and negative predictive value of 89%, demonstrating better-than-chance performance for detecting abnormalities.

Conclusion: With further development, such self-supervised models can help rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment, reducing costs and time in drug development pipelines.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well on standard images, their capabilities in cluttered datasets with complex environments and deformed objects remain unexplored.

Method: Introduces a specialized waste classification dataset and presents an in-depth evaluation approach to assess VLLM robustness and accuracy.

Result: The evaluation reveals limitations in current VLLMs' performance in challenging conditions with complex environments and deformed objects.

Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the critical need for further advancements in VLLM robustness to handle complex real-world scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

### [10] [Category-level Text-to-Image Retrieval Improved: Bridging the Domain Gap with Diffusion Models and Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00177)
*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-step approach for text-to-image retrieval that bridges the modality gap by generating visual queries from text using diffusion models, then combining image-to-image similarity with text-based retrieval for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-and-language models like CLIP map text and images to distant regions in representation space, limiting retrieval performance for category-specific queries due to the modality gap between text and visual representations.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Transform text query into visual query using generative diffusion model, 2) Estimate image-to-image similarity with vision model. Includes aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both text and visual modalities.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the approach consistently outperforms retrieval methods that rely solely on text queries, demonstrating improved performance in text-to-image retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the modality gap by leveraging advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models, providing superior retrieval performance for semantic category queries compared to text-only approaches.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM benchmark and Safe-LLaVA dataset address biometric privacy leakage in MLLMs by providing evaluation metrics and privacy-preserving training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes without explicit requests, raising privacy concerns in real-world applications.

Method: Introduces PRISM benchmark to evaluate biometric leakage and refusal capabilities, and creates Safe-LLaVA dataset by removing biometric information from LLaVA data.

Result: Evaluation reveals widespread biometric leakage across MLLMs, and fine-tuning on Safe-LLaVA significantly reduces privacy violations.

Conclusion: PRISM and Safe-LLaVA establish new standards for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME is a cross-modal alignment method that enhances vision-language models for embodied tasks by learning ego-centric world models with spatio-temporal cues, improving navigation and reasoning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation capabilities for dynamic, open-set embodied tasks like navigation and question answering, due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension.

Method: Proposes VEME framework with three components: 1) cross-modal alignment bridging objects, spatial representations and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues, 2) dynamic implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding for task-relevant memory recall, 3) instruction-based navigation framework using embodied priors for long-term planning.

Result: Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE show 1%-3% improvement in accuracy and exploration efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments by embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, enhancing generalization in unseen scenes.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

*Farhan Fuad Abir,Abigail Elliott Daly,Kyle Anderman,Tolga Ozmen,Laura J. Brattain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning combining ultrasound images and clinical data improves classification of rare phyllodes tumors, outperforming single-modality approaches and potentially reducing unnecessary surgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phyllodes tumors are difficult to distinguish from benign fibroadenomas preoperatively using standard methods, leading to unnecessary surgical excisions that could be avoided with better diagnostic tools.

Method: Developed a dual-branch neural network that integrates breast ultrasound images with structured clinical data from 81 subjects, using class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation to handle class imbalance and prevent data leakage.

Result: The multimodal approach outperformed unimodal baselines, with ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieving the best performance (AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294 respectively) in classifying benign vs borderline/malignant tumors.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI shows strong potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for phyllodes tumors, which could reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FHT2SP algorithm combines fast computation with high accuracy for Hough Transform, achieving near-optimal complexity while maintaining constant-bounded error independent of image size.


<details>

Motivation: Existing fast Hough Transform algorithms either have optimal complexity but reduced accuracy that worsens with scale, or have high accuracy but require near-cubic computational cost. There's a need for an algorithm that achieves both speed and accuracy.

Method: Builds on Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes beyond power-of-two constraints, and integrates it into the FHT2DT algorithm. Uses appropriate superpixel size selection to balance complexity and accuracy.

Result: Achieves near-optimal computational complexity O(wh ln³ w) while keeping approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size. Error is controllable via a meta-parameter.

Conclusion: FHT2SP provides a practical solution that bridges the gap between fast but inaccurate and accurate but slow Hough Transform algorithms, offering both computational efficiency and high precision.

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

*Liang Gong,Tommy,Wang,Sara Chaker,Yanchen Dong,Fouad Bousetouane,Brenden Morton,Mark Mendez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in manufacturing that achieves CAD-level precision through three stages: data preprocessing, conditional GAN contour generation, and VLM-based refinement with standardized prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial computer vision systems struggle with noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines.

Method: Three-stage system: 1) Data acquisition and preprocessing, 2) Contour generation using conditional GAN, 3) Multimodal contour refinement through vision-language modeling with standardized prompts in human-in-the-loop process.

Result: Improved contour fidelity on proprietary FabTrack datasets, enhancing edge continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. GPT-image-1 outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in structural accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: VLM-guided generative workflows show promise for advancing industrial computer vision beyond classical pipeline limitations, achieving CAD-level precision in manufacturing applications.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

*Ghassen Baklouti,Maxime Zanella,Ismail Ben Ayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIMO introduces a novel information-theoretic loss function and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for transductive few-shot learning with CLIP, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transductive few-shot learning has been extensively studied for vision-only models but remains underdeveloped for vision-language models (VLMs), with only a few recent methods exploring this area and highlighting the need for VLM-specific approaches.

Method: Proposes Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss with three components: mutual information between vision inputs and textual class descriptions, KL divergence penalty from text-driven zero-shot predictions, and standard cross-entropy loss. Also explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies.

Result: LIMO outperforms recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods, with substantial performance boosts from PEFT strategies.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the effectiveness of information-theoretic approaches and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for transductive few-shot learning in vision-language models, showing that adapting a subset of model parameters can lead to substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

### [18] [MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311)
*Hikmat Khan,Syed Farhan Alam Zaidi,Pir Masoom Shah,Kiruthika Balakrishnan,Rabia Khan,Muhammad Waqas,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen is a domain generalization method for histopathology that uses nuclear morphology and spatial organization features through contrastive learning with nuclear masks to create robust cancer representations resilient to domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues like nuclear atypia and spatial organization that remain diagnostic across different institutions, unlike current ML systems that struggle with heterogeneity in whole slide images caused by variations in tissue preparation and staining.

Method: MorphGen integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks in a supervised contrastive learning framework, aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks to prioritize diagnostic features over domain-specific artifacts, with additional stochastic weight averaging for flatter minima.

Result: Attention map analyses show MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization for classification. The method demonstrates resilience to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, showing strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: MorphGen successfully addresses domain generalization challenges in computational histopathology by learning biologically robust representations based on nuclear morphology and spatial organization, making deep learning systems more resilient to domain shifts and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

### [19] [Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual token pruning method for Large Multimodal Models that reduces computational costs by 88.9% token reduction while maintaining performance through mutual information-based pruning and diversity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models suffer from high computational and memory costs due to increased token counts during inference. Existing token pruning methods are either costly or use suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens.

Method: Proposes visual-only token pruning with two strategies: 1) mutual information-based pruning to remove visual tokens semantically misaligned with text, preserving cross-modal alignment; 2) maximizing expected pairwise distances in embedding space to prune redundant tokens and maintain intra-modal diversity using a greedy algorithm.

Result: Achieves 88.9% token reduction on models like LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B while maintaining strong performance, resulting in 56.7% improvement in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed visual token pruning strategy effectively reduces computational overhead while preserving both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity, making Large Multimodal Models more efficient without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition

extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support

multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrared and visible image fusion research focuses on performance improvement but neglects real-time applicability on mobile devices. There's a need for efficient fusion methods that work well on low-power devices.

Method: Proposes a look-up table structure with low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding. Uses efficient LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization methods, integrating multi-modal fusion network performance into MM-LUT model.

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse provides an extremely fast and efficient solution for infrared and visible image fusion, making real-time fusion practical on mobile devices while maintaining high performance standards.

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

*Marzi Heidari,Yuhong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TO-SDG leverages target domain textual descriptions without target data to improve single domain generalization. STAR module injects target semantics into source features using CLIP's text embeddings and spectral projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDG methods neglect available textual descriptions of target environments, which could guide model generalization without requiring target data.

Method: STAR module uses target-anchored subspace from text embeddings to recenter image features, spectral projection to retain target-aligned directions, vision-language distillation, and feature-space Mixup.

Result: Superior performance across various image classification and object detection benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Minimal textual metadata significantly enhances generalization under data constraints, enabling robust deployment in target environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ILRNet is a novel iterative low-rank network that combines model-driven and data-driven approaches for hyperspectral image denoising, achieving state-of-the-art performance through wavelet domain rank minimization and adaptive iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image denoising is crucial for subsequent tasks, and while clean HSIs reside in low-dimensional subspaces with low-rank properties, it's challenging to effectively use these physical properties while preserving image details.

Method: ILRNet integrates a rank minimization module within U-Net architecture, transforming features to wavelet domain and applying singular value thresholding to low-frequency components. It features adaptive parameter learning and iterative refinement that combines intermediate results with noisy inputs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: ILRNet effectively leverages spectral low-rankness in feature domain through adaptive learning and iterative refinement, providing superior HSI denoising while preserving image details.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Motivation: Existing surgical video understanding systems have inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness, limiting versatile CAS solutions.

Method: Proposes SurgLLM with Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for spatial focus, Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) for temporal reasoning, and Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble for task handling.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in diverse surgical video understanding tasks including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA.

Conclusion: SurgLLM is effective for versatile surgical video understanding with enhanced spatial and temporal capabilities, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness

*Guangzong Si,Hao Yin,Xianfei Li,Qing Ding,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations in MLLMs share the same cause, proposing instead that they have distinct origins and introducing VPFC method to reduce omissions without increasing fabrications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing object hallucination in MLLMs are flawed because they assume omission and fabrication hallucinations share a common cause, leading to solutions that reduce omissions but trigger more fabrications.

Method: The authors propose Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method based on their Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field framework, which reveals how models construct visual evidence to infer object presence/absence.

Result: VPFC effectively reduces omission hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations, demonstrating that the two types of hallucinations have distinct causes that require different mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The research reveals a critical oversight in current object hallucination research and provides new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination mitigation strategies by addressing omission and fabrication hallucinations as distinct phenomena.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage I computes adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources to suppress harmful behaviors. Stage II refines these vectors through sequence-level preference optimization with toxicity assessment and visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment.

Result: SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks through activation steering and preference optimization while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework effectively balances efficiency and effectiveness, providing robust defense against adversarial attacks while preserving the model's visual grounding performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

### [29] [Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00374)
*Mengke Li,Lihao Chen,Peng Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APPT method enables direct 3D point cloud processing by fine-tuning pre-trained models with minimal parameters, using point embeddings and permutation-invariant features to preserve spatial geometries without heterogeneous mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training large 3D models is challenging due to point cloud data scarcity, and existing "high-to-low" mapping approaches lose spatial geometries and lack generalizability across modalities for 3D adaptation.

Method: Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) converts point clouds to embeddings with local geometry aggregation, uses permutation-invariant features for relative positions, and employs a weight-sharing prompt generator to produce point-prompts for self-attention calibration.

Result: The method enables direct point cloud processing without heterogeneous mappings, preserves spatial geometries, and provides rich global structural information while minimizing computational overhead and parameter count.

Conclusion: APPT offers a generalizable framework for adapting any modality's foundation model to 3D point cloud analysis through efficient parameter tuning and spatial geometry preservation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseCutMix: A novel data augmentation method that combines CutMix with diffusion models to generate natural, high-resolution images by fusing noise from two different classes during the diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image combination methods like CutMix often produce unnatural boundaries due to contextual differences between classes. The authors aim to leverage diffusion models' ability to generate natural, high-resolution images while maintaining the diverse augmentation benefits of CutMix.

Method: The proposed NoiseCutMix method partially combines the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model, enabling natural fusion of characteristics from both classes during the image generation process.

Result: The method was validated through classification experiments, showing effectiveness compared to conventional data augmentation techniques, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix successfully addresses the unnatural boundary issue in traditional CutMix while maintaining the benefits of diverse data augmentation through diffusion model-based noise fusion, demonstrating superior performance in classification tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

### [31] [Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00379)
*Jialiang Kang,Jiawen Wang,Dingsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods (UDAKD and FSKD) to transfer knowledge from 2D image models to 3D LiDAR segmentation without requiring 3D annotations, leveraging synchronized camera-LiDAR data in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation requires extensive annotated point cloud data which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, while 2D image datasets are more readily available and abundant.

Method: Uses crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence to align 3D network outputs with 2D network outputs. Employs self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds for domain adaptation, preserving modality-general information while filtering modality-specific details.

Result: The proposed methods consistently surpass state-of-the-art approaches in performance, validated through rigorous experimentation.

Conclusion: The crossmodal knowledge distillation approach effectively reduces the annotation burden for 3D LiDAR segmentation by leveraging readily available 2D image data and models, achieving superior performance without requiring 3D annotations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

### [32] [Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in Researcher-Participant Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00381)
*Runtong Wu,Jiayao Song,Fei Teng,Xianhao Ren,Yuyan Gao,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAME is a new paradigm that transforms research documents into coherent story images to reduce cognitive burden in narrative inquiry, using only 0.96% of data while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the immense burden of data analysis in narrative inquiry where researchers must transform various data into hand-drafted narratives and participants face heavy member checking requirements.

Method: Proposed NAME paradigm with actor location and shape module for plausible image generation, and developed evaluation metrics for perceptual quality and narrative consistency.

Result: Achieved FID score reduction from 195 to 152 using only 0.96% data, with substantial improvements across different data splits (70:30: 175→152, 95:5: 96→49) and scored 3.62 vs baseline 2.66 on new metric.

Conclusion: NAME successfully reduces cognitive burden in narrative inquiry by generating coherent story images from documents, demonstrating efficient performance with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

*Joohyun Chang,Soyeon Hong,Hyogun Lee,Seong Jong Ha,Dongho Lee,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO-VQL is a novel method for egocentric visual query localization that handles viewpoint changes and occlusions through top-down attention guidance and egocentric augmentation with consistency training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric videos have frequent viewpoint changes causing object appearance variations and occlusions, making accurate object localization challenging for existing methods.

Method: Proposes HERO-VQL with two components: 1) Top-down Attention Guidance using class token for context and PCA score maps for localization, 2) Egocentric Augmentation with Consistency Training that enhances query diversity and simulates viewpoint changes.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQ2D dataset show HERO-VQL significantly outperforms baseline methods in handling egocentric challenges.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses egocentric visual query localization challenges by mimicking human cognitive processes and using novel attention mechanisms with robust augmentation strategies.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

### [34] [Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395)
*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCDM is a parameter-efficient diffusion model for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction that uses frozen pre-trained weights with trainable double-constraint controllers to handle different dose levels without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-dose PET reduces radiation exposure but increases noise and reduces image quality. Current methods lack flexibility for different dose levels and require extensive retraining.

Method: Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM) with frozen pre-trained diffusion model weights and two trainable constraint modules: Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) for low-rank feature compression and Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC) for diffusion model control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose reduction factors and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, effective even at 1% of full dose on UDPET and Clinical datasets.

Conclusion: DCDM provides flexible, parameter-efficient ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction with excellent performance across various dose levels without requiring full model retraining.

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

### [35] [DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396)
*Ryosuke Seshimo,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DAOVI, a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting that addresses distortion in equirectangular projection through geodesic distance-based motion evaluation and depth-aware feature propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional videos capture entire surroundings but often contain unwanted objects. Existing video inpainting methods don't handle the distortion in equirectangular projection of 360-degree videos.

Method: Introduces Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI) with two key modules: 1) temporal motion evaluation using geodesic distance in image space, and 2) depth-aware feature propagation in feature space to handle geometric distortion.

Result: Experimental results show DAOVI outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in omnidirectional video inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the unique challenges of omnidirectional video inpainting by incorporating distortion-aware modules that consider geodesic distance and depth information.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yushuo Chen,Ruizhi Shao,Youxin Pang,Hongwen Zhang,Xinyi Wu,Rihui Wu,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that uses video generative models to reconstruct detailed human avatars from monocular videos by generating additional viewpoint supervision and employing physical identity injection with patch-based denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle to capture fine-grained dynamic details and generate plausible novel viewpoints due to limited model capacity and insufficient observational data from monocular videos.

Method: Leverages Human4DiT video generative model to generate human motions from alternative perspectives as additional supervision. Uses video fine-tuning to inject physical identity for consistent motion reproduction and employs patch-based denoising for higher-resolution outputs.

Result: Outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating enriched details in unseen regions and reduced artifacts through effective regularization of avatar representation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in human avatar reconstruction by utilizing video generative models and complementary strategies, achieving superior performance in capturing fine-grained details and generating plausible novel viewpoints.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM is a training-free method that accelerates Vision-Language Models by reducing tokens during encoding and compressing KV Cache during decoding, achieving significant speed improvements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from slow inference speeds due to high computational demands in both encoding (processing image tokens) and decoding (generating long text sequences), which hinders real-world deployment.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pyramid token merging during encoding to hierarchically reduce image tokens while keeping dominant ones, 2) KV Cache compression during decoding to remove unnecessary caches and increase throughput.

Result: Achieves 100% performance with only 35% image tokens, 98% performance with 3% tokens. Increases throughput by 2.02x, reduces prefilling time by 3.65x, and cuts inference time by 3.21x for long sequences (4096 tokens).

Conclusion: LightVLM enables efficient deployment of large VLMs by significantly accelerating inference while preserving performance, making heavy models faster than smaller counterparts and facilitating practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines while maintaining photorealism in face generation tasks.

Method: Uses mask-conditioned space factorization for semantic-decoupled latent modeling, mixture of global and local experts for structure/semantics capture, and dynamic time-dependent gating network.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation with robust zero-shot generalization capability.

Conclusion: Provides a powerful and flexible solution for high-quality controllable face generation with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL introduces semantic reordering and retrieval state space modules to improve WSI analysis with linear complexity while preserving histological context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for whole slide images either overlook contextual relationships (attention-based) or have quadratic complexity/overfitting issues (Transformers), while state space models lose interpretability when shuffling patch order.

Method: SemaMIL integrates Semantic Reordering (clusters and arranges semantically similar patches through reversible permutation) with Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (selects representative query subset to adjust state space parameters for better global modeling).

Result: Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SemaMIL effectively addresses limitations of current MIL approaches by combining semantic-aware ordering with efficient state space modeling, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label ambiguity is a major challenge in age estimation, and existing methods that model correlations between adjacent age groups often overlook the varying degrees of ambiguity across different age stages.

Method: Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) algorithm that leverages embedding similarity analysis to identify stage-wise ambiguity patterns, using stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss functions.

Result: Achieves MAE of 1.74 on MORPH-II and 2.15 on FG-NET datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in age estimation.

Conclusion: SA-LDL effectively captures the complex structured nature of label ambiguity through stage-wise modeling, leading to more accurate and robust age estimation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

TL;DR: EOIR framework uses 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and separate flow estimators to achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-off in deformable image registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in learning-based deformable image registration including computational complexity and handling large deformations by understanding ConvNet roles in registration.

Method: Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework that separates feature learning from flow estimation, using 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and 3-layer flow estimators to build Laplacian feature pyramid for progressive diffeomorphic deformations.

Result: Superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs across five datasets of different modalities and anatomical regions, with comparable accuracy but better efficiency/smoothness.

Conclusion: EOIR effectively addresses registration challenges by leveraging insights about ConvNet roles, providing a practical solution with publicly available code for deformable image registration.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

### [43] [VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484)
*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal reward models in video understanding, covering perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety with 1,563 high-quality annotated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal reward models in video domain suffer from limited question diversity, lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate coverage of different MRM types.

Method: Created VideoRewardBench using AI-assisted data pipeline with 1,563 annotated triplets (video-text prompt, chosen response, rejected response), covering 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions. Evaluated 28 MRMs across generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar categories.

Result: Top-performing GPT-4o achieved only 57.0% accuracy, state-of-the-art open-source Qwen2.5-VL-72B reached 53.3%. Key insights: RL-trained MRMs don't necessarily have better cross-modal generalization; most MRMs benefit from inference-time scaling; video frame count variations affect different MRM types differently.

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench provides a challenging and valuable benchmark that reveals significant performance gaps in current MRMs and offers insights for advancing multimodal reward model development in video domain.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

### [44] [Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490)
*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STVH and M-STVH techniques for group activity video retrieval, focusing on spatiotemporal modeling of both group interactions and individual object dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With explosive growth of video data, there's an urgent need for quick retrieval of group activities at granular level rather than entire videos. Existing methods cannot effectively retrieve activity-level content.

Method: STVH: unified framework modeling individual object dynamics and group interactions simultaneously, capturing spatiotemporal evolution. M-STVH: enhanced version with hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning to jointly focus on activity semantics and object visual features.

Result: Both STVH and M-STVH achieved excellent results in comparative experiments on publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively address the problem of granular group activity retrieval in videos by modeling both spatiotemporal group interactions and individual object dynamics, with M-STVH providing enhanced multi-focused capabilities.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

### [45] [TRUST: Token-dRiven Ultrasound Style Transfer for Cross-Device Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00508)
*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST is a token-driven dual-stream framework for ultrasound image style transfer that preserves content while transferring target domain style, improving downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods don't adequately filter style features relevant to downstream tasks, causing misalignment between translated images and task requirements.

Method: Proposes TRUST with Token-dRiven module that selects suitable target tokens from data and model perspectives, uses behavior mirror loss, and injects auxiliary prompts to match content representation with downstream behavior.

Result: Outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance on ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: TRUST effectively bridges the style gap in ultrasound images while maintaining content integrity for improved downstream task performance.

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

*Yasser Benigmim,Subhankar Roy,Khalid Oublal,Imad Eddine Marouf,Slim Essid,Vicky Kalogeiton,Stéphane Lathuilière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATGC method enables effective black-box model distillation using only one-hot predictions by dynamically selecting optimal input scales through attention-guided analysis, overcoming resolution sensitivity limitations in open-vocabulary APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AIaaS provides access to powerful pre-trained models via APIs, but current domain adaptation methods fail when models are black-box (no weights, training data, or logits exposed), requiring new approaches that work with only one-hot predictions.

Method: ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) leverages DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal input scales for black-box model inference. It scores attention maps with entropy to identify informative scales for pseudo-labeling, enabling effective distillation with only one-hot API predictions.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the scale selection approach.

Conclusion: ATGC successfully addresses the black-box distillation challenge by exploiting attention-guided scale selection, enabling local model adaptation without access to model internals and overcoming the resolution sensitivity limitation of open-vocabulary models.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

*Ruitao Wu,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBD framework uses language semantics from CLIP to disentangle catastrophic semantic entanglement in class-incremental semantic segmentation, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic semantic entanglement (prototype-feature and background-increment entanglement) in CISS that causes noise and errors in existing methods.

Method: Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement with Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement (using text features as templates) and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement (multiple learnable prototypes with mask-pooling supervision).

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC and ADE20k datasets, especially in multi-step scenarios.

Conclusion: Leveraging language semantics effectively addresses fundamental entanglement challenges in CISS and bridges CLIP's capability gap for dense tasks.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainFM is a modality-agnostic vision foundation model for brain imaging that handles diverse MR contrasts and protocols through novel training strategies, enabling robust performance across five fundamental tasks without modality-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based approaches work well for calibrated imaging like CT but struggle with uncalibrated MR modalities due to sensitivity to contrast, resolution, and orientation differences, limiting real-world clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes 'mild-to-severe' intra-subject generation and 'real-synth' mix-up training strategy to make the model resilient to appearance variations. The model handles five tasks: image synthesis for CT/T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration.

Result: Evaluated on eleven public datasets, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. The model shows strong generalization across diverse clinical protocols.

Conclusion: BrainFM provides a versatile foundation model that overcomes modality-specific limitations and enables broad applicability to real-world clinical brain imaging scenarios without requiring task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Ilyes Benaissa,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Abdenour Hadid,Vito Renó,Cosimo Distante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) to enhance DiffusionDet by integrating global scene context with local features using cross-attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on vehicle damage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained object detection in challenging domains like vehicle damage assessment is difficult even for humans. DiffusionDet's performance is limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios.

Method: Introduces Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) that uses cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context (captured by a separate dedicated encoder) with local proposal features, enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information.

Result: Experimental results show improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling comprehensive environmental context integration, addressing fundamental limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

*Boyi Li,Ce Zhang,Richard M. Timmerman,Wenxuan Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGL-RSIS is a training-free framework that enables vision language models to perform remote sensing image segmentation by decoupling visual and textual inputs and aligning them at both local semantic and global contextual levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring vision language models from natural images to remote sensing segmentation is challenging due to limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery.

Method: Proposes a global-local decoupling module that separates text into class nouns and modifiers, partitions images into mask proposals, aligns features through context-aware cropping and RS-specific knowledge enrichment, and uses Cross-Scale Grad-CAM with mask selection for global-local alignment.

Result: The framework enables open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and referring expression segmentation without additional training, achieving accurate and interpretable alignment across global and local dimensions.

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS successfully bridges the domain gap for remote sensing segmentation by decoupling and aligning visual-textual inputs at multiple scales, providing a training-free solution for VLMs in RS applications.

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML models trained on unorthorectified satellite data achieve methane detection performance comparable to orthorectified data, enabling faster detection with reduced preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas requiring rapid detection for climate mitigation. Current methods need complex preprocessing like orthorectification, which adds time and computational costs.

Method: Novel approach using unorthorectified hyperspectral data (UnorthoDOS) from EMIT sensor, bypassing traditional preprocessing steps. ML models trained on both orthorectified and unorthorectified datasets.

Result: ML models on unorthorectified data perform comparably to orthorectified data models. Both outperform traditional matched filter baseline (mag1c).

Conclusion: Unorthorectified data enables effective methane detection without preprocessing, supporting faster onboard satellite ML deployment with reduced downlink costs.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

TL;DR: MV-SSM introduces a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework for robust 3D human pose estimation that generalizes better to new camera configurations than existing attention-based transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based transformers struggle with spatial arrangement modeling of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios, and overfit to specific camera arrangements, causing performance drops in new settings.

Method: Proposes a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework with Projective State Space (PSS) blocks to model joint spatial sequences at feature and keypoint levels, using Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS) instead of traditional Mamba scanning.

Result: MV-SSM achieves significant improvements: +10.8 AP25 (+24%) on CMU Panoptic three-camera setting, +7.0 AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various challenging multi-view 3D human pose estimation scenarios.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

TL;DR: Neural network approach for automatic jewelry identification and description using computer vision and image captioning across three hierarchical levels, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translators and interpreters need comprehensive jewelry knowledge but currently rely on industry experts. There's a need for automated systems to provide accurate jewelry descriptions for non-experts.

Method: Uses neural networks with computer vision and image captioning techniques. Employs different captioning architectures to detect jewels and generate descriptions at three hierarchical levels. Created comprehensive jewelry image database for training and evaluation.

Result: Final model achieved captioning accuracy exceeding 90% after thorough evaluation of various image captioning architectures, with encoder-decoder model being particularly effective.

Conclusion: The approach successfully automates jewelry identification and description, providing translators and interpreters with quick access to accurate jewelry information through natural language descriptions at multiple detail levels.

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ introduces a dual-encoder framework combining semantic and perception-focused encoders to address MLLMs' fine-grained visual perception limitations, achieving superior performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at high-level semantic understanding but fail at basic visual tasks requiring precise detail perception due to single vision encoder architectures that sacrifice fine-grained visual information capture.

Method: FtZ framework composes a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder using lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism, moving beyond single-encoder designs.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-encoder baselines and existing feature fusion methods on benchmarks like TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet that demand fine-grained visual understanding.

Conclusion: Composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective approach to overcome visual perception bottlenecks in MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STM strategy for weather-generalized monocular depth estimation using parameter-efficient fine-tuning of vision foundation models with minimal normal data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions is challenging due to lack of reliable ground truth and domain gaps in synthetic data. Self-supervised methods fail due to violated photometric assumptions.

Method: Introduces Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM) strategy that structurally decomposes pretrained VFM weights using entropy-rank and stable-rank. Adaptively selects rank number and task-aware singular directions for initialization, with principal direction regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions show STM outperforms existing PEFT methods, full fine-tuning, and methods using adverse synthetic data.

Conclusion: STM achieves effective weather-generalized depth estimation while preserving pretrained VFM generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance across adverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training multimodal critic models with reinforcement learning on preference data produces unified models that excel at both evaluation and generation tasks, outperforming specialized vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional separation between critic models (for evaluation) and policy models (for generation) in vision-language modeling by exploring whether critics can also serve as effective policy models.

Method: Reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B) to create LLaVA-Critic models that optimize preference judgments while maintaining generation capabilities.

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges as both a top-performing critic and competitive policy model, achieving +5.7% average gain over base model across 26 benchmarks. LLaVA-Critic-R1+ achieves 71.9 SoTA on MMMU at 7B scale. Self-critique at inference yields +13.8% improvement on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RL training on critic data can produce unified models that excel at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems that break the traditional critic-policy separation.

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

*Qingyu Wang,Xue Jiang,Guozheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CSFMamba Network for multimodal remote sensing image classification, combining Mamba's efficiency with CNN to fuse HSI and LiDAR data while reducing computational burden compared to Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity, making long-range dependency modeling burdensome. Mamba offers efficient computation but cannot perform direct feature fusion.

Method: Designs preprocessing module for Mamba structure, combines with CNN for multi-layer feature extraction, and creates cross-state module using Mamba operator for modality fusion. Combines Mamba and CNN advantages in backbone design.

Result: Outperforms Transformer results on MUUFL and Houston2018 datasets while reducing network training burden, achieving stronger full-image understanding of HSI and LiDAR fusion.

Conclusion: CSFMamba successfully leverages Mamba's computational efficiency for multimodal remote sensing classification, demonstrating superior performance with reduced training burden compared to Transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

TL;DR: CascadeFormer is a two-stage transformer framework for skeleton-based action recognition, using masked pretraining followed by cascading fine-tuning, achieving competitive results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have dominated skeleton-based action recognition due to spatiotemporal structure, recent advances in transformers and masked pretraining offer new opportunities for representation learning in this domain.

Method: Proposes CascadeFormer - a two-stage cascading transformer framework with masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage specifically designed for discriminative action classification.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across three benchmark datasets: Penn Action, N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed CascadeFormer framework successfully leverages transformer architectures and masked pretraining for skeleton-based human action recognition, providing a viable alternative to dominant GCN approaches with strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a benchmark to evaluate projection layer generalization in Vision-Language Models, finding it retains 79-88% performance on unseen concepts and functions like a key-value memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the importance of projection layers in VLMs that map visual features to language embeddings, their ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated.

Method: Adapted object detection datasets into prompting format with disjoint train/test splits to control seen/unseen concept separation, and analyzed projection layer behavior through mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Projection layer retains 79-88% performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones, functioning like a key-value memory that processes seen and unseen tokens similarly.

Conclusion: The study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and shows potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data due to the projection layer's generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos,Tanaya Maslekar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that reduces skin tone bias by analyzing feature map skewness in VGG and Vision Transformer networks, focusing on lesion areas rather than skin color.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about potential biases related to skin color in deep learning models for skin lesion classification, which can impact diagnostic outcomes and healthcare equity. Current methods face challenges with skin tone classification, high computational demands, and complex fairness verification.

Method: Calculate skewness of feature maps in VGG network convolution layers and Vision Transformer patches/heads to identify and reduce unnecessary channels related to skin tone. This focuses the model on lesion areas rather than skin color characteristics.

Result: The approach reduces computational costs, mitigates bias without conventional statistical methods, potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed fairness algorithm effectively addresses skin tone bias in skin lesion classification by focusing on lesion features rather than skin color, offering a computationally efficient solution that maintains diagnostic accuracy while promoting equitable healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### [62] [Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749)
*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE method uses Effective Receptive Field to causally identify image patches that drive SAE feature activations in vision transformers, revealing hidden context dependencies that naive activation maps miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inspection of SAE features by looking at highest activation patches is misleading because self-attention mixes information across images, causing activated patches to co-occur with but not necessarily cause feature firing.

Method: Proposed Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE) that leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF) and applies input-attribution methods to identify image patches that causally drive each SAE feature activation.

Result: ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies. Patch insertion tests confirm CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches.

Conclusion: CaFE provides more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location analysis.

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and caption-guided semantic matching achieves top performance in event-based image retrieval from free-form captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches struggle with abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, and complex narratives in free-form captions.

Method: Multi-stage framework using Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, Qwen2-VL for image scoring, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion for output fusion.

Result: Achieved top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: Combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval is effective for complex, real-world image understanding from event descriptions.

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNN-based pipelines struggle with cross-modal semantics in medical imaging, particularly in low-resource clinical settings where limited data is available for ENT endoscopy analysis.

Method: Leverages CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), multi-level CLS token aggregation, spherical feature interpolation, and class-specific natural language prompts. Uses joint training combining supervised classification with contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 (image-to-image) and 0.92 (text-to-image), MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96 in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource settings, with ablation studies confirming the incremental benefits of each architectural component for ENT endoscopy analysis.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing popularity of 3DGS creates need for effective copyright protection; current methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning for each message.

Method: GaussianBridge transforms unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format for neural processing, uses Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap for imperceptibility, and dense segmentation-based extraction for robust recovery.

Result: Enables efficient watermark embedding through single forward pass while maintaining visual quality and reliable extraction even with minimal watermarked regions.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides the first generalizable solution for 3DGS watermarking that is efficient, imperceptible, and robust against various rendering conditions.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely

*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Toxic Siblings' bias in HOI detection transformers where similar triplets interfere with each other, and proposes two debiasing objectives that significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection transformers for human-object interaction detection suffer from 'Toxic Siblings' bias where similar HOI triplets compete and interfere with each other, reducing precision despite their similarity.

Method: Proposes two debiasing objectives: 1) 'contrastive-then-calibration' for input perspective - samples incorrect sibling-like triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones using positional priors; 2) 'merge-then-split' for output perspective - learns shared features among sibling categories then refines intra-group differentiation.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing methods effectively address the Toxic Siblings bias problem in HOI detection transformers, achieving substantial performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation works focus on isolated people in empty scenes, lacking realistic human-object interactions due to limited datasets with diverse object manipulations.

Method: Proposed an automatic motion extraction pipeline to collect interaction-rich human motions from 45.8K videos, creating the InterPose dataset with 3D motions and text captions.

Result: InterPose brings significant improvements to state-of-the-art human motion generation methods and enables development of an LLM-based agent for zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.

Conclusion: The InterPose dataset successfully addresses the lack of large-scale human-object interaction data and enables more realistic and versatile human motion generation in complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern face retrieval systems often outsource retrieval to third parties, posing significant privacy risks to user portraits. Homomorphic encryption provides strong security but is computationally inefficient for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical two-stage framework: 1) high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing for fast candidate filtering, and 2) fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for precise face ranking. Includes tailored protection mechanism for cancelable biometric authentication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method achieves a decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Conclusion: The proposed Cancelable Product Quantization framework provides an efficient solution for secure face representation retrieval that addresses privacy concerns while maintaining practical performance for real-time applications.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Result: Quantitative experiments show AAGLSD effectively extracts complete line segments compared to other advanced detectors across various datasets.

Conclusion: AAGLSD provides a robust solution for line segment detection with high precision and completeness, avoiding complex refinement strategies while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency

from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed

Motivation: Existing visual prosthesis approaches struggle to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity and lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate biological plausibility of predicted stimuli.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) pre-trained CLIP visual encoder for semantic feature extraction, and 2) cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising with dynamic interaction between visual features and brain representations.

Result: Evaluated on THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Visualized training/test M/EEG topographies showing intra-subject and inter-subject variations.

Conclusion: The cross-attention enhanced DDPM framework successfully addresses the biological plausibility issue in brain signal generation for visual prostheses, providing improved alignment between visual stimuli and brain responses.

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

TL;DR: OmniReason framework introduces spatiotemporal reasoning for autonomous driving with large-scale datasets and an agent architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance in planning and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models focus on static scene understanding but neglect the temporal dimension essential for real-world driving scenarios, creating a critical limitation in autonomous driving systems.

Method: Proposes OmniReason framework with two advances: (1) OmniReason-Data - large-scale VLA datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations using hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling, (2) OmniReason-Agent architecture with sparse temporal memory module and explanation generator using spatiotemporal knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Establishes new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments through robust spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

*Changin Choi,Wonseok Lee,Jungmin Ko,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MI-RAG is a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning for visual question answering by using iterative query formulation and joint search across multimodal knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional single-pass RAG frameworks often fail to gather sufficient knowledge for knowledge-intensive visual questions, limiting MLLM performance on tasks requiring external knowledge beyond images.

Method: Proposes MI-RAG framework that uses iterative reasoning: dynamically formulates multi-queries from accumulated reasoning records, performs joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases (visually-grounded and textual), and synthesizes new knowledge into reasoning records across iterations.

Result: Significant improvements in both retrieval recall and answer accuracy on challenging benchmarks including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA.

Conclusion: MI-RAG establishes a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA by progressively refining understanding through iterative knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

TL;DR: Novel semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for underwater 3D reconstruction using multimodal cross-knowledge and CLIP semantic features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater 3D reconstruction faces challenges like light distortion and turbidity. Existing AI methods don't fully exploit language-vision integration potential for semantic understanding.

Method: Embed semantic features into Gaussian primitives supervised by CLIP, use semantic consistency loss, and implement stage-wise training with coarse-to-fine learning and late-stage parameter refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets with up to 3.09 dB PSNR improvement on average.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust, high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction and is suitable for underwater exploration and marine perception applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM) improves fetal ultrasound classification by mimicking clinical contrast adjustment practices, enhancing various models' accuracy by 1-2% across multi-center data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal ultrasound classification faces challenges like low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations that limit diagnostic reliability.

Method: ACAM uses a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, creates multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers.

Result: Validated on 12,400 multi-center images across six anatomical categories, ACAM improved accuracy: lightweight models +2.02%, traditional models +1.29%, state-of-the-art models +1.15%.

Conclusion: The module bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics through physics-informed transformations aligned with sonographer workflows, establishing a new paradigm for robust medical image analysis under real-world quality variations.

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM), a gradient-based adversarial attack method that reformulates the optimization objective and uses a three-layer cycle-stage-step framework with different loss functions to achieve stronger attack performance and higher cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient adversarial attack methods for better assessing the robustness of computer vision models by reconstructing the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples.

Method: SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework (cycle-stage-step) with different loss functions: initial stage uses negative probability of true label to compress solution space, subsequent stages use Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss to gradually increase non-true labels' probability upper bound.

Result: SDM demonstrates stronger attack performance and higher attack cost-effectiveness compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, and can be combined with adversarial training to enhance defensive effects.

Conclusion: SDM provides an effective gradient-based adversarial attack method that outperforms existing approaches in both performance and efficiency, while also being compatible with adversarial training for improved defense.

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

TL;DR: Novel texture defect detection using Gabor filters and blurring U-Net-ViT model with Gaussian filter loss and SP masking, achieving 0.939 AUC across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection by addressing background noise and improving defect pattern recognition in various textures and noisy environments.

Method: Combines U-Net's local feature training with Vision Transformer's global processing, uses Gaussian filter-based loss for noise removal, SP masking for boundary reinforcement, and Gabor filters in post-processing for defect orientation/frequency emphasis.

Result: Achieved average AUC of 0.939 across MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly datasets, with ablation studies validating optimal filter size and noise probability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects surface defects across various textures with robust performance in noisy environments through optimized parameter settings and hybrid architecture.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

*Zhijing Wu,Longguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussian attributes to handle motion blur in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail due to motion blur undermining pose estimation, leading to accumulated errors and inferior reconstruction results in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: Incorporates camera poses as learnable parameters with 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization, models motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations, and uses a three-stage training schedule alternating between pose and Gaussian optimization.

Result: Achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy on Stereo Blur dataset and real-world sequences compared to prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: The unified optimization framework effectively addresses motion blur issues by jointly optimizing camera poses and 3D Gaussian representations, improving both reconstruction quality and pose accuracy.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: SegDINO provides an efficient segmentation framework that preserves the representational power of foundation features while minimizing trainable parameters and computational costs.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for

Motivation: Atmospheric interference and haze degrade satellite image clarity and reduce information extraction accuracy, requiring effective dehazing solutions for remote sensing applications.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating Swin Transformer and U-Net with SwinRRDB blocks in encoder/decoder, using composite loss (L2 + guided + watershed loss) for global context learning and local detail restoration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on RICE and SateHaze1K datasets, achieving PSNR of 33.24 dB and SSIM of 0.967 on RICE dataset - significant improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery with strong structural preservation, demonstrating potential for diverse remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel view synthesis method that decomposes single-view synthesis into 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by view interpolation using panorama diffusion and video diffusion models, ensuring long-term consistency and flexible camera control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view novel view synthesis methods fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories, especially for views significantly deviating from the input.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) 360-degree scene extrapolation using panorama diffusion model to learn scene prior, 2) Novel view interpolation using perspective keyframes warped from panorama and fed into pre-trained video diffusion model with spatial noise diffusion process.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories, maintains global consistency even in loop closure scenarios, and enables flexible camera control.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach effectively addresses long-term view and scene consistency challenges in single-view novel view synthesis, providing superior performance across diverse scene datasets.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

TL;DR: FQAT is a flatness-oriented quantization-aware training method that addresses OOD generalization degradation in quantized models through layer-wise freezing and adaptive algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT methods focus only on in-distribution performance but cause significant degradation on out-of-distribution data, creating a need for generalizable quantization.

Method: Proposes FQAT with layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate gradient conflicts and disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm with gradient disorder metric to dynamically freeze unstable layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on OOD benchmarks show FQAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.

Conclusion: FQAT successfully addresses OOD generalization issues in QAT by optimizing for flat loss landscapes through intelligent layer freezing strategies.

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

TL;DR: A new pose-based scoliosis screening method using dual representation framework with continuous skeleton maps and discrete asymmetry vectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI scoliosis screening relies on silhouette data, missing clinically important postural asymmetries. Pose data offers better clinical interpretability but faces challenges with dataset scarcity and noise sensitivity.

Method: Created Scoliosis1K-Pose dataset with 447,900 pose frames. Developed Dual Representation Framework (DRF) combining continuous skeleton maps with discrete Postural Asymmetry Vectors (PAV), plus PAV-Guided Attention module to focus on clinically meaningful asymmetries.

Result: DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in scoliosis screening. Visualizations confirm the model effectively uses clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and synergize dual representations.

Conclusion: The pose-based approach with dual representation framework successfully addresses limitations of previous methods, providing clinically interpretable scoliosis screening with improved performance. Dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's prompt tuning achieves cross-modal alignment but suffers from redundant features that introduce noise and computational costs. There's a need to enhance both accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning by focusing on the most informative visual tokens.

Method: Proposes Spotlighter framework that evaluates visual tokens from sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives, retains top-scoring tokens, uses a class-specific semantic memory bank with learned prototypes, and implements a two-level ranking mechanism for dynamic token-prototype interaction weighting.

Result: Outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19% in harmonic mean accuracy across 11 few-shot benchmarks, achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters.

Conclusion: Spotlighter establishes an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for

Motivation: Low-light RAW video denoising is challenging due to severe signal degradation from high sensor gain and short exposure times required by video frame rates.

Method: Combines two key innovations: (1) metadata conditioning scheme adapted from image denoising to guide alignment and denoising, and (2) Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) mechanism for modeling long-range temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieved first place in AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on rigorous benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DarkVRAI sets a new standard for low-light video denoising through synergistic combination of metadata conditioning and temporal modeling, effectively addressing the fundamental challenges of low-light video capture.

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

*Xiangchen Wang,Jinrui Zhang,Teng Wang,Haigang Zhang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC is a language-aware dynamic token compressor that uses a lightweight language model to convert video clips into soft caption tokens, dynamically adjusting compression ratios based on scene richness to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video token compression methods use fixed ratios, ignoring semantic density variations, leading to inadequate representation of information-rich clips and wasted computation on content-poor ones.

Method: Leverages a lightweight language model to describe video clips into soft caption tokens, trained with semantic density-aware supervision to dynamically adjust compression ratios based on description length.

Result: Reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance, with qualitative results showing adaptive token compression based on video segment richness.

Conclusion: LangDC successfully mimics human dynamic expression patterns, providing efficient and adaptive token compression that balances computational efficiency with representation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

### [86] [Towards Integrating Multi-Spectral Imaging with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00989)
*Josef Grün,Lukas Meyer,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents methods to integrate RGB and multi-spectral imagery into 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing geometry inconsistency issues across spectral bands and proposing optimized joint optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS works well on RGB data but naive per-band optimization of additional spectral bands yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistent geometry appearance across different spectral modalities, despite the actual geometry being the same.

Method: Three strategies evaluated: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction, 2) Splitting optimization (first optimize RGB geometry then fit new bands), 3) Joint optimization (modalities optimized together, optionally with initial RGB-only phase). Multi-spectral data is integrated into spherical harmonics color components.

Result: The dedicated optimized Joint strategy significantly improves overall spectral reconstruction and enhances RGB results through spectral cross-talk. The analysis reveals key trade-offs for introducing spectral bands during optimization.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-spectral data directly into spherical harmonics color components effectively models each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance, providing practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

*Ghazal Farhani,Taufiq Rahman,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rainy conditions cause drivers to exhibit different gaze patterns including more dashboard glances, longer fixations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating increased cognitive focus compared to clear weather driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rainy weather increases road accident risks due to reduced visibility and traction. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior is critical for designing better driver monitoring systems (DMS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Method: Case study analyzing eye gaze behavior on same highway route under clear vs rainy conditions. Used two-step clustering: first clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. Also employed Markov transition matrices, fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distribution metrics.

Result: While overall gaze behavior (road focus with occasional mirror checks) remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to: more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation. These changes indicate increased cognitive focus during adverse weather.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of leveraging gaze modeling to design more robust ADAS and DMS systems that account for weather-related behavioral adaptations.

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: The automated system successfully demonstrates scalable coral restoration with high accuracy, reducing human dependency while increasing efficiency and range of deployment operations.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral
species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their
success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5

*Zixin Zhu,Kevin Duarte,Mamshad Nayeem Rizve,Chengyuan Xu,Ratheesh Kalarot,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSlider enables simultaneous control of multiple image attributes in text-to-image generation using disentangled sliders, avoiding attribute interference while maintaining structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slider-based methods train individual adapters per attribute, causing interference between attributes and preventing precise multi-attribute control due to attribute entanglement.

Method: CompSlider generates a conditional prior for T2I foundation models, uses disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining image consistency, and operates in latent space without retraining the base model.

Result: The approach successfully controls multiple attributes simultaneously without interference, reduces computational burden, and demonstrates generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: CompSlider provides an effective solution for disentangled multi-attribute control in T2I generation, offering precise manipulation while maintaining structural integrity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

*Qiang Li,Yuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an all-in-one model for restoring images taken through glass contaminated by various particles using one-shot test-time adaptation with self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic data or only handle specific contaminants like raindrops, but real-world glass contamination includes diverse particles like mud, dirt, and foreign materials that require more robust solutions.

Method: Uses real paired images for training and proposes an all-in-one model with one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism that includes self-supervised auxiliary learning to update the model for each test image's unique occlusion type.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially on unseen contaminated images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles diverse real-world glass contaminants through test-time adaptation and self-supervised learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LPFM, the first unified low-level pathology foundation model that handles multiple image enhancement tasks including super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and virtual staining through a single adaptable architecture with contrastive pre-training and conditional diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pathology images suffer from degradations like noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts and staining variability, while existing methods are task-specific and lack versatility for diverse low-level vision challenges.

Method: Uses contrastive pre-trained encoder from 190M unlabeled pathology images to learn stain-invariant features, combined with unified conditional diffusion process that adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts. Trained on 87,810 WSIs across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols.

Result: Statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving 10-15% PSNR gains for image restoration and 12-18% SSIM improvements for virtual staining.

Conclusion: LPFM successfully bridges the gap in low-level pathology image enhancement by providing a unified foundation model capable of handling multiple enhancement tasks through a single architecture with superior performance over specialized methods.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectMamba is a novel Mamba-based architecture for medical image detection that uses Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention and Visual State-Space Module to overcome CNN and Transformer limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging abnormality detection requires both efficiency and accuracy. CNNs have limited receptive fields, while Transformers have prohibitive computational costs for high-resolution medical images. Mamba's linear complexity for long sequences offers a promising alternative.

Method: Proposed SpectMamba with Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block to separately learn high/low-frequency features, Visual State-Space Module (VSSM), and Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to enhance spatial correlations and global context capture.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various medical image detection tasks while being both effective and efficient.

Conclusion: SpectMamba successfully addresses CNN and Transformer limitations in medical imaging, providing an efficient and accurate solution for abnormality detection through innovative frequency-space modeling and optimized Mamba framework.

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: BSA framework uses bidirectional sparse attention to dramatically accelerate video DiT training by dynamically sparsifying both queries and key-value pairs, achieving up to 20x FLOPs reduction while maintaining generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion Transformer models face prohibitive computational costs due to quadratic complexity of full attention, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos, requiring more efficient attention mechanisms.

Method: Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework that dynamically sparsifies both queries (via semantic similarity selection) and key-value pairs (via statistical dynamic thresholding) within 3D full attention.

Result: BSA reduces FLOPs by up to 20x, achieves 17.79x faster attention training, and preserves or even surpasses the generative quality of full attention across long sequences.

Conclusion: BSA effectively addresses computational bottlenecks in video DiTs through dynamic bidirectional sparsification, enabling efficient high-quality video generation without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE is an end-to-end video pose estimation framework that uses spatio-temporal transformers to overcome limitations of traditional two-stage approaches, achieving better performance and 300% faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage video pose estimation methods separate spatial and temporal processing, lack global spatio-temporal context, and suffer from inefficient inference due to complex post-processing like RoI cropping and NMS.

Method: Proposes VEPE framework with three spatio-temporal Transformer components: STPE (encoder), STDME (memory encoder), and STPD (decoder). Includes instance consistency mechanism to improve cross-frame pose query matching and enable instance tracking.

Result: Outperforms most two-stage models on Posetrack dataset and improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: VEPE provides a simple, flexible end-to-end solution that effectively utilizes temporal context for video pose estimation while significantly boosting efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

TL;DR: PVINet is a point-voxel interlaced network for point cloud compression that processes global and local features in parallel with interactive communication, using conditional sparse convolution for enhanced feature extraction and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud compression methods process global and local information sequentially without adequate communication between them, limiting reconstruction quality that depends on both structural and contextual features.

Method: Proposes PVINet with parallel voxel-based encoder for global features and point-based encoder for local contexts. Introduces conditional sparse convolution to dynamically customize kernels using point embeddings, enabling feature interactions between encoders. Uses voxel-based decoder with conditional sparse convolution for guided reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show PVINet delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The parallel processing with interactive communication between global and local features through conditional sparse convolution effectively enhances point cloud compression performance.

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FICGen is a new layout-to-image generation method that addresses the contextual illusion dilemma in degraded scenes by transferring frequency knowledge to latent diffusion space, improving generative fidelity and layout alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout-to-image generation methods suffer from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with user layouts in degraded scenes (low-light, underwater) due to the contextual illusion dilemma where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions.

Method: Proposes Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative (FICGen) paradigm with: 1) learnable dual-query mechanism with frequency resamplers to extract contextual frequency prototypes, 2) visual-frequency enhanced attention to inject frequency prototypes, 3) instance coherence map for latent-space disentanglement, and 4) adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks across various degraded scenarios (severe low-light to mild blur) demonstrate FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in generative fidelity, alignment, and downstream auxiliary trainability.

Conclusion: FICGen effectively addresses the contextual illusion problem in degraded image generation by leveraging frequency knowledge transfer and contextual disentanglement, achieving superior performance across multiple degraded scenarios.

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken is a novel Gaussian parameterized spatially-adaptive tokenization framework that uses 2D Gaussians to dynamically model image regions with varying shapes, positions, and textures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional uniform grid tokenization methods are inflexible for representing regions with varying shapes and textures at different locations, limiting feature representation efficacy.

Method: Uses entropy-driven algorithm to partition images into texture-homogeneous regions, parameterizes each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) with texture features, and employs a specialized transformer to optimize Gaussian parameters with differentiable splatting-based renderer for decoding.

Result: Achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using only 128 tokens, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GPSToken enables efficient non-uniform image tokenization and two-stage generation (structural layout synthesis followed by texture generation), providing superior flexibility and performance compared to conventional grid-based approaches.

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

### [98] [MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01144)
*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL is a universal semi-supervised learning framework that improves medical image segmentation by assigning spatially heterogeneous weights to pixels based on uncertainty and consistency between predictions, addressing both unlabeled data quality and annotation noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods overlook noise in labeled data and ignore the heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. The authors argue that effectively mining information from both reference and supervised predictions is more essential than specific reference generation strategies.

Method: Proposes a spatially heterogeneous loss that splits predictions into four regions (UC, US, DC, DS) with decreasing weights based on uncertainty and consistency. Uses adaptive threshold to distinguish confident from suspicious predictions and applies the loss to both labeled and unlabeled data for robust learning.

Result: Experimental results showed significant improvement in segmentation performance when integrated with existing SSL frameworks across different datasets.

Conclusion: MetaSSL is a plug-and-play framework that effectively addresses annotation noise and unlabeled data heterogeneity, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art SSL methods for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is

*Taiga Yamane,Ryo Masumura,Satoshi Suzuki,Shota Orihashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTrajecter is a novel end-to-end multi-view pedestrian tracking method that uses multiple past timestamps from trajectories for robust association, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous end-to-end MVPT methods only use current and single adjacent past timestamp, discarding valuable information from longer past trajectories, which limits association accuracy.

Method: Proposes trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to incorporate motion and appearance information from multiple past timestamps, using attention mechanism to capture relationships between timestamps.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVTrajecter outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: Utilizing multiple past timestamps with trajectory-based costs and attention mechanism significantly improves multi-view pedestrian tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision encoders used in multimodal LLMs for video understanding fail to identify the most informative frames, limiting efficient video processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current vision-language encoders can truly identify the most informative frames for video understanding tasks in MLLMs, as this affects computational efficiency.

Method: Provided empirical evidence through analysis of popular vision encoders' capability to identify keyframes that MLLMs should focus on for given textual queries.

Result: Found that popular vision encoders critically suffer from limited capability to identify where MLLMs should look in videos to appropriately handle textual queries.

Conclusion: Development of better keyframe identification techniques is necessary for efficient video multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

### [101] [DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177)
*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind is a novel EEG-to-video reconstruction framework that jointly models neural dynamics and semantic features through three modules: Regional-aware Semantic Mapper, Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner, and Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in accuracy and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based video reconstruction methods struggle with low spatial resolution of EEG, temporal mismatches between neural recordings and video dynamics, and insufficient use of semantic information, leading to inadequate resolution of both dynamic coherence and complex semantic context.

Method: Three core modules: 1) Regional-aware Semantic Mapper extracts multimodal semantic features from EEG across brain regions into a unified diffusion prior; 2) Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner generates dynamic latent sequences for temporal consistency; 3) Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor translates temporal blueprint into high-fidelity video using semantic guidance.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on SEED-DV dataset: 12.5% and 10.3% improvements in video- and frame-based accuracies respectively, 9.4% SSIM improvement, and 19.7% FVMD reduction, demonstrating exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: DynaMind bridges the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics, marking a critical advancement in EEG-based video reconstruction by effectively addressing spatial resolution limitations, temporal mismatches, and semantic utilization challenges.

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDPO is a framework for multi-subject personalized image generation that uses adaptive focus regions based on semantic correspondence and image complexity to prevent attribute leakage while maintaining subject fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-subject personalized image generation faces challenges in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage without test-time optimization.

Method: Adaptively identifies focus regions using dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity, progressively adjusting focal areas across noise timesteps with a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches and penalizes low-confidence regions.

Result: Substantially enhances performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity, advancing controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegAssess is a novel DL framework that introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) for pixel-level segmentation quality assessment, achieving SOTA performance and excellent zero-shot transferability across 32 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised segmentation quality assessment methods suffer from coarse granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability, limiting their effectiveness in remote sensing applications.

Method: Formulates SQA as a four-class panoramic segmentation task (TP, FP, TN, FN) using enhanced SAM architecture with mask prompting, Edge Guided Compaction branch with Aggregated Semantic Filter, and Augmented Mixup Sampling training strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 32 datasets from 6 sources and demonstrates remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks.

Conclusion: SegAssess establishes PQM as a robust and transferable solution for comprehensive unsupervised segmentation quality assessment in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

TL;DR: PrediTree is the first open-source dataset for high-resolution tree height prediction, combining 0.5m LiDAR canopy height maps with multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery across French forests (3.1M+ images). A U-Net model trained on this dataset achieved 11.78% error, outperforming ResNet-50 by 12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations at sub-meter resolution.

Method: Proposes an encoder-decoder framework using multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and relative time differences between image acquisition dates and target canopy height timestamp. Uses U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset.

Result: U-Net architecture achieved masked mean squared error of 11.78%, outperforming ResNet-50 by around 12% and reducing error by around 30% compared to experiments using only RGB bands.

Conclusion: PrediTree dataset successfully enables accurate tree height prediction, with U-Net architecture showing best performance. The dataset and code are publicly available on HuggingFace and GitHub for broader research use.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same

*Tianwei Ye,Yong Ma,Xiaoguang Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch is an unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid multi-shape matching that uses shape graph attention and dual-level consistency to achieve better correspondences than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods learn canonical embeddings from single shapes, but there's a need to capture the underlying manifold structure of entire shape collections for more robust multi-shape matching.

Method: Uses shape graph attention network to capture manifold structure, constructs shared latent space with universe predictor, and enforces dual-level consistency through spatial/spectral domain alignment with cycle consistency loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching benchmarks.

Conclusion: DcMatch provides a more expressive and robust framework for non-rigid multi-shape matching through collective shape analysis and dual-level consistency enforcement.

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation in endoscopy using block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts to handle varying illumination and tissue features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variety of illumination conditions and scene features in endoscopic scenes poses challenges for generalizable depth estimation, which is crucial for low-cost 3D scene perception in minimally invasive procedures.

Method: Proposes a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts that adaptively selects different experts based on input features for weighted inference, and a self-supervised training framework to handle brightness and reflectance inconsistencies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets, and achieves best generalization through zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: The method contributes to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGG benchmarks have limited vocabulary, making open-vocabulary evaluation inefficient, and existing pre-training data is of poor quality.

Method: Develops a reference-free evaluation metric and uses region-specific prompt tuning of Vision-Language Models to generate high-quality synthetic training data.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that pre-training with the new synthetic data improves generalization capabilities of Open-Vocabulary SGG models.

Conclusion: The proposed metric enables fair evaluation of open-vocabulary capabilities, and the synthetic data generation method enhances model performance in scene graph generation tasks.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for correlating H&E morphology with IHC biomarker expression suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive sections, which compromises pathological interpretation of tumor spatial heterogeneity.

Method: A three-component framework: (1) Prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style decoupling, (2) GapBridge cyclic registration-synthesis that bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, and (3) Deformation-aware adversarial learning where generator and registration network jointly optimize a style-focused discriminator.

Conclusion: PRINTER provides a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining that advances computational pathology by enabling more accurate correlation between H&E morphology and IHC biomarker expression.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker

prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation is costly and time-consuming, while automatic labeling with existing models lacks accuracy in complex document formats like tables and formulas, limiting real-world performance of student models trained through distillation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate large-scale diverse synthetic data to train initial model, 2) Self-improvement through iterative annotation of real documents, quality filtering, and retraining on verified datasets.

Result: Trained POINTS-1.5 model achieves POINTS-Reader, which outperforms many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully creates high-quality document extraction capabilities without manual annotation or distillation, demonstrating superior performance through synthetic data generation and iterative self-improvement.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Motivation: Human-Scene Interaction faces challenges in handling long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes, requiring a solution that can generate realistic human behaviors in complex environments without paired training data.

Method: Models interaction as a dynamic directed graph with a collaborative multi-agent system: scene navigator for environmental perception and path planning, planning agent for goal decomposition, and critic agent for closed-loop feedback. Uses Direct Preference Optimization for action generation to enhance physical realism.

Result: Extensive experiments on SceneBench benchmark show FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism, reducing artifacts like limb distortion and foot-sliding.

Conclusion: FantasyHSI successfully addresses HSI limitations through its multi-agent framework and DPO training, demonstrating superior performance in generating realistic, logically consistent human behaviors across diverse scenes without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection architectures like RT-DETRv2 are difficult to understand, and existing diagrams fail to clarify how components actually work and fit together.

Method: The authors use a series of eight carefully designed illustrations to explain the architecture, moving from overall pipeline down to critical components like encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention.

Conclusion: This visual explanation approach makes the RT-DETRv2 architecture genuinely understandable for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often
more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important
advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

### [112] [Learning Correlation-aware Aleatoric Uncertainty for 3D Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01242)
*Lee Chae-Yeon,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes novel aleatoric uncertainty modeling for 3D hand pose estimation using a single linear layer to capture joint correlations, achieving better accuracy and uncertainty estimation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D hand pose estimation methods lack aleatoric uncertainty estimation and don't incorporate joint correlation knowledge, which is crucial for handling complex hand movements, self-similarity, and occlusions.

Method: Introduces a novel parameterization that formulates hand joint output space as probabilistic distribution, using a single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This can be applied as an add-on module to existing models.

Result: The proposed parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing approaches. The model achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while adding new uncertainty modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses limitations in current 3D hand pose estimation by incorporating aleatoric uncertainty modeling with joint correlation knowledge, providing a computationally efficient solution that improves both accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

### [113] [Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250)
*Xiangdong Zhang,Shaofeng Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-PQAE is a novel two-view cross-reconstruction method for point cloud self-supervised learning that outperforms single-view self-reconstruction approaches by generating decoupled views and reconstructing one from the other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on single-view masked point recovery. The authors recognize that two-view pre-training introduces greater diversity and variance, enabling more challenging and informative pre-training.

Method: Proposes Point-PQAE with a cross-reconstruction generative paradigm that generates two decoupled point cloud views and reconstructs one from the other. Introduces a crop mechanism for view generation and novel positional encoding for 3D relative position representation between views.

Result: Outperforms self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: Cross-reconstruction significantly increases pre-training difficulty compared to self-reconstruction, enabling superior performance in 3D self-supervised learning through two-view learning paradigm.

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is
available at https://github.com/aHapBean/Point-PQAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image captioning systems produce generic descriptions that fail to capture event-level semantics crucial for applications like news reporting and digital archiving, missing temporal, social, and historical contexts.

Method: Three integrated components: (1) two-stage article retrieval using DINOv2 embeddings with global feature similarity and patch-level mutual nearest neighbor re-ranking, (2) context extraction framework synthesizing article summaries, generic captions, and source metadata, (3) LLM-based caption generation with Semantic Gaussian Normalization.

Conclusion: ReCap effectively bridges visual perception with real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image understanding in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

### [115] [Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01275)
*Jiahao Li Yang Lu,Yachao Zhang,Fangyong Wang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Agent is a novel open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework that uses latent semantic-aware agents to optimize cross-modal attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance by enhancing latent semantic saliency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference in semantic segmentation, and overcome the underexplored mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension in vision-language models.

Method: Proposes X-Agent framework with latent semantic-aware agents that orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms to simultaneously optimize latent semantic dynamics and amplify perceptibility.

Result: Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing latent semantic saliency.

Conclusion: X-Agent successfully addresses the challenges in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by improving latent semantic comprehension through innovative agent-based cross-modal attention orchestration.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Method: Employ Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to systematically optimize YOLOv10's network structure, particularly focusing on backbone architecture search. Uses evolutionary search within an extensive search space to identify optimal architectures that balance accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost.

Result: The optimized model outperforms existing SAR detection methods on the large-scale SARDet-100K dataset, achieving superior detection accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: This work successfully introduces NAS to SAR object detection for the first time and demonstrates that NAS can effectively optimize existing detectors for SAR applications, offering a novel perspective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

*Zhiwei Lin,Weicheng Zheng,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient radar object detection model using multi-representation inputs with adapter branch, exchanger module, and neural architecture search for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors are robust against adverse lighting and weather conditions compared to cameras, making them valuable for reliable object detection in challenging environments.

Method: Multi-representation of RD radar maps (heatmaps + grayscale images), adapter branch, exchanger module, primary-auxiliary fusion module, and one-shot neural architecture search with supernet optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mAP@50 of 71.9 on RADDet and 57.1 on CARRADA datasets, demonstrating favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively combines multi-representation inputs with optimized architecture search to deliver efficient and high-performance radar-based object detection.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

### [118] [Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Ordinary Differential Equations over Time Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01299)
*Huan Ni,Qingshan Liu,Xiaonan Niu,Danfeng Hong,Lingli Zhao,Haiyan Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSS-TIs, an all-in-one module using ODEs and Fourier transform for cross-domain few-shot segmentation, replacing multiple independent modules with a unified approach that models domain relationships through iterative spectral transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CD-FSS methods use multiple independent modules that hinder knowledge flow and limit collective potential. The paper aims to create a more integrated approach for better cross-domain generalization in few-shot segmentation.

Method: Uses ordinary differential equations and Fourier transform to model relationships between domain-specific and domain-agnostic features. Applies iterative transformations with randomized perturbations to spectra, reformulating feature exploration as ODE optimization with constrained support-sample selection.

Result: Experimental results on five diverse datasets show FSS-TIs outperforms existing CD-FSS methods. Ablation studies confirm strong cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: FSS-TIs provides a structurally concise and effective solution for cross-domain few-shot segmentation by unifying feature transformation through ODE-based spectral processing, demonstrating superior performance over modular approaches.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

### [119] [Guided Model-based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Resource-Efficient Automotive scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01317)
*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end framework that jointly optimizes LiDAR super-resolution and semantic segmentation, achieving comparable performance to expensive 64-channel LiDAR using sparse 16-channel data with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution LiDAR is costly for autonomous driving, while low-cost 16-channel LiDAR produces sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. Need to bridge this performance gap affordably.

Method: Joint optimization framework with SR module incorporating semantic cues, new SR loss function focusing on regions of interest, and lightweight model-based architecture with fewer parameters.

Result: Achieves segmentation performance comparable to models using expensive 64-channel LiDAR data while using sparse 16-channel input.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully enables high-quality semantic segmentation using low-cost LiDAR sensors through joint super-resolution and segmentation optimization.

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

*Fuyou Mao,Beining Wu,Yanfeng Jiang,Han Xue,Yan Tang,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGRD is a diffusion-based framework for medical image segmentation that learns full conditional distributions using prior guidance and residual learning to improve calibration and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often has inherent ambiguity, requiring models that capture full conditional distributions rather than single point estimates to account for uncertainty.

Method: PGRD uses a diffusion-based approach that embeds discrete labels in continuous space, employs a coarse prior predictor for step-wise guidance, learns residuals to accelerate convergence, and uses deep diffusion supervision to stabilize training.

Result: PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines on MRI and CT datasets, while requiring fewer sampling steps.

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures voxel-wise distributions in medical image segmentation with improved calibration and practical sampling efficiency compared to existing probabilistic methods.

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal LLMs for geolocation estimation, offering an alternative to traditional training-from-scratch methods and enabling more accessible, scalable GeoAI solutions.

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense provides practical, scalable solution for real-time precision agriculture decision support and enables future lightweight multimodal AI systems for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable

not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32

*Che Liu,Zheng Jiang,Chengyu Fang,Heng Guo,Yan-Jie Zhou,Jiaqi Qu,Le Lu,Minfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret is a unified visual encoder that achieves state-of-the-art medical image retrieval across 2D, 3D, and video modalities without modality-specific customization, using self-supervised learning on a large hybrid dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image retrieval methods are fragmented with separate architectures for different modalities (2D, 3D, video), which hampers scalability and prevents unified representation learning.

Method: Created a large-scale hybrid dataset of 867,653 medical imaging samples (2D X-rays, ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, 3D CT scans) and trained M3Ret using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning paradigms without modality-specific customization.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all modalities, surpassing DINOv3 and BMC-CLIP. Demonstrated strong cross-modal alignment without paired data and generalization to unseen MRI tasks despite no MRI in pretraining.

Conclusion: M3Ret represents a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical imaging, showing that purely visual self-supervision can generalize to unseen modalities and deliver scalable unified representations.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

*Jiayi Gao,Changcheng Hua,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free framework (TPIGE) enhances text-to-video generation with identity preservation through prompt refinement, image enhancement, and spatiotemporal guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and high tuning costs in identity-preserving text-to-video generation by developing a training-free approach that bridges semantic gaps between text prompts and reference images.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Face Aware Prompt Enhancement using GPT-4o to add facial details, 2) Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement using identity-preserving generator, 3) ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement with unified gradients during generation.

Result: Outperforms prior work, wins first place in ACM Multimedia 2025 challenge, validated on 1000-video test set with both automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: TPIGE achieves state-of-the-art identity-preserving video generation with minimal cost, demonstrating strong performance and generality without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uirapuru is a framework for real-time video analytics on steerable cameras that adapts to camera movements through per-frame adaptive tiling, achieving significant accuracy and speed improvements over static camera approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-time video analytics systems focus on static viewpoint cameras, but steerable cameras with pan-tilt-zoom capabilities introduce scene dynamism that breaks traditional approaches like frame tiling.

Method: Uirapuru incorporates comprehensive camera actuation understanding into system design and uses fast adaptive tiling at per-frame level to handle the dynamism of steerable cameras.

Result: The framework provides up to 1.45x accuracy improvement while respecting latency budgets, or up to 4.53x inference speedup with comparable accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Conclusion: Uirapuru successfully addresses the challenges of real-time video analytics on steerable cameras by integrating camera actuation awareness with adaptive processing techniques.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light enhancement methods struggle with UAV aerial imagery challenges including ultra-high resolution, lack of paired data, non-uniform illumination, and deployment constraints for real-time applications.

Method: Develops U3LIE framework with two training-only designs: Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input normalization and Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. Introduces unsupervised UHR dataset U3D and Edge Efficiency Index metric.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust

### [128] [Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383)
*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAL framework introduces probabilistic modeling and confidence gates to address data uncertainty in partially relevant video retrieval, improving robustness against spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods are vulnerable to distractor videos due to query ambiguity and partial video relevance, which create spurious semantic correlations and contextual noise in cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) with: 1) probabilistic modeling encoding videos/queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions for uncertainty quantification, 2) learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity based on query word informativeness.

Result: RAL demonstrates effectiveness across diverse retrieval backbones as a plug-and-play solution, showing improved performance against distractor videos with spurious similarities.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach and dynamic confidence weighting effectively address data uncertainty challenges in PRVR, providing a robust solution that can be integrated into existing architectures.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

*Emmanouil Nikolakakis,Amine Ouasfi,Julie Digne,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RibPull uses neural occupancy fields to represent CT-scanned ribcages as continuous implicit 3D functions, enabling better handling of sparse/noisy data and allowing Laplacian-based medial axis extraction compared to traditional voxel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel grids in medical imaging suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and inefficient handling of sparsity. Implicit 3D representations using continuous functions can better handle sparse and noisy data while preserving complex geometrical information.

Method: Uses neural occupancy fields to predict whether 3D points lie inside/outside ribcage objects from CT scans. Applies Laplacian-based contraction to extract medial axis of ribcages, demonstrating advantages of continuous coordinate-based representations over voxel-based methods.

Result: Methodology evaluated on 20 medical scans from RibSeg dataset (extension of RibFrac dataset). Shows that continuous implicit representations enable effective medial axis extraction and handle sparse data better than discrete voxel methods.

Conclusion: Implicit occupancy fields provide superior representation for medical imaging tasks like ribcage analysis, offering continuous functions that compensate for sparse signals and enable complex geometrical operations like medial axis extraction more effectively than traditional voxel-based approaches.

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

*Jianman Lin,Tianshui Chen,Chunmei Qing,Zhijing Yang,Shuangping Huang,Yuheng Ren,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSD is a novel framework for photo-realistic image editing that maintains both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with surrounding environment using parallel cross-attention mechanisms and a progressive self-style learning module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods focus primarily on semantic control but neglect stylistic consistency, which is crucial for cohesive and aesthetically appealing images.

Method: Uses advanced diffusion model with two parallel cross-attention mechanisms for text and style processing, plus Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module with style contrastive loss to capture fine-grained style representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in maintaining stylistic consistency while achieving semantic control.

Conclusion: NSD successfully addresses the critical task of preserving stylistic consistency in image editing through its novel architecture and learning approach, establishing a new standard for this important capability.

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO is a lightweight perceptual metric for image quality assessment that outperforms existing metrics and serves as an effective perceptual loss for image optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient full-reference image quality assessment metric that doesn't require large human-labeled datasets and can also function as a perceptual loss for optimization tasks.

Method: Trained using pseudo-MOS supervision with reproducible distortions scored by an ensemble of quality metrics. Uses spatial masking and curriculum learning strategy for optimization in both image and latent domains.

Result: Outperforms existing metrics across standard benchmarks, enables efficient optimization for denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: MILO serves as both a state-of-the-art image quality metric and a practical tool for perceptual optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

TL;DR: A modified YOLOv8-based system for accurate calorie estimation of Bangladeshi street foods, achieving 96.0% R^2 score with low error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing automated calorie tracking systems that struggle with multiple food recognition, image scaling issues, and lack of focus on non-Western cuisines like Bangladeshi street food.

Method: Constructed a diverse Bangladeshi street food dataset, modified YOLOv8 for improved classification and segmentation, and integrated a machine learning regression model for calorie estimation.

Result: Achieved 6.94 MAE, 11.03 RMSE, and 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation with only slight computational complexity increase compared to base YOLOv8.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an effective and accurate solution for real-world calorie calculation of Bangladeshi street foods, addressing gaps in existing food recognition technologies.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoScale framework addresses resolution scaling issues in diffusion models through three modules: Progressive Frequency Compensation, Adaptive Information Aggregation, and Noise Adaptation to enable effective variable-scale image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer performance degradation when generating images at resolutions different from training scale due to information handling challenges across varying resolutions.

Method: Proposed InfoScale framework with three modules: 1) Progressive Frequency Compensation to address high-frequency loss from dilated convolution, 2) Adaptive Information Aggregation for flexible attention mechanisms, and 3) Noise Adaptation for proper initial noise distribution alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation as a plug-and-play solution for diffusion models.

Conclusion: InfoScale successfully addresses three critical information-related challenges in diffusion models for variable-scale generation, providing a comprehensive solution through information-centric design.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Motivation: Address the trade-off between CNNs (efficient but limited receptive fields) and ViTs (global context but quadratic computational cost) in facial attractiveness assessment tasks.

Method: Integrates a lightweight Mamba-inspired State Space Model gating mechanism into hierarchical convolutional backbone to dynamically modulate feature maps and emphasize salient facial features with long-range spatial relationships.

Conclusion: Validates synergistic potential of combining CNNs with selective SSMs, presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of publicly available datasets for sports video summarization, particularly for soccer highlight generation, to support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing manual effort.

Method: Curated a dataset using broadcast footage from SoccerNet with shot boundaries for 237 matches across Spanish, French, and Italian leagues. Proposed a baseline model specifically designed for soccer video summarization and introduced a new length-constrained evaluation metric.

Result: The baseline model achieved an F1 score of 0.3956 on the test set. The dataset serves as a benchmark for soccer video summarization tasks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the dataset gap in sports video summarization by providing a curated soccer dataset, baseline model, and improved evaluation metric, facilitating future research in automatic sports highlight generation.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Method: Analyzed latent activations, attention distributions, and patch uniformity in pretrained vision encoders. Explored sparse autoencoder loss over vision transformer representations as a memorability proxy.

Result: Found that model-internal features correlate with memorability to some extent. Sparse autoencoder loss on vision transformers outperformed past CNN-based methods for predicting memorability.

Conclusion: Some internal features of vision models are informative predictors of image memorability, shedding light on the relationship between model representations and human memory processes.

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel 3D hair reconstruction method combining synthetic and real data training with transformer-based prior and Gaussian splatting for single/multi-image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with reconstructing complete 3D hair geometry from single images due to hair complexity and lack of ground truth data. Synthetic data alone is limited in quantity and quality.

Method: Transformer-based prior model trained on synthetic data for internal geometry, combined with real data for outer structure modeling. Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction from one or more images.

Result: Superior performance in capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach using both synthetic and real data effectively addresses hair reconstruction challenges, producing realistic 3D hairstyles with complete internal structure.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between accuracy and speed in existing voxel-based (accurate but slow) and pillar-based (fast but less accurate) point cloud processing methods for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Converts 3D point clouds into multiple 2D (x-y) data slices and processes them as separate batches of 2D data. Includes a Slice Interaction Network (SIN) to maintain vertical relationships across slices within the 2D backbone network.

Result: Achieves high detection accuracy and inference speed: 1.13x faster with 0.79x fewer parameters than SAFDNet on Waymo (only 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction), 66.74 mAP on nuScenes (state-of-the-art), and 1.10x faster with 0.66x fewer parameters on Argoverse 2 (1.0 mAP reduction).

Conclusion: PointSlice effectively balances accuracy and speed in 3D object detection by transforming 3D point clouds into 2D slices while preserving 3D relationships through SIN, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D establishes a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation with efficient one- to two-step inference and high geometric fidelity.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSA2-Net introduces Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to dynamically adjust convolution kernel sizes based on dataset characteristics, improving medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet framework automatically tunes most hyperparameters but overlooks internal segmentation network hyperparameters, limiting model generalization capabilities.

Method: Developed Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts convolution kernel sizes. Integrated into Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge (to refine CSWin Transformer outputs) and Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder (to capture organ details).

Result: Achieved Dice coefficients: 86.49% (Synapse), 92.56% (ACDC), 93.37% (Kvasir), 92.98% (ISIC2017), demonstrating robust performance across diverse medical image datasets.

Conclusion: MSA2-Net with Self-Adaptive Convolution Module significantly improves medical image segmentation accuracy and generalization across various datasets by capturing both global and local features effectively.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image and long-video understanding in LVLMs results in substantial token counts, reducing inference efficiency. Existing token compression methods suffer from positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators.

Method: Proposes Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (V²Drop) which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, leveraging task-agnostic visual token variation properties.

Result: Maintains 94.0% of original performance for image understanding and 98.6% for video understanding while reducing LLM generation latency by 31.5% and 74.2% respectively. Further reduces GPU peak memory when combined with efficient operators.

Conclusion: V²Drop provides an effective token compression solution that addresses limitations of existing methods and significantly improves computational efficiency for LVLMs while preserving performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 7% AUROC improvement on CT-RATE benchmark compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label models. Demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization and unexpected zero-shot performance on RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation effectively enhances model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff is a deep learning approach using latent diffusion models to remove HIFU interference from ultrasound images in real-time, significantly outperforming traditional Notch Filter methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time monitoring of HIFU treatments is crucial for success and safety, but current ultrasound guidance suffers from interference that hinders accurate monitoring.

Method: Uses Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into latent space, followed by latent diffusion model to iteratively remove interference, then decodes to reconstruct clean images.

Result: Achieved SSIM of 0.796 and PSNR of 23.780 (vs 0.443 and 14.420 for Notch Filter) with real-time processing at 15 FPS (vs 5 seconds per frame for Notch Filter).

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff enables effective real-time denoising of HIFU interference in ultrasound guidance, potentially improving treatment precision in clinical HIFU applications.

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding remains challenging due to the dynamic, information-dense nature of videos and the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage in existing models.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Slow-Fast video encoding that dynamically allocates resources based on inter-frame similarity, 2) Progressive 4-stage pre-training extending context from 8K to 128K tokens, 3) Comprehensive post-training with chain-of-thought data, iterative GSPO-based RL, and alignment training.

Result: Significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5 successfully addresses fundamental video comprehension challenges through its innovative encoding strategy, extended context capability, and enhanced reasoning training pipeline.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Method: Proposes O-DisCo-Edit framework with object distortion control (O-DisCo) signal using random and adaptive noise to encapsulate various editing cues in a single representation. Includes a "copy-form" preservation module to maintain non-edited regions.

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit provides a unified solution for controllable video editing that outperforms existing methods while requiring fewer specialized control signals and training resources.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve catheterization procedures by enhancing tactile and visual perception through an end-to-end architecture that captures long-range dependencies in X-ray images from two viewpoints without needing gradual receptive field expansion.

Method: Encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences of patches. Uses shared segmentation heads for both encoder and decoder embeddings, and a regression head with fused decoder information for 3D force estimation.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and multitask approaches. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both catheter segmentation and force estimation across various noise levels in synthetic X-ray images.

Conclusion: The stereo Vision Transformer successfully addresses catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation simultaneously, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and establishing a new benchmark for both tasks in catheterization procedures.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of costly human-curated preference data, low-quality machine-generated data, and hallucination issues in self-supervised preference data for LVLM alignment.

Method: Propose Panel-of-Peers framework inspired by collaborative human learning, where a panel of LVLMs evaluate and learn from collective outputs through iterative self-improvement process simulating peer review.

Result: Significant improvement across multiple benchmarks, increasing average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to 57% without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets.

Conclusion: Peer evaluations serve as a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment, demonstrating the potential of collaborative learning among models to enhance performance.

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched is a post-training quantization method that modifies the diffusion scheduler instead of model weights, achieving 4x model size reduction while maintaining full-precision accuracy through quantization-aware scheduling adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally expensive, requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. Existing few-step methods still depend on large, uncompressed models that are too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs.

Method: Q-Sched modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights, adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory. It uses JAQ loss (combining text-image compatibility with image quality metric) to learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, requiring only a handful of calibration prompts without full-precision inference.

Result: Achieves 4x reduction in model size while maintaining full-precision accuracy. Shows 15.5% FID improvement over FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and 16.6% improvement over FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model. Large-scale user study with 80,000+ annotations confirms effectiveness on FLUX.1 and SDXL-Turbo.

Conclusion: Quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. Q-Sched provides an effective post-training quantization approach that avoids the need for full-precision calibration and delivers substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Conclusion: The lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models due to superior training efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

TL;DR: ReVPT enhances multi-modal LLMs' visual reasoning through reinforcement learning with visual tools, achieving state-of-the-art performance on perception-heavy benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual reasoning face limitations like expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. Augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning has key shortcomings that need addressing.

Method: Proposes ReVPT using reinforcement learning based on GRPO algorithm to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Uses RL to enhance multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated

TL;DR: Enhanced ConvNeXt model with self-attention and channel attention mechanisms for improved rock size classification accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rock size classification is vital for geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management as it influences operational efficiency and safety

Method: Proposed CNSCA model based on ConvNeXt architecture augmented with self-attention (for long-range spatial dependencies) and channel attention (to emphasize informative feature channels)

Result: The model demonstrated significantly enhanced classification accuracy and robustness compared to three strong baselines on rock size classification dataset

Conclusion: Incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly improves model capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage diffusion framework using clinical metadata for limited-angle CT reconstruction, achieving superior image quality with physics-based consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle CT suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections, requiring methods to address the ill-posed reconstruction problem while leveraging available clinical information.

Method: Two-stage transformer-based diffusion model: first stage generates coarse anatomical priors from metadata only, second stage refines with both metadata and coarse prior. Uses ADMM for physics-based data consistency at each sampling step.

Result: Significantly improves reconstruction fidelity under severe angular truncation. Outperforms metadata-free baselines in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC metrics. Different metadata types provide complementary benefits.

Conclusion: Clinical metadata plays a dual role in improving both reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) and Mixture of BIB (MBIB) methods for long-tailed visual recognition, integrating loss re-balancing and self-distillation into information bottleneck framework to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world visual recognition data is usually long-tailed, which challenges DNN training and deployment. Information bottleneck is effective for representation learning but needs adaptation for imbalanced data.

Method: BIB integrates loss function re-balancing and self-distillation into original IB network. MBIB extends this with multiple BIBs combining knowledge from different network layers, enabling end-to-end simultaneous representation and classification learning.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018 show both BIB and MBIB achieve state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed BIB and MBIB approaches effectively address long-tailed recognition by preserving essential label-related information through information bottleneck principles with re-balancing and multi-layer knowledge integration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PractiLight is a practical approach for controlling lighting in generated images by leveraging foundational generative models' understanding. It trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce irradiance maps and uses classifier guidance to incorporate desired lighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high generalization across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light control in generated images is challenging and most approaches require extensive domain-specific datasets, limiting generalization. The authors aim to develop a practical method that leverages foundational knowledge from recent generative models without needing large datasets.

Method: The method identifies that lighting relationships resemble token interactions in self-attention layers. It trains a lightweight LoRA regressor on a small image set to produce direct irradiance maps, then uses classifier guidance to incorporate desired lighting into image generation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in quality and lighting control with proven parameter and data efficiency across various scene types. The method generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains.

Conclusion: Image lighting can be effectively controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge of generative models, enabling practical and general relighting without extensive training data.

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGDiST is a reference-free latent gene diffusion model that addresses data dropout in spatial transcriptomics by using context genes to build a biologically meaningful latent space, outperforming previous methods by 18% in MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for predicting spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from data dropout limitations and dependency on external single-cell RNA sequencing references, risking batch effects and inherited dropout.

Method: LGDiST uses a diffusion model approach with context genes to create a rich genetic latent space, incorporating neighbor conditioning and eliminating the need for external references.

Result: LGDiST achieves 18% lower average MSE across 26 datasets and improves gene expression prediction performance by up to 10% on six state-of-the-art methods. Removing key components significantly reduces performance.

Conclusion: The full LGDiST architecture substantially outperforms its individual components, demonstrating that context genes and the ST latent space are crucial for effective gene expression completion in spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Motivation: Centralized training for object detection in CAVs lacks scalability, adaptability, and privacy preservation. Federated learning offers collaborative, privacy-preserving training but faces challenges in computational demands and environmental variability that need systematic evaluation for practical deployment.

Method: The study evaluates YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR detectors on KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes datasets. It analyzes detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage under diverse conditions including different resolutions, batch sizes, weather/lighting conditions, and dynamic client participation.

Result: The paper provides a holistic deployment-oriented evaluation that examines trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage across various environmental conditions and system configurations.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for robust FL deployment in CAVs by providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates model performance, system-level resource profiling, and environmental robustness assessment.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in computer vision enable non-contact water quality monitoring for disaster response and public health protection, providing a scalable alternative to traditional multispectral/hyperspectral methods.

Method: Developed HydroVision framework using transfer learning with four CNN architectures (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and Vision Transformer on 500,000+ seasonally varied RGB images from USGS.

Result: DenseNet121 achieved the best performance with R2 score of 0.89 for predicting Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), demonstrating effective water quality parameter estimation from RGB imagery.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for real-world water quality monitoring but requires future improvements for low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand operational utility.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on

TL;DR: Zero-shot framework using pre-trained vision language models for wildfire damage assessment from ground-level imagery, showing dramatic improvement with multi-view analysis compared to single-view approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage assessment methods are time-consuming and modern computer vision requires extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate post-disaster deployment. Need for rapid, accurate property damage assessment after wildfires.

Method: Proposed two zero-shot pipelines: VLM-only (Pipeline A) and VLM + LLM (Pipeline B) using structured prompts based on wildfire damage indicators. Applied to 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires in California with multi-view image analysis.

Result: Multi-view analysis dramatically improved classification (F1 scores 0.857-0.947) compared to single-view assessments (F1 scores 0.225-0.511). McNemar test confirmed statistical significance of multi-view improvements, but no significant difference between Pipeline A and B.

Conclusion: VLMs effectively synthesize multi-perspective information for nuanced damage identification. Framework provides immediately deployable, flexible workflow without supervised training, accelerating disaster response triage and prioritization.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response

*Zhipeng Weng,Xiaopeng Liu,Ce Liu,Xingyuan Guo,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gaussian quantization representation learning for diffusion models to reduce overfitting in few-shot drone infrared image super-resolution tasks, with a monitoring mechanism and new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale diffusion models for super-resolution suffer from severe overfitting when trained on few-shot drone-captured infrared data, undermining generalization ability.

Method: Gaussian quantization representation learning approach for diffusion models with an overfitting monitoring mechanism during training, tested on a new multi-source drone infrared benchmark dataset.

Result: Outperforms existing super-resolution methods and significantly mitigates overfitting of large-scale architectures under complex few-sample conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity, providing a robust solution for few-shot drone image reconstruction scenarios.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Motivation: Existing remote sensing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic disaster impacts over time.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark dataset with 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs covering various disasters (earthquakes, floods, wildfires) paired with human-like change captions.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges temporal and semantic gaps in remote sensing data, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in disaster monitoring.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,

*Furong Jia,Lanxin Liu,Ce Hou,Fan Zhang,Xinyan Liu,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates concept bottlenecks with geo-localization to improve both accuracy and interpretability by aligning image and location embeddings with geographic concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-localization models lack interpretability, and existing concept-based methods don't align well with geo-alignment objectives, leading to suboptimal performance and limited understanding of geographic decision-making.

Method: Proposes a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (climate, landmarks, architecture) and minimizes concept-level loss to enhance alignment in concept-specific subspaces.

Result: The approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and improves performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks while providing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making.

Conclusion: This is the first work to successfully introduce interpretability into geo-localization, demonstrating that concept-aware alignment enhances both model performance and understanding of geographic feature importance.

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

*Hiroshi Sasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel training paradigm using hard samples and specialized loss functions to improve diagram understanding in vision-language models like CLIP, showing significant improvements on flowchart benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multimodal models like CLIP struggle with specialized visual domains like diagrams that contain structured, symbolic information distinct from natural imagery.

Method: Proposed contrastive learning approach with two specialized loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams, using hard samples for training.

Result: Substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning on both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks using flowchart benchmarks.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are crucial for specialized tasks, and this approach advances diagrammatic understanding within vision-language integration.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

*Hongyu Li,Chaofeng Chen,Xiaoming Li,Guangming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First image inpainting framework using 2D Gaussian Splatting that encodes incomplete images into continuous Gaussian coefficients and reconstructs via differentiable rasterization, achieving competitive performance with improved coherence and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of Gaussian Splatting for image inpainting, which requires both local pixel coherence and global semantic restoration, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Encodes incomplete images into continuous 2D Gaussian splat coefficients, uses differentiable rasterization with patch-wise strategy for efficiency, and incorporates DINO features for global semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, demonstrating effective local coherence and global consistency.

Conclusion: Establishes a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing, showing promising results for image inpainting with inherent pixel-level coherence and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

*Therese Joseph,Tobias Fischer,Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event camera ensemble VPR method combining multiple reconstructions, feature extractors, and temporal resolutions achieves 57% Recall@1 improvement in day-night transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency but robust visual place recognition under severe illumination changes remains challenging.

Method: Ensemble-based approach combining sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions with broader fusion strategy.

Result: 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions on long-term driving datasets (8km per traverse) without metric subsampling.

Conclusion: The ensemble fusion strategy significantly improves robustness under varied lighting conditions, with comprehensive analysis identifying critical components for performance.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

*Dong She,Siming Fu,Mushui Liu,Qiaoqiao Jin,Hualiang Wang,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a framework for multi-subject image generation that uses semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement to maintain identity fidelity and prevent attribute leakage when generating images from multiple reference subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject generation methods suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces.

Method: Proposes semantic correspondence attention loss for precise point-to-point semantic alignment, and multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces. Uses SemAlign-MS dataset with fine-grained semantic correspondences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, maintaining high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects where existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects.

Conclusion: MOSAIC enables complex multi-subject synthesis applications by ensuring precise semantic alignment and preventing feature interference through orthogonal disentanglement.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VARIN is the first noise inversion-based editing method for Visual Autoregressive models that enables precise text-guided image editing without additional training, using a novel Location-aware Argmax Inversion technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VAR models show strong text-to-image generation capabilities, their ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without extra training remains unexplored but critical for practical applications.

Method: Introduces VARIN with Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI) to generate inverse Gumbel noises, enabling precise image reconstruction and targeted edits aligned with textual prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show VARIN effectively modifies source images according to text prompts while preserving original background and structural details.

Conclusion: VARIN validates the efficacy of noise inversion-based editing for VAR models as a practical approach for text-guided image editing.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIM addresses imbalanced responsibilities in multimodal models by creating a dataset with explicit design blueprints for image editing, achieving SOTA performance with a smaller model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models struggle with precise image editing due to imbalanced division of responsibilities - understanding modules act as translators while generation modules must handle both design and painting tasks.

Method: Created Draw-In-Mind (DIM) dataset with two subsets: DIM-T2I (14M image-text pairs) and DIM-Edit (233K chain-of-thought imaginations). Connected frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via lightweight MLP and trained on DIM dataset.

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming larger models like UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit.

Conclusion: Explicitly assigning design responsibility to the understanding module significantly benefits image editing performance, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter is a novel method that conditions text-to-image diffusion models on user-specified color palettes using histogram interpretation and control parameters for flexible palette adherence and color variation control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color palettes are widely used in creative workflows but introduce ambiguity and instability when conditioning image generation, requiring a more robust approach to ensure palette adherence while maintaining image quality.

Method: Interprets palettes as sparse histograms with two scalar control parameters (histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance), introduces negative histogram mechanism to suppress undesired hues, and trains on a carefully curated dataset with balanced color coverage.

Result: The method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across various palettes and prompts, outperforming existing approaches in both palette adherence and image quality as shown through qualitative, quantitative, and user study evaluations.

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter provides an effective solution for color palette conditioning in text-to-image generation, offering flexible control over palette adherence while maintaining high image quality and semantic coherence.

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vision-based system using quantized MobileNet on Raspberry Pi for automated, non-invasive monitoring of preterm infants' behavioral states (sleep/awake/crying) with high accuracy and edge deployment capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, especially in low-resource settings with limited NICU access. Current monitoring methods rely on manual observation or invasive sensors that are error-prone, impractical, and can cause skin damage.

Method: Developed an embedded monitoring system using quantized MobileNet model deployed on Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. The framework includes model quantization for memory efficiency, Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT communication for clinical alerts.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy: 91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for crying/normal classification. Model quantization reduced size by 68% while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment. Comparative analysis showed larger architectures offer marginal accuracy gains but are computationally prohibitive for real-time edge use.

Conclusion: Lightweight, optimized models like MobileNet provide the most viable foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring systems, enabling improved preterm care in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Result: The technique significantly improves the discriminative power of learned representations and shows performance improvements for both DeiT-S and Swin-T transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Simple yet effective integration of synthetic hard negatives can notably enhance vision transformer representation learning in self-supervised settings.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the
neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of

*Halima Bouzidi,Haoyu Liu,Mohammad Al Faruque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEIL adversarial framework exposes vulnerabilities in Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) systems, compromising both linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components through persistent spatial-temporal reasoning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RMOT systems that use natural-language queries for selective object tracking, their reliability and robustness remain underexplored from a security perspective, particularly regarding adversarial vulnerabilities.

Method: VEIL adversarial framework targets RMOT systems by crafting digital and physical perturbations that disrupt unified referring-matching mechanisms, exploiting vulnerabilities in spatial-temporal reasoning and FIFO-based memory systems.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on Refer-KITTI dataset show VEIL successfully corrupts tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations, with persistent errors in history buffers over multiple frames.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates critical security vulnerabilities in RMOT systems and highlights the urgent need for security-aware designs in large-scale applications to ensure reliable object tracking.

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

*Nikolaos Giakoumoglou,Andreas Floros,Kleanthis Marios Papadopoulos,Tania Stathaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syn2Co framework explores using synthetic data and generated hard negatives to enhance self-supervised learning in vision transformers, reducing reliance on large real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of contrastive self-supervised learning that requires vast real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives, by exploring synthetic alternatives.

Method: Combines two approaches: 1) using generative models to create synthetic data for sample diversity, and 2) generating synthetic hard negatives in representation space for challenging contrasts. Evaluated on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.

Result: The framework demonstrates both promise and limitations of using synthetic data in self-supervised learning, providing insights into synthetic-enhanced training for robust visual representations.

Conclusion: Synthetic data shows potential for enhancing self-supervised learning but has limitations, offering valuable directions for future research in reducing dependency on large real datasets.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextFusion and Bootstrap Branch to enhance slot attention models by incorporating semantic information and enabling flexible feature adaptation, addressing limitations in current object-centric learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods lack high-level semantic information and cannot fine-tune encoders, limiting their ability to understand object contours, shapes, and semantic characteristics while restricting flexibility in object-centric learning.

Method: Introduces ContextFusion stage to exploit semantic information from foreground/background with auxiliary indicators, and Bootstrap Branch to decouple feature adaptation from reconstruction using bootstrap strategy for flexible feature adaptation.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance improvements on different state-of-the-art slot attention models across both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ContextFusion and Bootstrap Branch effectively address key limitations in slot attention methods, enhancing semantic understanding and flexibility while being seamlessly integrable into existing models.

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Data-centric approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images for augmenting underrepresented attributes in Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, improving both targeted and overall performance without model architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAR methods are constrained by dataset limitations, particularly under-representation of certain attributes, which affects recognition performance and generalization.

Method: 1) Protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes, 2) Prompt-driven pipeline using diffusion models to generate synthetic images while maintaining dataset consistency, 3) Strategy to incorporate synthetic samples with prompt-based annotation rules and modified loss function.

Result: Improved recognition of underrepresented attributes and overall model performance on popular PAR datasets, with enhanced zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient and scalable solution to improve pedestrian attribute recognition in real-world scenarios without requiring architectural modifications to existing models.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD is a semantics-aware discriminative method that significantly improves logical anomaly detection by explicitly modeling object composition maps, achieving 96.1% AUROC on MVTec LOCO benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface anomaly detection methods perform well on structural anomalies like dents and scratches but struggle with logical anomalies involving irregular or missing object components. Existing approaches discard spatial and semantic information through aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors.

Method: Proposes SALAD with a novel composition branch to explicitly model object composition map distributions, learning important semantic relationships. Introduces a new procedure for extracting composition maps without hand-made labels or category-specific information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec LOCO benchmark with 96.1% image-level AUROC, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: SALAD effectively addresses logical anomaly detection by preserving semantic and spatial information through composition map modeling, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOOUGAT is a unified multi-object tracker that bridges online and offline MOT by using a GNN framework with autoregressive layers to handle arbitrary temporal horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT approaches are fragmented into online (frame-by-frame) and offline (batch processing) methods, neither handling flexible temporal requirements or long-term occlusions effectively.

Method: Uses a Graph Neural Network framework that processes non-overlapping subclips with a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer, where subclip size controls latency vs context trade-off.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: +2.3 AssA on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, +5.0 on MOT20 in online mode, with even greater gains in offline mode.

Conclusion: NOOUGAT provides the first unified solution for arbitrary temporal horizons in MOT, outperforming both traditional online and offline trackers across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively segments hair artifacts in dermoscopic images, showing potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based data expansion is effective for generating PAR-like images and can enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios through synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

TL;DR: CFpano is the first benchmark dataset for cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in 360° scenes, featuring 2700+ images and 8000+ QA pairs. The authors also propose a multi-modal LLM fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional scene understanding is crucial for applications like embodied AI and autonomous driving, but existing methods only work within single frames and neglect cross-frame correlated panoramas.

Method: Created CFpano benchmark dataset with 2700+ images and 8000+ QA pairs. Developed a multi-modal LLM fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and tailored reward functions for cross-frame panoramic reasoning.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines by +5.37% in overall performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks.

Conclusion: CFpano establishes a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding, and the GRPO-based approach demonstrates effectiveness for robust reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene

TL;DR: RocketScience is a new benchmark that tests spatial relation understanding in VLMs, showing current models struggle with spatial reasoning while humans excel, with performance bottlenecked by spatial reasoning rather than object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that specifically tests spatial relation understanding in vision-language models, as current VLMs show deficiencies in this area despite good performance on other tasks.

Method: Developed a new benchmark with real-world image-text pairs focusing on relative spatial understanding and object order. Tested various open-source and commercial VLMs, performed disentanglement analysis to separate object localization from spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Current VLMs show striking lack of spatial relation understanding, with humans performing well but models struggling. Reasoning models performed surprisingly well. Analysis revealed performance is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning rather than object localization.

Conclusion: Spatial relation understanding remains a significant challenge for current VLMs, and the RocketScience benchmark provides a valuable tool for evaluating and improving this capability in future models.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new tracklet-based dataset called ITD for test-time adaptation benchmarking that captures real-world temporal dependencies, with experimental analysis showing current TTA methods' limitations and a proposed adversarial memory initialization strategy that improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA benchmarks fail to represent realistic scenarios with temporal dependencies, such as video streams where consecutive frames show the same object over time, which is common in real-world applications like hand-held cameras and self-driving cars.

Method: Created the ITD dataset using tracklets (sequences of object-centric images) from object-tracking dataset bounding boxes to naturally embody temporal dependencies. Conducted experimental analysis of TTA methods and proposed an adversarial memory initialization strategy for memory-based TTA methods.

Result: The ITD benchmark revealed limitations of current TTA methods when facing temporal dependencies. The proposed adversarial memory initialization strategy substantially boosted the performance of various methods on this challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: The ITD dataset provides a more realistic benchmark for TTA methods by incorporating temporal dependencies, and the adversarial memory initialization strategy effectively addresses the challenges posed by these dependencies in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

TL;DR: DSGC-Net is a dual-stream graph convolutional network that addresses crowd counting challenges by modeling density and representation correlations through two semantic graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd counting models struggle with significant density distribution differences between regions and inconsistent individual representations caused by viewpoint changes and body posture variations, which limit counting accuracy in complex crowd scenarios.

Method: Proposes DSGC-Net with two branches: Density Approximation (DA) branch with density prediction module and density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity, and Representation Approximation (RA) branch with representation-driven semantic graph based on global representation similarity. Uses graph convolutional networks on both semantic graphs to model latent semantic relationships.

Result: Achieves MAE of 48.9 on ShanghaiTech Part A and 5.9 on ShanghaiTech Part B datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods on three widely used datasets.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net effectively enhances model adaptation to density variations and improves counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios through dual-stream graph convolutional network architecture with feature correlation mining.

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

*Yingrui Ji,Jiansheng Chen,Jingbo Chen,Anzhi Yue,Chenhao Wang,Kai Li,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-OOD is a novel framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection in remote sensing imagery that uses vision-language modeling with spatial feature enhancement, dual-prompt alignment, and confidence-guided self-training to achieve superior performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods are poorly suited for remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts, creating a critical need for specialized solutions in applications like autonomous monitoring and disaster response.

Method: Leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling with three innovations: spatial feature enhancement for scene discrimination, dual-prompt alignment mechanism for spatial-semantic consistency verification, and confidence-guided self-training loop for pseudo-label mining without manual annotation.

Result: RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the critical value of spatial-semantic integration for robust OOD detection in remote sensing applications, providing an effective solution that works with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

*Pushpendra Dhakara,Prachi Chachodhia,Vaibhav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynthGenNet is a self-supervised student-teacher architecture that enables robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source imagery for urban scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured urban environments present challenges for scene understanding due to complex layouts, requiring models that can generalize across domains without labeled target data.

Method: Uses ClassMix++ algorithm for blending labeled synthetic data, Grounded Mask Consistency Loss for cross-domain alignment, and Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning for domain-invariant feature learning through teacher-student knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves 50% mIoU on real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), outperforming state-of-the-art single-source approaches.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the sim-to-real domain gap, improves prediction accuracy, and reduces reliance on labeled target data in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

*Sapir Esther Yiflach,Yuval Atzmon,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learn-to-Steer framework learns spatial relationship objectives from diffusion model's internal representations instead of using handcrafted losses, improving spatial accuracy dramatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models fail at basic spatial reasoning tasks like object placement, and existing methods use suboptimal handcrafted losses for spatial control.

Method: Trains lightweight classifier to decode spatial relationships from cross-attention maps, then uses it as learned loss function during inference with dual-inversion strategy to prevent linguistic shortcuts.

Result: Dramatic improvement in spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks, with generalization to multiple relations.

Conclusion: Learning spatial objectives directly from model's internal representations through data-driven approach significantly outperforms handcrafted methods for spatial control in diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using board games to evaluate AI models, specifically testing CLIP's color perception and naming through Hues & Cues game, revealing cultural biases and abstraction inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Games challenge human characteristics but are often overlooked in AI evaluation. Need new approaches to assess human-like nature of artificial models beyond standard benchmarks.

Method: Test CLIP's color perception and naming capabilities by playing the board game Hues & Cues, comparing its performance with human observers.

Result: CLIP is generally well-aligned with humans but shows cultural biases and inconsistencies at different abstraction levels that are hard to detect with traditional testing methods.

Conclusion: Board games and similar tasks can effectively reveal model deficiencies that standard benchmarks miss, providing valuable insights into AI-human alignment and cultural biases.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

*Longrong Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Yufeng Zhong,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Lei Chen,Haibo Qiu,Zequn Qin,Lin Ma,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniActor is a generalist agent that bridges GUI and embodied environments using a Layer-heterogeneity MoE architecture inspired by human brain mechanisms, achieving superior performance by leveraging synergy while eliminating data conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents focus on either GUI (2D virtual) or embodied (3D real) environments separately, but complex tasks require interleaved interaction with both types of environments. Mixing GUI and embodied data causes performance degeneration due to data conflicts.

Method: Proposed Layer-heterogeneity MoE architecture that separates deep-layer parameters to eliminate conflict between GUI and embodied data while sharing shallow-layer parameters to leverage their synergy. Also unified action spaces and collected large-scale multimodal data from various sources.

Result: OmniActor outperforms agents trained only on GUI or embodied data in both GUI and embodied tasks. The approach significantly improves performance across different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks.

Conclusion: The cerebrum-cerebellum inspired architecture successfully addresses data conflicts while leveraging synergies between GUI and embodied environments, enabling effective generalist agents capable of interleaved interaction across 2D virtual and 3D real worlds.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

### [197] [Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351)
*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORDAC is a novel method for detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification using adaptive label distribution learning to improve model robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in ordinal classification tasks (where class boundaries are ambiguous) significantly degrades model performance, and existing approaches often discard noisy samples rather than correcting them.

Method: Proposes ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) that uses Label Distribution Learning to dynamically adjust mean and standard deviation of label distributions for each sample during training, correcting noisy labels instead of discarding them.

Result: Significant improvements on benchmark datasets - on Adience with 40% noise: MAE reduced from 0.86 to 0.62, recall increased from 0.37 to 0.49. Also effective for correcting intrinsic noise in original datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in noisy data scenarios.

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes C33D method for 3D object synthesis by compositing 3D models with different object categories using multi-view diffusion techniques to ensure texture consistency and shape accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate multiple content sources, resulting in inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes when creating novel 3D models.

Method: Uses category+3D-to-3D (C33D) approach with multi-view rendering, adaptive text-image harmony for novel 2D object generation, texture multi-view diffusion for consistency, and shape multi-view diffusion for accuracy before 3D reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness, yielding impressive 3D creations like shark(3D)-crocodile(text) combinations with coherent structures and consistent textures.

Conclusion: The proposed C33D method successfully addresses the challenges of 3D object synthesis by effectively integrating multiple content sources while maintaining texture consistency and shape accuracy in novel 3D model generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

*Wanyue Zhang,Yibin Huang,Yangbin Xu,JingJing Huang,Helu Zhi,Shuo Ren,Wang Xu,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with spatial understanding despite recent progress. This paper systematically analyzes spatial capabilities across single-view, multi-view, and video scenarios using the MulSeT benchmark, finding data scaling alone is insufficient and architectural improvements are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack comprehensive spatial understanding evaluation, with studies limited to isolated scenarios. There's a need for systematic analysis to understand limitations and guide improvements for embodied AI applications.

Method: Proposed MulSeT benchmark for multi-view spatial understanding tasks. Conducted systematic analysis from data and architectural perspectives across three scenarios. Examined training data scaling effects and positional encoding importance in visual vs language components.

Result: Performance converges quickly with more training data but upper bound remains low, especially for spatial imagination tasks. Spatial understanding relies more on visual encoder's positional encoding than language model's in both cascaded and native MLLMs.

Conclusion: Merely expanding training data is insufficient for spatial understanding. Architectural improvements, particularly in visual encoders and reasoning injection, are crucial for advancing MLLM spatial capabilities in embodied environments.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3 adapts DINOv3 foundation model for medical image segmentation by addressing domain gap issues and outperforms specialized CNNs on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for medical image segmentation lack generalizability across modalities and institutions, and vision foundation models underperform specialized CNNs due to domain gap between natural and medical images.

Method: Designs a simple ViT architecture with multi-scale token aggregation, performs domain-adaptive pretraining on 3.87M CT slices using multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating foundation models can serve as unified backbones for medical segmentation.

Conclusion: MedDINOv3 successfully bridges the domain gap and shows vision foundation models have strong potential as general-purpose backbones for medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

TL;DR: DBStereo is a real-time stereo matching method that uses pure 2D convolutions for 4D cost aggregation instead of 3D regularization, achieving both fast performance and high accuracy while being mobile-friendly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-performance stereo matching methods rely on 3D regularization which is unsuitable for mobile devices, while 2D regularization methods perform poorly in ill-posed regions. There's a need for a deployment-friendly approach that maintains accuracy.

Method: The authors propose DBStereo with a lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block that captures spatial and disparity representations separately through decoupled learning of 4D cost volume characteristics using pure 2D convolutions.

Result: DBStereo outperforms all existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo, while achieving real-time performance.

Conclusion: This work breaks the traditional design paradigm of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a simple yet strong baseline for decoupled aggregation that enables mobile-friendly stereo matching with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

TL;DR: GSD-Net is a novel network that integrates geometric and structural guidance to improve medical image segmentation robustness against noisy annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation relies on costly expert annotations that inevitably contain noise from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupts feature learning and model performance.

Method: Proposes Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net) with three modules: Geometric Distance-Aware module for dynamic pixel-level weighting, Structure-Guided Label Refinement module using structural priors, and Knowledge Transfer module for enriched supervision.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six public datasets.

Conclusion: GSD-Net effectively addresses annotation noise in medical image segmentation by integrating geometric and structural guidance, providing robust performance against various types of label noise and real-world inconsistencies.

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reinforcement learning-driven framework for infrared and visible image fusion that combines collaborative distillation and self-learning to enhance student model performance with challenging samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models by improving knowledge transfer from teacher to student models while enabling self-learning on difficult samples.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning framework where an agent identifies optimal training strategies, generates challenging samples for student self-learning, and dynamically adjusts teacher guidance strength based on student performance and teacher-student gap.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in student performance and better fusion results compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative distillation and self-learning framework driven by reinforcement learning effectively enhances image fusion quality and student model capabilities.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: A real-time virtual makeup try-on framework that separates makeup transfer into extraction and rendering steps, achieving high-fidelity results with temporal consistency and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing makeup transfer methods struggle with disentangling cosmetics from skin tones, causing identity shifts and lacking real-time capabilities with temporal consistency.

Method: Decouples makeup transfer into transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based rendering. Uses pseudo-ground-truth from graphics rendering and k-means clustering, with specialized training objectives for transparency and color fidelity.

Result: Achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Outperforms existing baselines in detail capture, temporal stability, and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables real-time, high-fidelity virtual makeup try-on with improved identity preservation and temporal consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

TL;DR: RiverScope is a high-resolution dataset for river and surface water monitoring, featuring expert-labeled masks and co-registration with multiple satellite sensors, enabling improved river width estimation and multi-sensor hydrological modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data, which is critical for climate systems, ecosystems, agriculture, and disaster resilience.

Method: Developed RiverScope dataset with 1,145 high-resolution images covering 2,577 sq km, manually annotated with expert-labeled river and surface water masks. Co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and SWORD. Evaluated deep networks across multiple architectures, pretraining strategies, and training datasets.

Result: Achieved median error of 7.2 meters for river width estimation, significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. Best-performing models combine transfer learning benefits with multispectral PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors.

Conclusion: RiverScope provides a valuable resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management through improved high-resolution water monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models

TL;DR: Automated video compositing using Diffusion Transformers to inject foreground identity and motion into target videos with user control over size, trajectory, and attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video compositing requires intensive labor and expert collaboration, leading to long production cycles and high costs. The paper aims to automate this process using generative models.

Method: Developed a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline with background preservation branch using masked token injection, DiT fusion block with full self-attention, foreground augmentation, and Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE) for layout fusion. Trained on curated VideoComp dataset of 61K video sets.

Result: The method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing solutions in both fidelity and consistency metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed generative video compositing approach successfully automates the traditionally labor-intensive process, enabling adaptive injection of foreground elements with user customization while maintaining video consistency.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of previous SDS-based models and large 3D generative models for text-to-avatar generation, which suffer from slow iterative optimization processes.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Distill a decoder to create structured latent space from large human reconstruction model, 2) Train text-controlled latent diffusion model to generate 3D avatars within this latent space.

Result: Superior performance over previous text-to-avatar generative models in both subjective and objective evaluations, with enhanced efficiency and photorealistic results.

Conclusion: TeRA provides a more efficient and effective framework for text-to-3D-avatar generation, enabling text-based partial customization through structured 3D human representation without slow iterative optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

### [208] [Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488)
*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE) to address limitations of existing positional encodings in medical imaging, showing superior performance in anisotropic settings across multiple medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard positional encodings (SPEs and IFPEs) are suboptimal for medical imaging due to challenges with complex anatomical shapes and anisotropic nature of high-dimensional medical images. SPEs struggle with Euclidean distance preservation in higher dimensions, while IFPEs cannot handle anisotropy.

Method: Proposed AFPE - a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and domain-specific spatial dependencies. Systematically benchmarked against common PEs on multi-label chest X-ray classification, CT organ classification, and echocardiography ejection fraction regression.

Result: Choosing correct PE significantly improves model performance. Optimal PE depends on structure shape and data anisotropy. AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested anisotropic settings.

Conclusion: In anisotropic medical images and videos, it is crucial to choose an anisotropic PE that fits both the data characteristics and the shape of the anatomical structure of interest.

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

TL;DR: Lightweight framework combining 2D CNNs and LSTM with spatial attention for real-time fitness movement recognition, achieving 93.34% accuracy on UCF101 subset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for fitness activity recognition rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting real-time feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Integrates pre-trained 2D CNNs (ResNet50, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) with LSTM network enhanced by spatial attention mechanism to extract spatial features and capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieved peak accuracy of 93.34% with ResNet50-based configuration on UCF101 dataset subset, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art HAR systems.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

### [210] [Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02541)
*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel mix-modal federated learning framework (MDM-MixMFL) for MRI segmentation that handles distributed clients with diverse mixed modalities through modality decoupling and memorizing mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized multimodal MRI segmentation methods are inapplicable to real-world distributed medical scenarios where each hospital/client has diverse mixed MRI modalities with extensive heterogeneity in both modalities and data.

Method: MDM-MixMFL framework with modality decoupling strategy (separating modality-tailored and modality-shared information) and modality memorizing mechanism (storing client-shared modality prototypes) to handle heterogeneous data and incomplete modalities across distributed clients.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for mix-modal federated learning in MRI image segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed MDM-MixMFL framework successfully addresses the challenges of non-centralized mix-modal MRI segmentation through innovative modality decoupling and memorizing techniques, providing a practical solution for distributed medical scenarios with heterogeneous data and modalities.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

### [211] [Motion-Refined DINOSAUR for Unsupervised Multi-Object Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02545)
*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR is a fully unsupervised multi-object discovery method that extends DINOSAUR with motion cues and pseudo labels from optical flow segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised multi-object discovery approaches still rely on supervision for pseudo labels to train object-centric learning models, creating a limitation that needs to be addressed with truly unsupervised methods.

Method: Extends self-supervised DINOSAUR model by generating unsupervised pseudo labels from video frames without camera motion, performs motion segmentation of optical flow, refines slot representations, and trains a slot deactivation module for foreground/background assignment.

Result: Achieves strong multi-object discovery performance on TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR demonstrates that minimalistic unsupervised approaches can effectively perform multi-object discovery by leveraging motion cues and self-supervised pre-training, eliminating the need for human supervision in generating pseudo labels.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

TL;DR: FastVGGT introduces token merging to accelerate VGGT, achieving 4x speedup with 1000 images while maintaining reconstruction quality in 3D vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3D foundation models to long-sequence image inputs is challenging due to inference-time inefficiency, and existing token merging techniques don't work well for 3D architectures.

Method: Proposes FastVGGT with a training-free token merging mechanism and unique token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures, eliminating redundant computation while preserving reconstruction capacity.

Result: Achieves 4x speedup over VGGT with 1000 input images while mitigating error accumulation in long-sequence scenarios, validated on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks.

Conclusion: Token merging is a principled solution for scalable 3D vision systems, effectively addressing inference inefficiency in feed-forward visual geometry models.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.
