To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan\nAnimal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated\nmulti-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based\nvideo with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial\nmetrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,\ntracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,\nincluding time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat\nassociations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,\ndrone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,\nreducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher\naccuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,\nanalyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional\nmethods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,\nvigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains\nzebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit\nstrong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and\nobserved spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and\ngiraffes in mixed-species herds.
