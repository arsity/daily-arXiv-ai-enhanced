*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a standalone autoregressive model for high-quality image generation, outperforming diffusion models like DALL-E 3 and SANA, with multi-task capabilities and efficient decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revitalize autoregressive models for image generation without relying on pretrained components, offering architectural freedom and licensing flexibility.

Method: Trained from scratch with a unified tokenization scheme for diverse tasks, incorporating efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and speculative Jacobi sampling.

Result: Matches or surpasses diffusion models on benchmarks (GenEval, DPG) and excels in multi-task performance (Graph200K).

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a versatile foundation model for unified multimodal generation, with released training details and code.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B is a lightweight 3.3B parameter model for automated sports video analysis, outperforming larger models like GPT-4o with lower computational needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports video analysis lacks fine-grained understanding and efficiency, missing critical biomechanical phases.

Method: Combines temporal motion difference sampling, self-supervised learning, DWT-VGG16-LDA keyframe extraction, and a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder with an LLM decoder.

Result: Achieves 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in validation metrics, excelling in sports-specific criteria.

Conclusion: SV3.3B offers efficient, detailed sports analysis, suitable for on-device deployment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++ is a training-free framework using Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) to improve text-to-image generation for complex prompts by decomposing them into simpler sub-prompts and refining stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple subjects and attributes.

Method: Decomposes prompts into sub-prompts, uses self-attention for layout control, and employs cross-attention with Centroid Alignment Loss for attribute binding.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on T2I-CompBench and a new style benchmark, especially for multi-object and complex style scenarios.

Conclusion: Detail++ effectively addresses limitations in complex prompt handling through staged generation and improved attribute binding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M is a unified benchmark for fish detection, harmonizing 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations. It evaluates 28 models, introduces a CLIP-based selection framework, and provides tools for underwater vision research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols in underwater fish detection.

Method: Harmonized 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations, benchmarked 28 models, and introduced a CLIP-based model selection framework.

Result: Varied detection performance across models, with trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. CLIP-based selection achieved high performance without ensemble computation.

Conclusion: FishDet-M provides a standardized platform for underwater fish detection, supporting future research with publicly available datasets and tools.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using Generative AI (LightningDiT) to assess fairness in melanoma classifiers, highlighting challenges with dataset mismatches but advocating synthetic data for fairness evaluation in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in AI-based melanoma screening by ensuring fairness across diverse groups (sex, age, race) using representative evaluation datasets.

Method: Leverages the LightningDiT model to generate realistic synthetic data for fairness assessment of publicly available melanoma classifiers.

Result: Fairness assessment with synthetic data is promising but challenging when evaluation models are trained on different datasets than the synthetic images.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a valuable approach to evaluate and improve fairness in medical-imaging AI systems, despite dataset-mismatch challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer uses channel-wise self-attention for image restoration but misses localized artifacts. DiNA balances global and local context but struggles in deblurring. DiNAT-IR, with a channel-aware module, improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and quality trade-offs of self-attention in high-resolution image restoration by combining global and local context effectively.

Method: Propose DiNAT-IR, integrating Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to enhance global context understanding without losing local precision.

Result: DiNAT-IR achieves competitive performance in image restoration benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR offers a high-quality solution for low-level vision tasks by effectively balancing global and local context.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve UDA-SS by balancing local and global features, enhancing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle to balance fine-grained details with global context, causing segmentation errors.

Method: AFR refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components, and uses uncertainty-driven attention.

Result: AFR improves UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V→Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia→Cityscapes.

Conclusion: AFR's lightweight design and effectiveness make it a state-of-the-art solution for UDA-SS.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPEN, a dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults during virtual group learning, addressing gaps in existing research and achieving 81% accuracy in engagement recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate engagement measurement in virtual group settings, especially for older adults in telehealth, is challenging. Existing methods lack contextual relevance and longitudinal focus.

Method: The OPEN dataset was created from 11 older adults in weekly virtual cardiac rehabilitation sessions over six weeks, featuring extracted facial, hand, and body landmarks, along with affective and behavioral features.

Result: The dataset supports engagement recognition with up to 81% accuracy using machine learning and deep learning models.

Conclusion: OPEN provides a scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations and advances broader engagement recognition research.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

### [9] [Bearded Dragon Activity Recognition Pipeline: An AI-Based Approach to Behavioural Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17987)
*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated system using YOLO models detects bearded dragon behaviors (basking and hunting) in real-time, with YOLOv8s performing best. Basking detection is reliable, but hunting detection needs improvement due to weak cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon behavior is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Five YOLO variants were trained on a custom dataset (1200 images). YOLOv8s was selected for its accuracy-speed balance. The system processes video footage with object detection, temporal interpolation, and rule-based behavior classification.

Result: Basking detection was reliable (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855), but hunting detection was less accurate (mAP@0.5 = 0.392) due to poor cricket detection.

Conclusion: The system improves reptile behavior monitoring efficiency and data quality, with future work focusing on enhancing cricket detection.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

*Huy Nguyen,Kien Nguyen,Akila Pemasiri,Akmal Jahan,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset, and proposes TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture to address cross-platform and cross-modality challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions and limited coverage. Aerial perspectives solve these issues, but no dataset exists for aerial-ground cross-modality Re-ID.

Method: The authors introduce AG-VPReID.VIR dataset (1,837 identities, 4,861 tracklets) and propose TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture using style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and intermediary-guided temporal modeling.

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR presents unique challenges, and TCC-VPReID achieves significant performance gains across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address limitations of ground-based systems, offering a robust solution for aerial-ground cross-modality Re-ID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/agvpreid25/AG-VPReID.VIR.

### [11] [Exploring the interplay of label bias with subgroup size and separability: A case study in mammographic density classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17996)
*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how label bias in medical imaging datasets affects deep learning models, focusing on subgroup size and separability. Findings show shifts in learned features and performance disparities based on label bias conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of label bias in medical imaging datasets and its impact on the fairness of AI systems.

Method: Trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias in separable and non-separable subgroups.

Result: Label bias caused shifts in feature representations and performance differences, especially when validation sets had biased labels. For example, true positive rates dropped significantly for biased subgroups.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical impact of label bias on subgroup fairness in medical AI, emphasizing the need for clean validation labels to mitigate performance disparities.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [12] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimizable cost function for measuring distances between Grassmannian features, enabling improved registration in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack an explicit, optimizable distance function for Grassmannian features, limiting their use in registration problems.

Method: Derives an optimizable cost function using high-dimensional subspace bases and integrates it with a BnB solver for registration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing solutions by minimizing geodesic distance globally, improving convergence in vision tasks.

Conclusion: The optimizable cost function and BnB solver enhance registration accuracy and performance in computer vision applications.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRR-CoCa enhances the CoCa model with LLM-inspired architectural improvements, outperforming the baseline in pretraining and fine-tuning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lag behind LLMs in architectural sophistication, limiting performance.

Method: Incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into CoCa's textual decoders and ViT encoder.

Result: GRR-CoCa achieved significant improvements: 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss during pretraining. Fine-tuning showed 13.66%, 5.18%, and 5.55% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa's architecture enhances performance and generalization in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

*Yuezun Li,Delong Zhu,Xinjie Cui,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a large-scale DeepFake dataset with diverse forgery types to address the challenge of generalizable forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for datasets with diverse forgery types to develop generalizable DeepFake detection methods, as existing datasets lack variety.

Method: Expands the Celeb-DF dataset to include three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, Talking-face) using 22 DeepFake methods, and evaluates 24 detection methods.

Result: Highlights the limitations of current detection methods and the difficulty posed by the new dataset.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing generalizable DeepFake detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

### [15] [High-fidelity 3D Gaussian Inpainting: preserving multi-view consistency and photorealistic details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18023)
*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework is proposed to address challenges in 3D scene inpainting, leveraging sparse inpainted views and incorporating mask refinement and uncertainty-guided optimization for improved fidelity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is challenging due to irregular 3D structures and the need for multi-view consistency, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: The framework uses an automatic Mask Refinement Process and Uncertainty-guided Optimization, refining masks with Gaussian scene filtering and back-projection, and optimizing regions based on multi-view importance.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and view consistency, as demonstrated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses 3D inpainting challenges, offering superior results in fidelity and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

TL;DR: A survey on skeleton-based emotion recognition, covering psychological models, datasets, methods (posture/gait-based), and applications like mental health, with future challenges discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition via body movements is privacy-preserving and enhanced by 3D skeleton tech, offering an alternative to facial/physiological methods.

Method: Categorizes methods into posture/gait-based, with four technical paradigms: Traditional, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, End2EndNet, benchmarking datasets.

Result: Provides a unified taxonomy, reviews representative works, and benchmarks results across datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights applications in mental health and identifies open challenges for future research in skeleton-based emotion recognition.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

*Ahmad ALBarqawi,Mahmoud Nazzal,Issa Khalil,Abdallah Khreishah,NhatHai Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGText integrates images and Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) text explanations in a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection, outperforming traditional methods in generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated deepfakes challenges traditional detection methods, which lack generalization and robustness against attacks.

Method: ViGText divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-level feature extraction.

Result: ViGText achieves a significant performance boost (F1 scores from 72.45% to 98.32%) and 11.1% higher recall, with minimal degradation under attacks.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for deepfake detection by combining detailed visual and textual analysis, enhancing media authenticity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI-generated video models' ability to handle multi-scene prompts by learning coherent scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated video models struggle with longer videos requiring multiple scenes due to lack of scene transition awareness, as they are trained on single-scene clips.

Method: The authors propose the TAV dataset, containing preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through post-training experiments.

Result: Post-training on TAV improves scene transition understanding, reduces the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset enhances multi-scene video generation by addressing the challenge of coherent scene transitions.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BokehDiff is a new lens blur rendering method using generative diffusion prior for accurate and visually appealing results, overcoming depth estimation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from artifacts due to inaccurate depth estimation. BokehDiff aims to improve accuracy and visual quality.

Method: Uses a physics-inspired self-attention module, depth-dependent constraints, and a one-step diffusion inference scheme. Synthesizes photorealistic foregrounds with diffusion models.

Result: Achieves high-quality, artifact-free lens blur with fidelity.

Conclusion: BokehDiff effectively addresses depth estimation issues and enhances rendering quality using diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

*Xiaoran Sun,Liyan Wang,Cong Wang,Yeying Jin,Kin-man Lam,Zhixun Su,Yang Yang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-IMI is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) that uses vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and manual instructions (IMIs) to incorporate semantic guidance from normal-light images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods lack semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting their effectiveness in complex lighting conditions.

Method: VLM-IMI leverages VLMs with IMIs, using textual descriptions of normal-light content as enhancement cues. It includes an instruction prior fusion module to align and fuse image and text features dynamically.

Result: VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, especially in extremely low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates semantic guidance and iterative refinement, achieving superior LLIE performance.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS is a lightweight, text-driven adaptation of SAM for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, outperforming SOTA models with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer diagnosis via EUS is hindered by noise and low contrast, requiring large annotated datasets for supervised DL models.

Method: TextSAM-EUS uses text prompt learning with BiomedCLIP and LoRA-based SAM adaptation, requiring no manual prompts at inference.

Result: Achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, surpassing SOTA models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS offers efficient, robust EUS segmentation, pioneering prompt learning in SAM-based medical imaging.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance LULC mapping accuracy, aiding urban planning and policy-making in rapidly changing environments.

Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping is essential for urban and resource
planning, and is one of the key elements in developing smart and sustainable
cities.This study evaluates advanced LULC mapping techniques, focusing on
Look-Up Table (LUT)-based Atmospheric Correction applied to Cartosat
Multispectral (MX) sensor images, followed by supervised and semi-supervised
learning models for LULC prediction. We explore DeeplabV3+ and Cross-Pseudo
Supervision (CPS). The CPS model is further refined with dynamic weighting,
enhancing pseudo-label reliability during training. This comprehensive approach
analyses the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping techniques for various urban
planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat
MX images over time, we highlight shifts such as urban sprawl, shrinking green
spaces, and expanding industrial areas. This demonstrates the practical utility
of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) lack temporal awareness and generalization, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: The framework uses high-quality curated data for supervised fine-tuning, followed by difficulty-controlled reinforcement learning to refine temporal localization.

Result: The method outperforms existing models on multiple benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: High-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL are crucial for VTG, and the released resources aim to support further research and adoption.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

TL;DR: A Transformer model predicts fMRI responses to multimodal movies using visual, auditory, and language inputs, achieving strong performance by leveraging temporal and multimodal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge aims to develop encoding models for predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal movies.

Method: A sequence-to-sequence Transformer autoregressively predicts fMRI activity, integrating prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual cross-attention mechanisms. Pretrained models (VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, BridgeTower) extract stimulus features.

Result: The model performs well on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating effective brain activity prediction.

Conclusion: Temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling is effective for predicting brain activity, with potential for leveraging shared and subject-specific structures.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a framework for joint uncertainty modeling and OoD detection using free energy, outperforming conventional methods like MC Dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MC Dropout often fail to align with the semantic goal of OoD detection by focusing only on model or data uncertainty.

Method: Introduces a free-energy-based density estimator (Beta distribution) and integrates it with a posterior network for direct uncertainty estimation.

Result: Validated on benchmarks (Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, etc.), the method achieves semantically meaningful and efficient uncertainty-aware segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses OoD detection by leveraging free energy and Beta distribution variance, offering a superior alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VWorldBench is introduced as the first framework to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate semantically consistent and factually accurate content using world knowledge. It covers diverse domains and employs human and automated evaluation, revealing significant gaps in current models' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models lack evaluation on leveraging world knowledge for semantic consistency and factual accuracy, prompting the need for a systematic benchmark.

Method: The study proposes T2VWorldBench, evaluating 10 advanced models across 6 categories and 1,200 prompts using human and automated (VLM-based) assessments.

Result: Most models fail to generate correct videos due to poor understanding of world knowledge, highlighting a critical capability gap.

Conclusion: The findings identify a research opportunity to enhance text-to-video models with robust commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

*Kesheng Wang,Xiaoyu Chen,Chunlei He,Fenfen Li,Xinxin Yu,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang,Qi Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based framework for quantifying curve tortuosity in medical images, validated through meibomian gland atrophy analysis, shows high clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise tortuosity quantification is crucial for disease diagnosis and assessment, but traditional methods lack robustness and objectivity when biological reference curves are available.

Method: The framework integrates probability modeling, entropy theory, and domain transformation, comparing target curves to biologically plausible references instead of idealized lines.

Result: Applied to meibomian gland atrophy, the method distinguished between patient groups with high accuracy (AUC 0.8768, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.93).

Conclusion: The framework is effective for medical tortuosity analysis and has potential as a generalizable tool for morphological evaluation in diagnostics.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism for low-light image enhancement, improving degradation modeling and generation quality through adaptive feature interaction and reflection-aware correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with real-world degradation complexity, leading to structural and pixel inconsistencies.

Method: A bidirectional diffusion approach (low-to-normal and normal-to-low light) with adaptive feature interaction (AFI) and reflection-aware correction (RACM).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, generalizing well to diverse degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances image quality and aligns better with human visual perception by addressing degradation modeling challenges.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage UDA framework improves 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by combining contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling, outperforming direct transfer and single-model UDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in 3D LiDAR segmentation due to domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, location) is a critical issue, but manual annotation is impractical.

Method: 1. Unsupervised contrastive learning pre-trains a backbone for domain-invariant features. 2. Multi-model pseudo-labeling (ensemble of diverse architectures) generates refined pseudo-labels for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements on target datasets (SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges domain gaps without target annotations, proving the value of contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

*Dhruv Jain,Romain Modzelewski,Romain Hérault,Clement Chatelain,Eva Torfeh,Sebastien Thureau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba, a UNet-mamba hybrid with a Noise Reduction Module, improves medical image segmentation by filtering noise and enhancing relevant features, showing 1-5% gains in accuracy across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models overfit to noise in data-scarce medical image segmentation, limiting generalization.

Method: Combines UNet with mamba for long-range dependencies and introduces a Noise Reduction Module (NRM) to suppress irrelevant activations.

Result: Achieves 1-3% gains on public datasets (MSD, AIIB23) and 4-5% on a small NSCLC dataset.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness, especially in low-data settings.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

### [33] [MatSSL: Robust Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Metallographic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18184)
*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for micrograph analysis, outperforming supervised and other SSL methods with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods for micrograph analysis require retraining for new datasets and perform poorly with limited labels. SSL methods often need large datasets, which MatSSL aims to address.

Method: MatSSL uses Gated Feature Fusion to integrate multi-level representations, pretrains on small unlabeled data, and fine-tunes on benchmarks.

Result: Achieves 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM (vs. 66.73% with ImageNet) and up to 40% improvement on EBC compared to MicroNet.

Conclusion: MatSSL effectively adapts to metallographic domains with small unlabeled data while retaining transferable features from large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Xiaohao Chen,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion is a distillation method that simplifies text-to-image synthesis by fusing text embeddings, reducing inference costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and complex sampling strategies hinder efficiency in text-to-image synthesis.

Method: TeEFusion integrates guidance magnitude into text embeddings via linear operations, distilling the teacher model's sampling strategy without extra parameters.

Result: The student model achieves 6x faster inference speeds with comparable image quality to the teacher model.

Conclusion: TeEFusion offers an efficient alternative to CFG, balancing speed and quality in text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF is a medical image segmentation model using latent diffusion models, improving performance without altering architecture or increasing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack task-specific adjustments for segmentation and have feature extraction deficiencies.

Method: Replaces noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and uses feature distillation to align convolutional and transformer-based features.

Result: Enhances performance across multiple segmentation datasets without added parameters or computation.

Conclusion: LEAF efficiently improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining model simplicity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

*Xin Wei,Qin Yang,Yijie Fang,Mingrui Zhu,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDTTA introduces a graph spectral domain approach for efficient 3D point cloud test-time adaptation, outperforming existing methods by focusing on low-frequency components and using eigenmap-guided self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D TTA methods are computationally expensive and may require extra training data, motivating a shift to the graph spectral domain for more efficient adaptation.

Method: GSDTTA represents point clouds as outlier-aware graphs, transforms them via Graph Fourier Transform, optimizes the lowest 10% frequency components, and uses inverse GFT for reconstruction, enhanced by eigenmap-guided self-training.

Result: GSDTTA outperforms existing TTA methods in 3D point cloud classification, as shown by experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Shifting adaptation to the graph spectral domain enables efficient and effective 3D point cloud classification, addressing limitations of current TTA methods.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network to address domain gaps and temporal misalignment in feature-level fusion for collaborative perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-level fusion in collaborative perception is hindered by domain gaps from hardware diversity and temporal misalignment from delays, degrading feature quality.

Method: Proposes DATA network with Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM), Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM), and Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, robust to severe delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: DATA effectively aligns features and enhances semantic representations, improving collaborative perception.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthDark is a foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation, addressing dataset and fine-tuning challenges with flare/noise simulation and an efficient PEFT strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation methods perform poorly in low-light due to lack of datasets and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Method: Uses flare/noise simulation for dataset creation and an illumination-guided PEFT strategy for model enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets with limited resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark effectively addresses low-light depth estimation challenges, offering robust performance.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

TL;DR: LONG3R is a novel model for real-time, long-sequence multi-view 3D scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods by using memory gating and a dual-source decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view scene reconstruction are either slow or limited to short sequences, making them unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: LONG3R uses a memory gating mechanism, a dual-source refined decoder, and a 3D spatio-temporal memory for dynamic pruning and resolution adjustment. Training employs a two-stage curriculum strategy.

Result: LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, especially for long sequences, while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: LONG3R advances real-time, long-sequence 3D reconstruction, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning and a two-stage diffusion model to improve Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) resilience in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISTD methods rely on expensive manual-labeling data, making them fragile in real-world challenges. The study explores performance variations under data scarcity and proposes solutions.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction to enhance ISTD model resilience.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scarcity scenarios, improving detection quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses ISTD challenges in data-scarce environments, enhancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study used Mendelian randomization to explore causal links between dental traits (caries, periodontitis) and lung cancer, finding caries significantly increases lung cancer risk, mediated by lung function decline. No effect was found for periodontitis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify causal relationships between oral diseases (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer, addressing uncertainty from observational studies.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using genetic data from large GWAS studies, with inverse variance weighting and mediation analysis via the delta method.

Result: Dental caries significantly increased lung cancer risk (especially squamous cell carcinoma), mediated by declines in FVC and FEV1. Periodontitis showed no causal effect.

Conclusion: Dental caries causally increases lung cancer risk, suggesting dental care and lung function monitoring should be part of cancer prevention.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

TL;DR: LMM-Det is a novel approach using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for object detection without specialized modules, improving recall through data distribution adjustment and inference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs show gaps in object detection compared to specialist detectors, prompting the need for a simpler, effective solution.

Method: Proposes LMM-Det, leveraging LMMs for detection by adjusting data distribution and optimizing inference, without extra modules.

Result: Experiments show LMM-Det effectively enhances object detection capabilities in LMMs.

Conclusion: LMM-Det demonstrates LMMs can perform object detection without specialized modules, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FieldLVLM enhances LVLMs for scientific field data by combining field-aware language generation and data-compressed multimodal tuning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs lack effectiveness in scientific domains, particularly for complex field data interpretation.

Method: FieldLVLM uses field-aware language generation to extract key features and data-compressed tuning to simplify inputs.

Result: FieldLVLM outperforms existing methods on scientific field data tasks.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between LVLMs and domain-specific scientific research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Modified Nuclear Norm (MNN) framework for matrix recovery, capturing both local and global low-rank structures without parameter tuning, and provides theoretical guarantees for Robust PCA and matrix completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to jointly capture local and global low-rank structures without trade-off parameter tuning. The MNN framework addresses this gap.

Method: The MNN framework applies suitable transformations to the matrix and performs the nuclear norm on the transformed matrix, unifying local and global information.

Result: The MNN framework achieves exact recovery guarantees for Robust PCA and matrix completion, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The MNN framework is a flexible and effective approach for structured low-rank recovery, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVCCS, a new dataset for contrail tracking and analysis, and a deep learning framework for contrail segmentation and temporal tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails significantly impact aviation's climate effects, but existing models lack accurate data for validation. Observational datasets are limited in tracking and attributing contrails to flights.

Method: The authors present GVCCS, a ground-based camera dataset with labeled and tracked contrails, and propose a deep learning framework for panoptic segmentation and temporal tracking.

Result: The dataset includes 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) with flight identifiers. The deep learning model enables detailed contrail lifecycle analysis.

Conclusion: GVCCS and the proposed framework improve contrail monitoring and model calibration, aiding better climate impact assessments.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGCDet introduces an adaptive 3D volume construction framework for multi-view indoor 3D object detection, improving feature representation and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods limit voxel receptive fields to fixed image locations, lacking adaptability and efficiency.

Method: Uses a geometry and context aware aggregation module and sparse volume construction to refine features dynamically.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets.

Conclusion: SGCDet offers adaptive, efficient 3D detection without needing ground-truth scene geometry.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to classify bird species using song recordings by embedding frequency information into spectrograms with color additives, improving accuracy over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with bird song classification due to noise, overlapping vocalizations, and similar motifs across species.

Method: The approach visualizes pitch, speed, and repetition (motifs) in spectrograms and enhances distinction by embedding frequency information using primary color additives.

Result: The method outperforms the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by 7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency information via colorization effectively improves bird species classification accuracy.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExoBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on cross-view reasoning between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing their limitations in semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human intelligence excels at transferring knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) viewpoints, but MLLMs' ability in this area is unexplored.

Method: The authors introduce EgoExoBench, a benchmark with over 7,300 question-answer pairs across 11 sub-tasks, organized into three challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 13 MLLMs shows they perform well on single-view tasks but struggle with cross-view reasoning.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench aims to advance research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants by addressing the gap in cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Result: VB-Mitigator provides a unified environment for fair assessment and comparison of bias mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: VB-Mitigator accelerates fairness research in computer vision by offering a foundational codebase and best practices.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

*Lexuan Zhu,Yuxuan Li,Yuning Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks improves feature learning for complex shapes, applied successfully in fundus blood vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deformable convolutions lack global feature capture and adaptability for complex shapes like fundus blood vessels.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play module learning sub-pixel displacement fields to warp feature maps globally, decoupling kernel size from the learning network.

Result: GDCUnet, incorporating this module, achieves state-of-the-art performance in fundus vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: The module enhances feature learning and generalization, suggesting broader application in tasks with complex global features.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

*Xiaotian Chen,DongFu Yin,Fei Richard Yu,Xuanchen Li,Xinhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVG4D is a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally consistent 4D content from a single image using multi-view synthesis and 4D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic 4D content remains a challenge despite advances in generative modeling.

Method: MVG4D combines multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting, using an image matrix module for coherent multi-view images and a deformation network for temporal extension.

Result: MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like CLIP-I, PSNR, and FVD, reducing flickering and improving structural details.

Conclusion: MVG4D advances efficient and controllable 4D generation, enhancing AR/VR experiences.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of AI guidance in improving human performance in procedural tasks, supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration for physical task completion has significant

*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel one-stage architecture for pose generation directly from RGB images and text, outperforming existing methods by avoiding intermediate representations and maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods degrade in long-term pose generation due to reliance on intermediate representations or autoregressive models, leading to error accumulation and loss of temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes a one-stage model generating poses in continuous coordinate space using relative movement prediction and unified placeholder tokens, ensuring consistent training and inference behavior.

Result: Outperforms quantization-based and autoregressive methods on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets, especially in long-term scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates intermediate steps, improves performance, and maintains temporal coherence, making it superior for long-term pose generation.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenHumanBRDF, a high-quality dataset for full-body human inverse rendering, and proposes HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training and CPR loss for improved material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for full-body human inverse rendering lack realism, especially for skin, due to simplified material data and rendering constraints.

Method: Constructs OpenHumanBRDF dataset with detailed materials (e.g., displacement, subsurface scattering) and designs HumanMaterial with progressive training and CPR loss for balanced material estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenHumanBRDF and real data, enhancing rendering realism.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model significantly improve material estimation and rendering quality, particularly for skin.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer is a competitive and versatile approach, inspiring future research like Iwin 3D Attention. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image

TL;DR: DCFFSNet introduces a feature space decoupling strategy to balance connectivity and other features, outperforming existing models in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep networks lack a standardized mechanism to quantify feature strengths, leading to coupled feature spaces and suboptimal segmentation.

Method: Proposes DCFFSNet with a feature space decoupling strategy and dynamic multi-scale feature balancing.

Result: Outperforms top models on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets, improving Dice and IoU scores.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet resolves fragmentation and enhances edge transitions, boosting clinical usability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using V-JEPA, a self-supervised learning framework, for ultrasound video segmentation, enhancing it with a 3D localization task to improve ViT performance on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in acquiring and annotating large ultrasound datasets due to noise and artifacts motivate the use of SSL to leverage unlabelled data for better segmentation with limited annotations.

Method: Adopts V-JEPA for ultrasound video data, introduces a 3D localization auxiliary task to enhance ViT locality, and evaluates segmentation performance with varying training data.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation, achieving gains of 3.4% (100% data) and 8.35% (10% data).

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates V-JEPA's suitability for ultrasound imaging and the effectiveness of the proposed 3D localization task in improving ViT performance.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning method, NLML-HPE, uses tensor decomposition and neural networks for head pose estimation with limited data, addressing annotation inaccuracies and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head pose estimation is crucial for applications like human-computer interaction and facial recognition, but existing datasets often have inaccurate annotations, and traditional methods lack efficiency with limited data.

Method: Combines tensor decomposition (Tucker decomposition) and feed-forward neural networks to model head pose estimation as a regression problem, using cosine curves for manifold learning.

Result: Achieves real-time performance and accurate pose estimation with limited training data by leveraging precise synthetic data and efficient manifold learning.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE is an effective solution for head pose estimation, especially in scenarios with limited or noisy data, offering both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

### [60] [DSFormer: A Dual-Scale Cross-Learning Transformer for Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18444)
*Haiyang Jiang,Songhao Piao,Chao Gao,Lei Yu,Liguo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Dual-Scale-Former (DSFormer) and block clustering improves Visual Place Recognition (VPR) by enhancing feature representation and optimizing dataset organization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR struggles with reliability under varying conditions and viewpoints. This work aims to enhance robustness and efficiency.

Method: Integrates DSFormer for bidirectional feature transfer and block clustering to optimize dataset partitioning.

Result: Achieves top performance on benchmarks, reduces training data by 30%, and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, efficient solution for VPR, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

*Junda Wu,Jessica Echterhoff,Kyungtae Han,Amr Abdelraouf,Rohit Gupta,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding driver behavior using Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs), improving zero-shot performance by up to 73.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance driver safety systems by understanding behavior and intentions through visual evidence and MLLMs.

Method: Proposes PDB-Eval with components PDB-X (temporal scene evaluation) and PDB-QA (visual explanation QA for fine-tuning).

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs improves zero-shot QA by 73.2%, turn intention prediction by 12.5%, and AIDE tasks by up to 11.0%.

Conclusion: Fine-grained descriptions and explanations align MLLMs with driving tasks, enhancing performance without harming generalizability.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Method: The framework abstracts key elements of physical adversarial attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source code with benchmarking protocols for simulation and real-world settings.

Result: The framework successfully transfers simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system and offers insights into factors influencing attack success.

Conclusion: The proposed framework accelerates research, ensures fair comparisons, and advances understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Result: CRUISE achieves high-fidelity scene reconstruction, improves 3D detection and tracking, and generates challenging corner cases.

Conclusion: CRUISE is effective for V2X data augmentation and enhances autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of anomaly detection in medical images due to diverse anomalies and lack of annotated data.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained vision models as feature extractors, Q-Former architecture for bottleneck control, and perceptual loss for semantic guidance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of pretrained vision models for medical tasks without fine-tuning; code and models are publicly released.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Motivation: Reliable malaria diagnosis in developing countries requires accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood smears, but deep learning adoption is limited by scarce annotated datasets.

Method: The authors improved the NIH malaria dataset with detailed bounding box annotations, trained a Faster R-CNN model, and validated it via cross-validation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.88 for infected cell detection, highlighting the importance of annotation quality.

Conclusion: Automated annotation refinement with manual correction can produce high-quality training data for robust malaria detection, with the updated dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein-EAD is a proactive defense framework for 3D adversarial attacks, using adaptive exploration and interaction to enhance robustness, outperforming passive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of passive defense strategies in dynamic 3D adversarial settings by introducing a proactive approach.

Method: Leverages adaptive exploration, multi-step objective balancing accuracy and entropy minimization, and uncertainty-oriented reward shaping.

Result: Significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining standard accuracy, with robust generalization to unseen attacks.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is effective for real-world 3D adversarial contexts, offering adaptability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve trajectory prediction in autonomous driving by integrating map uncertainty, focusing on the agent's kinematic state and introducing a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating and Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mapless autonomous driving approaches lack reliability in online-generated maps, and existing methods for incorporating map uncertainty into trajectory prediction provide limited insights into beneficial scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze driving scenarios where map uncertainty impacts trajectory prediction, identify the agent's kinematic state as a key factor, and propose Proprioceptive Scenario Gating and Covariance-based Map Uncertainty for adaptive integration.

Result: The approach achieves up to 23.6% improvement in trajectory prediction performance on the nuScenes dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, offering interpretability and significant performance gains.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Method: Integrates deep object detection, probabilistic semantic fusion, and artificial foveation to dynamically generate attention maps and predict fixations.

Result: Achieves human-like scanpaths on COCO-Search18, surpassing baselines and competing with scanpath-informed models.

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST demonstrates the potential of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for realistic attention modeling, with applications in cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal

Motivation: To enable quantitative comparison of SAE-derived features across different model modalities (visual, textual, multimodal) and understand shared representations.

Method: Proposes a novel indicator for cross-modality SAE feature comparison and a metric for feature sharedness. Studies 21 encoders of varying sizes and datasets.

Result: Reveals shared features between visual and text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. Provides insights into multimodal model representations.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of shared features across modalities and demonstrates the influence of text pretraining on visual encoders. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Motivation: Detecting rare objects like bio-digesters in large remote sensing datasets is challenging but crucial for applications like environmental impact assessment.

Method: A part-based method is developed to detect bio-digesters by focusing on their sub-elements, applied to a novel dataset with imbalanced training and test sets.

Result: The method successfully builds an inventory of bio-digesters and estimates methane production using geostatistical techniques.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles rare object detection and provides actionable insights for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise and safe navigation in complex environments requires reliable 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which benefits from complementary sensor data fusion.

Method: Uses semantic 3D Gaussians and modality-agnostic deformable attention to fuse data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar, refining Gaussian properties for accurate environment representation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating versatility with various sensor combinations.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc's fusion of multi-modal data and Gaussian representation offers superior performance for autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack fine-grained spatial control in temporal sequences for intent-oriented video captioning.

Method: Proposes a prompt combination strategy and a parameter-efficient box adapter to unify temporal and spatial understanding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: The method enhances LVLMs' ability to model spatial details and generate accurate intent-oriented captions.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDA expands the design space of diffusion models by allowing arbitrary noise patterns, improving image restoration without extra computational cost. It outperforms task-specific methods in MRI, CT, and natural image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed Gaussian noise in diffusion models limits image restoration by corrupting degraded images and increasing complexity. EDA aims to address this by enabling arbitrary noise patterns.

Method: EDA extends the noise pattern freedom while maintaining module flexibility, proven to avoid extra computational overhead. It is tested on MRI bias correction, CT artifact reduction, and shadow removal.

Result: EDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in bias field correction and shadow removal with just 5 sampling steps, surpassing most task-specific methods.

Conclusion: EDA successfully broadens the noise design space for diffusion models, enhancing restoration performance without computational penalties.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

*Zhekai Chen,Ruihang Chu,Yukang Chen,Shiwei Zhang,Yujie Wei,Yingya Zhang,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTS-VAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, improving efficiency and performance through adaptive batch sizing, clustering-based diversity search, and resampling-based potential selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of scaling visual generation models by introducing a resource-efficient test-time scaling approach.

Method: Models generation as path searching, uses adaptive batch sizing, clustering for coarse scales, and resampling with potential scores for fine scales.

Result: Achieves an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (0.69 to 0.75) on the Infinity VAR model.

Conclusion: Early-stage structural features impact final quality, and resampling effectiveness varies by scale, validating TTS-VAR's design.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

*Chong Cheng,Zijian Wang,Sicheng Yu,Yu Hu,Nanjie Yao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework integrates MVS priors with probabilistic Procrustes mapping, enabling accurate reconstruction and pose estimation from hundreds of outdoor images without precise camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS models struggle with memory limits and accuracy for large-scale unposed reconstruction tasks.

Method: Partitions images into subsets, maps submaps globally using probabilistic Procrustes, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS via confidence-aware anchor points and differentiable rendering.

Result: Achieves accurate reconstruction and pose estimation on Waymo and KITTI datasets, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing MVS models for unposed 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS registration is proposed, using synthetic iUS volumes and supervised contrastive training, achieving superior performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative MRI registration is challenging due to modality differences. A robust, interpretable solution is needed.

Method: Patient-specific synthetic iUS generation, contrastive training, probabilistic keypoint detection, and curriculum-based triplet loss for descriptor learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art with 69.8% average precision and 2.39 mm mean registration error.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, initialization-free, and robust, offering a competitive solution for MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-modal feature representation and deep video content cognition by providing a dataset with detailed hierarchical descriptions and intent expressions.

Method: The dataset includes 103K videos with audio and three-layer textual descriptions (factual, abstract, intent), generated via Chain-of-Thought. It also provides annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent.

Result: A gold-standard benchmark with 3K manually validated samples is established. Evaluation results for models like InternVideo, VAST, and UMT-L are released.

Conclusion: VideoMind advances deep video understanding and cross-modal alignment, supporting tasks like emotion and intent recognition. The dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic images of chicken carcasses and a benchmark dataset to improve instance segmentation in poultry processing, showing synthetic data enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of chicken carcasses is crucial for quality control and efficiency, but real-world data collection and annotation are labor-intensive.

Method: The study uses a pipeline to create synthetic images and a real-world dataset, testing synthetic data's impact on instance segmentation models.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improves segmentation performance, demonstrating its value in addressing data scarcity.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation is an effective strategy to reduce annotation efforts and enhance AI-driven detection in poultry processing.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach for simultaneous age and gender classification from facial images, improving targeted advertising effectiveness with a custom CNN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance targeted advertising by improving age and gender classification accuracy using facial images.

Method: A custom CNN architecture optimized for both tasks, leveraging shared representations and trained on a diverse dataset with robust pre-processing.

Result: Achieved 95% gender classification accuracy and a mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Identified challenges in younger age groups.

Conclusion: The model shows promise but requires targeted data augmentation and refinement to address biases, with insights for future CNN research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

### [82] [Facial Demorphing from a Single Morph Using a Latent Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18566)
*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for demorphing face images, overcoming issues like morph replication and technique dependency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morph attacks create composite images biometrically linked to multiple identities, but current demorphing methods fail to handle diverse morph techniques or replicate the morph itself.

Method: Decomposes morphs in latent space, trained on synthetic faces and tested on real faces with arbitrary morph techniques.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, producing high-fidelity demorphed images even for unseen morph techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively demorphs faces, addressing limitations of current techniques and enhancing detection capabilities.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: DMDX improves score distillation by combining adversarial pre-training and fine-tuning, outperforming DMD2 in one-step performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mode collapse in DMD by introducing adversarial alignment of latent predictions.

Method: Propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM) with hybrid discriminators and distributional loss for better initialization.

Result: Superior one-step performance on SDXL and benchmarks in image/video synthesis.

Conclusion: DMDX sets a new standard for efficient distillation in generative models.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

TL;DR: HybridTM integrates Transformer and Mamba for 3D semantic segmentation, combining their strengths to address limitations in long-range dependency modeling and feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in attention but suffer from quadratic complexity, while Mamba offers linear complexity but struggles with feature representation. Combining these can enhance 3D segmentation.

Method: Proposes HybridTM, a hybrid architecture, and the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy to combine attention and Mamba for capturing long-range dependencies and local features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridTM effectively combines Transformer and Mamba, demonstrating superior performance and generalization in 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Motivation: Addressing challenges in preserving edge continuity and fine details under extreme illumination degradation in low-light image enhancement.

Method: Proposes DRWKV with GER theory for illumination-edge decoupling, Evolving WKV Attention for spatial edge continuity, and Bi-SAB with MS2-Loss for feature alignment.

Result: Achieves leading PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE scores on benchmarks, with low computational cost and improved performance in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DRWKV effectively enhances low-light images, preserving details and edges while generalizing well to other tasks.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC is a framework for refining synthetic image-caption datasets in Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) by reassigning captions to semantically aligned images, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models generate noisy synthetic image-caption pairs with semantic misalignments, hindering ZIC training. Existing pruning methods are unsuitable for synthetic data.

Method: SynC uses a one-to-many mapping strategy and cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer to reassign captions to the best images in the synthetic pool.

Result: SynC significantly improves ZIC model performance on benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SynC effectively refines synthetic data for ZIC, offering a robust solution to semantic misalignment issues.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

TL;DR: Scenethesis introduces a novel 3D software synthesis approach with formal traceability, addressing limitations in current methods by enabling fine-grained control and constraint handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D software generation lacks granular control and struggles with spatial/semantic constraints, prompting the need for a more flexible and constraint-aware solution.

Method: Scenethesis uses ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language, as an intermediate representation to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software, enabling staged synthesis and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Scenethesis captures 80% of user requirements, satisfies 90% of hard constraints, and improves visual evaluation scores by 42.8% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Scenethesis effectively addresses the challenges of 3D software generation, offering precise control, constraint handling, and significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: SIDA introduces a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images to capture real-world variations efficiently, outperforming text-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven methods for zero-shot domain adaptation struggle with complex variations and slow adaptation. Image data offers finer style cues.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images via source-like images and style translation, using Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer for diverse style modeling.

Result: SIDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in challenging domains and reduces adaptation time significantly.

Conclusion: Leveraging synthetic images for style features is more effective and efficient than text-driven methods in zero-shot domain adaptation.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Motivation: To address the controversial use of artist names in text-to-image prompts and enable responsible moderation of such models.

Method: Created a dataset of 1.95M images from 110 artists, tested feature similarity, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models perform well on seen artists and complex prompts, while style descriptors excel for pronounced styles; multi-artist prompts are the hardest.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights significant room for improvement and aims to advance responsible moderation of text-to-image models.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: To automate the creation of visually coherent and narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Method: Uses top-down keyframe planning for storyline coherence, followed by bottom-up video synthesis with MM-DiT trained on interleaved cinematic data.

Result: Produces high-quality, narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema effectively automates short movie generation with visual and narrative coherence.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:
