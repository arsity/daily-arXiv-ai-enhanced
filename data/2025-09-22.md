### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM2VEC4CXR and LLM2CLIP4CXR are domain-adapted models that use LLM encoders to improve radiology image-text alignment by handling noisy clinical reports better than scaling data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology vision-language pretraining is limited by heterogeneous clinical reports with abbreviations and stylistic variations. Simply scaling data with noisy reports can plateau or degrade performance, unlike general domains.

Method: Introduces LLM2VEC4CXR (domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports) and LLM2CLIP4CXR (dual-tower framework coupling LLM encoder with vision backbone). Trained on 1.6M CXR studies with heterogeneous reports.

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation. LLM2CLIP4CXR boosts retrieval accuracy and clinical alignment with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants.

Conclusion: Robustness, not scale alone, is key to effective multimodal learning in radiology. Models demonstrate better handling of noisy clinical reports and improved cross-dataset performance.

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec introduces vision-aware speculative decoding for VLMs, achieving substantial speedups by using a lightweight vision adaptor to compress image tokens and enhance multimodal coherence, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding is effective for LLMs but underperforms for VLMs with modest speedups (<1.5x). As multimodal capabilities become central to large models, there's a need to accelerate VLM inference while maintaining textual comprehension.

Method: ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor to compress image tokens into compact representations integrated into draft model's attention. It extracts global image features for text tokens and uses a specialized training dataset with extended outputs generated from target VLM.

Result: Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding, overcoming previous limitations of modest acceleration.

Conclusion: ViSpec successfully addresses the gap in VLM speculative decoding by effectively filtering redundant image information layer by layer while preserving multimodal coherence, enabling significant inference acceleration for vision-language models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE is a multimodal compliance framework that uses a mother-child MLLM setup to evaluate advertisement compliance across 15+ attributes, reducing inference costs by 31x while maintaining comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance frameworks use disjointed multi-stage pipelines that are inefficient and hard to scale. MLLMs offer potential to unify vision-language compliance checking into a single framework.

Method: Proposes M-PACE framework with mother-child MLLM architecture where a stronger parent model evaluates outputs of smaller child models. Uses human-annotated benchmark with augmented samples simulating real-world challenges.

Result: Achieves 31x cost reduction (from $0.0159 to $0.0005 per image) with comparable accuracy. Most efficient setup uses Gemini 2.0 Flash as child model selected by mother MLLM.

Conclusion: M-PACE demonstrates effective automation of multimodal compliance checking with significant cost savings, reducing dependence on human reviewers while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion is a hybrid framework that combines deep learning with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to predict 3D structures of large protein complexes, overcoming limitations of pure AI methods and expensive experimental techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods struggle with large protein complexes due to missing 3D spatial cues, while experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. A cost-effective hybrid approach is needed.

Method: Developed a virtual AFM framework to generate synthetic multi-view AFM images (~542,000 proteins), trained a conditional diffusion model for novel view synthesis, and used instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for 3D reconstruction.

Result: Reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve average Chamfer Distance within AFM imaging resolution, demonstrating high structural fidelity. Validated on experimental AFM images of various protein complexes.

Conclusion: ProFusion shows strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and enables rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEL framework enhances vision-language model interpretability through hierarchical semantic relationship processing while maintaining performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying vision-language models in safety-critical contexts is challenging due to complex object relationships, subtle visual cues, and demands for transparency and reliability

Method: Builds on Grad-eclip with novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module featuring multi-scale feature processing, adaptive attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment at multiple semantic levels

Result: Produces more focused and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how models process complex scenes, generalizing across domains

Conclusion: MMEL offers valuable insights into model decisions for applications requiring high interpretability and reliability

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAP (Navigation-Aware Pruning) is a token pruning method for Vision-and-Language Navigation that uses navigation-specific filtering to preserve critical information while achieving over 50% FLOPS reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard token pruning methods overlook VLN-specific challenges where information loss can lead to longer navigation paths, undermining efficiency gains. VLN requires preserving navigation-critical tokens.

Method: Uses navigation-aware filtering to pre-classify tokens into foreground (navigation-relevant) and background. Filters image views based on navigable directions and extracts navigation-relevant instructions using LLMs. Focuses pruning on background tokens and removes low-importance navigation nodes to prevent backtracking.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior pruning methods on standard VLN benchmarks, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

Conclusion: Navigation-aware token filtering enables effective pruning for VLN by preserving critical navigation information, achieving substantial efficiency gains without performance degradation.

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff is a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that uses dual-module transformation on diffusion model representations to simultaneously ensure fairness/safety and maintain semantic alignment without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving fairness and safety in text-to-image generation typically sacrifice semantic fidelity and image quality, creating a trade-off that RespoDiff aims to overcome.

Method: The approach introduces two learnable modules: one for enforcing responsible concepts (fairness/safety) and another for maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts, coordinated through a novel score-matching objective applied to intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models.

Result: RespoDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts, and integrates seamlessly with large-scale models like SDXL.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the fairness-safety vs. quality trade-off in text-to-image generation, enabling responsible generation without compromising semantic alignment or image fidelity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether autoguidance and online data selection methods (specifically JEST) can improve time and sample efficiency in training generative diffusion models, finding that autoguidance consistently improves quality while early data selection shows limited benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of generative models by exploring efficient data curation methods that could improve training efficiency for diffusion models.

Method: Integrated JEST and autoguidance into a unified codebase for benchmarking, evaluated on 2-D synthetic data and 3x64x64 image generation tasks, comparing methods at equal wall-clock time and sample counts while accounting for selection overhead.

Result: Autoguidance consistently improved sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST could match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency, but its time overhead and complexity made autoguidance or uniform random selection preferable in most cases.

Conclusion: Targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, but robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. Data selection may be beneficial in specific scenarios despite limitations.

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [9] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a scalable framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images using phase-enhanced radial-based image signature mapping in the frequency domain to achieve model attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for attribution methods to identify which model generated AI content, especially in commercial settings where users expect guarantees about content sources.

Method: PRISM uses radial reduction of discrete Fourier transform leveraging amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures, followed by linear discriminant analysis clustering for reliable attribution.

Result: Achieved 92.04% attribution accuracy on PRISM-36K dataset, 81.60% average accuracy on four benchmarks, and 88.41% average accuracy for real vs fake detection, with best result of 95.06% on GenImage benchmark.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain fingerprinting is effective for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable solution for accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of vision transformers (ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, DINOv3) on mental rotation tasks shows self-supervised models capture geometric structure better than supervised ones, with intermediate layers outperforming final layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well modern vision transformers develop mental rotation abilities similar to humans, which is a key test of spatial reasoning.

Method: Probing model representations layer by layer across various mental rotation tasks including simple block structures, complex figures, text, and photo-realistic objects.

Result: Self-supervised ViTs outperform supervised ViTs in capturing geometric structure; intermediate layers show better performance than final layers; task difficulty patterns mirror human reaction times.

Conclusion: Vision transformers exhibit mental rotation capabilities with patterns similar to human cognition, suggesting similar constraints in their embedding space representations.

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

### [11] [Which Direction to Choose? An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272)
*Yannis Kaltampanidis,Alexandros Doumanoglou,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered Vision Transformer (ViT) features for image classification and segmentation tasks, without using additional transformation layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL approaches for ViTs often use additional transformation layers or distillation to improve performance, but there's no comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic capabilities of raw ViT features themselves.

Method: The study evaluates unmodified ViT features using hyperplane-based (logistic regression) and cosine-similarity based classification/segmentation rules across different token types, tasks, and pre-trained models.

Result: The analysis provides insights into optimal token type and decision rule choices based on task context and pre-training objectives, with detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Conclusion: This research bridges the gap in understanding the inherent representation power of raw ViT features and offers guidance for selecting appropriate token types and decision rules for different computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoMER, a benchmark to evaluate large multimodal models' reasoning capabilities in embodied environments, highlighting current limitations and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well foundation models can perform structured, step-by-step reasoning for real-world embodied tasks, which require safety, spatial coherence, and contextual grounding.

Method: Proposed the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark with over 1.1k samples across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, using a novel evaluation framework that separates perceptual grounding from action reasoning.

Result: Empirical analysis of leading LMMs reveals both potential and current limitations in embodied reasoning, identifying key challenges for future research.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for advancing robot intelligence by addressing the gaps in LMMs' embodied reasoning capabilities, with data and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

*Min Zhang,Bo Jiang,Jie Zhou,Yimeng Liu,Xin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDoL proposes a novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning method that uses domain information to create better prompts and improve vision-language embedding alignment for enhanced out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP methods suffer from inaccurate text descriptions and limited vision-language embedding alignment, which degrades accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance in zero-shot settings.

Method: The paper introduces Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) that utilizes domain information to form prompts, and a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional tokens capturing both instance-specific and domain-specific information.

Result: Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DigitDG) validate CoDoL's effectiveness in improving vision-language embedding alignment and out-of-distribution generalization performance.

Conclusion: CoDoL successfully addresses the limitations of prompt-based CLIP methods by leveraging domain information and improving vision-language alignment, demonstrating superior OOD generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

Motivation: Current machine vision models process entire scenes at once, leading to excessive computational demands that scale with input resolution and model size. This creates limitations for future advancements and real-world applications. Human vision, in contrast, efficiently samples environments through sequential fixations on task-relevant regions.

Method: AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process. It progressively identifies and attends to task-relevant regions, combines information across fixations, and actively concludes observation when sufficient. The framework integrates representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning for end-to-end training without additional supervision on fixation locations.

Result: On 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks (including large-scale recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, driving/medical scenarios, and embodied AI), AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy. It adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, provides enhanced interpretability via fixation patterns, and exhibits human-like perceptual behaviors.

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN demonstrates a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. It also shows potential as a tool for investigating visual cognition due to its human-like perceptual behaviors. The framework represents a paradigm shift from passive to active, adaptive vision models.

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

### [15] [LowDiff: Efficient Diffusion Sampling with Low-Resolution Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15342)
*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff is an efficient diffusion framework that uses cascaded resolution generation to speed up sampling while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have slow sampling speeds that hinder practical applications. Existing methods focus on model compression or reducing denoising steps, but overlook leveraging multiple input resolutions.

Method: Proposes LowDiff, a cascaded diffusion framework that generates increasingly higher resolution outputs using a unified model to progressively refine images from low to high resolution.

Result: Achieves over 50% throughput improvement across datasets while maintaining comparable or better quality. On CIFAR-10: FID 2.11/IS 9.87 (unconditional), FID 1.94/IS 10.03 (conditional). On FFHQ 64x64: FID 2.43. On ImageNet 256x256: FID 4.00/IS 195.06.

Conclusion: LowDiff demonstrates substantial efficiency gains with comparable or superior performance, applicable to both pixel and latent space diffusion models across various generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL is a region-level gating mechanism for Stable Diffusion XL that sparsifies cross-attention logits to reduce compositional failures in multi-object prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations due to cross-token interference where entities entangle and attributes mix across objects.

Method: Proposes a binary mask per layer injected into cross-attention logits before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions, preserving only semantically relevant connections without positional encodings or external masks.

Result: The model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: Logit-level masked cross-attention is a data-efficient primitive for enforcing compositional control, serving as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

### [17] [RaceGAN: A Framework for Preserving Individuality while Converting Racial Information for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15391)
*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN is a novel framework for multi-domain racial attribute translation that maintains individuality and high-level semantics without requiring reference images, outperforming existing models in translating Asian, White, and Black racial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN models like CycleGAN, StarGAN, and StarGANv2 have limitations in handling multi-domain racial translation - either restricted to domain pairs, unable to map low-level style changes, or requiring reference images while not maintaining individuality.

Method: RaceGAN uses a novel framework that maps style codes across multiple domains during racial attribute translation, maintaining individuality and high-level semantics without relying on reference images. It's tested on the Chicago Face Dataset.

Result: RaceGAN outperforms other models in translating racial features (Asian, White, Black) and demonstrates effectiveness through quantitative evaluation using InceptionReNetv2-based classification. The model successfully partitions the latent space into distinct clusters for each ethnic group.

Conclusion: RaceGAN provides an effective solution for racial attribute translation that maintains individual identity while achieving superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without the need for reference images.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

*Kunal Rathore,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to generate global symbolic explanations for deep learning models by transferring user-defined part labels from limited images to larger datasets, reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are opaque, and existing explanation methods either provide only local visual explanations or require extensive annotations for concept-based explanations, which is costly.

Method: Leverage user-defined part labels from a small set of images and efficiently transfer them to a larger dataset. Aggregate part-based local explanations to create global symbolic explanations.

Result: Enables generation of human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large scale without requiring extensive labeling efforts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient way to create global symbolic explanations for deep learning models, making them more interpretable while minimizing annotation costs.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

### [19] [Causal Fingerprints of AI Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15406)
*Hui Xu,Chi Liu,Congcong Zhu,Minghao Wang,Youyang Qu,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal fingerprint framework for generative model attribution that disentangles model-specific traces from image content and style using diffusion reconstruction residuals, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model fingerprinting methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, which have limited generalization across different generative models. The authors argue that a complete fingerprint should reflect the causal relationship between image provenance and model traces.

Method: A causality-decoupling framework that disentangles causal fingerprints from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residuals. The approach enhances fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.

Result: Experiments show the approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution across representative GANs and diffusion models. The method also achieves source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints.

Conclusion: The proposed causal fingerprint framework demonstrates strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection, indicating that causality-based approaches provide more robust model attribution than previous methods.

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

*Moinak Bhattacharya,Angelica P. Kurtz,Fabio M. Iwamoto,Prateek Prasanna,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuro-oncology specific foundation model with distributionally robust optimization was developed to improve generalization across institutions and prediction of both common and uncommon molecular markers in brain tumors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuro-oncology faces challenges with heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting foundation models' generalization. Existing models perform poorly on uncommon molecular markers essential for treatment response and risk stratification.

Method: Pretrained self-supervised backbones (BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class imbalance. Evaluated on molecular classification and survival prediction across multiple institutions.

Result: Improved molecular prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. Mean balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676 at CUIMC, with largest gains for underrepresented endpoints. Survival c-index improved at all sites (CUIMC: 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn: 0.647 to 0.672, UCSF: 0.600 to 0.627).

Conclusion: Coupling foundation models with DRO yields more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon markers, and enhances survival discrimination, highlighting the need for prospective validation and integration of longitudinal data for precision neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

### [21] [ORCA: Agentic Reasoning For Hallucination and Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15435)
*Chung-En Johnny Yu,Hsuan-Chih,Chen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA is an agentic reasoning framework that improves factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through test-time structured inference reasoning with small vision models, using an Observe-Reason-Critique-Act loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit strong multimodal capabilities but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: ORCA operates via an Observe-Reason-Critique-Act loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without access to model internals or retraining. It uses small vision models (<3B parameters) and stores intermediate reasoning traces.

Result: On the POPE hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64% to +40.67%. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE, ORCA achieves +20.11% average accuracy gain. On adversarially perturbed AMBER images with defense, ORCA improves performance by +1.20% to +48.00% across metrics.

Conclusion: ORCA offers a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems by improving factual accuracy and adversarial robustness without requiring model retraining or adversarial training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

TL;DR: RAD-Conv is a new convolutional operator that uses boundary offsets to create flexible rectangular sampling regions, enabling precise control over receptive field size and shape while maintaining convolution efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deformable convolutions are limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, which restricts their ability to adapt to complex image structures. There's a need to bridge the gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally expensive attention mechanisms.

Method: Uses four boundary offsets per kernel element to create flexible rectangular regions that dynamically adjust size and shape. Decouples receptive field shape from kernel structure, allowing precise width and height control even with small 1x1 kernels.

Result: Enables capture of both local details and long-range dependencies. Combines adaptability of attention mechanisms with efficiency of standard convolutions.

Conclusion: RAD-Conv provides a practical solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, offering better adaptation to complex image structures while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

TL;DR: CAGE is a robust framework for reconstructing vector floorplans from point-cloud density maps using a native edge-centric formulation that models wall segments as directed, geometrically continuous edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corner-based polygon representations are sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, leading to fragmented layouts. Recent line grouping methods struggle with fine geometric details.

Method: Proposes a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, modeling wall segments as directed continuous edges to ensure watertight room boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1 scores of 99.1% (rooms), 91.7% (corners), and 89.3% (angles) on Structured3D and SceneCAD datasets, demonstrating strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: CAGE provides a robust solution for floorplan reconstruction with improved geometric continuity and topological validity, outperforming existing methods while ensuring faster convergence.

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach using longitudinal multimodal data to improve pulmonary nodule diagnosis, addressing data scarcity and overfitting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is limited by scarce labeled data and tendency to overfit on training distributions.

Method: Leverage self-supervised learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives using joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining on unlabeled CT scans and electronic health records, followed by supervised finetuning.

Conclusion: The approach innovatively leverages unlabeled multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models, demonstrating both advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

TL;DR: EDGE is a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation that addresses correlation and diversity challenges, achieving 18x faster performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases computing resource requirements and takes days to process distillation. The growing importance of multimodal datasets (especially image-text) with large language models necessitates more efficient distillation methods.

Method: Proposes a novel generative model training workflow with bi-directional contrastive loss and diversity loss to address lack of correlation between generated images/captions and lack of diversity. Also introduces caption synthesis strategy to improve text-to-image retrieval performance.

Result: Evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Achieves results 18x faster than state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: EDGE provides an efficient solution for multimodal dataset distillation that overcomes key challenges in generative distillation methods while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: OpenViGA is an open video generation system for automotive driving scenes that addresses limitations of previous approaches by providing modular analysis, using pre-trained open-source models, and ensuring full reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing video generation systems that use large models requiring significant training resources, offer limited design insights, and lack publicly available code and datasets.

Method: Builds a modular system with three components (image tokenizer, world model, video decoder) using pre-trained open-source models fine-tuned on publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) with streamlined interfaces.

Result: Successfully generates realistic driving scene videos at 256x256 resolution and 4 fps with only one frame of algorithmic latency.

Conclusion: OpenViGA demonstrates that effective video generation for automotive scenes can be achieved using open-source components and publicly available data while maintaining reproducibility and academic-scale feasibility.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

<details>

Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology but little is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. The study aims to understand how different training approaches shape model representations and their robustness.

Method: Used representational similarity analysis on H&E image patches from TCGA to compare six CPath foundation models spanning vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI v2, Virchow v2, Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Analyzed slide-dependence, disease-dependence, and intrinsic dimensionality.

Result: UNI2 and Virchow2 had the most distinct representational structures, while Prov-Gigapath had highest average similarity across models. Same training paradigm didn't guarantee higher similarity. All models showed high slide-dependence but low disease-dependence. Stain normalization reduced slide-dependence by 5.5-20.5%. Vision-language models had more compact representations than vision-only models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape representations. The framework is extendable across medical imaging domains to help ensure effective development and deployment of foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

TL;DR: SmolRGPT is a compact 600M-parameter vision-language model that incorporates RGB and depth cues for efficient spatial reasoning in resource-constrained environments, achieving competitive performance against larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models are too large for deployment in resource-constrained environments like warehouses and robotics, where both efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical.

Method: A compact vision-language architecture with three-stage curriculum: progressive visual-language feature alignment, spatial relationship understanding, and task-specific adaptation using both RGB and depth cues.

Result: With only 600M parameters, SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding performance of much larger alternatives.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates potential for efficient, deployable multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pruning approach with learned selection mechanism and invertible mask for backdoor defense, formulated as bi-level optimization to eliminate backdoors while preserving clean task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning-based defenses fail to accurately identify backdoor parameters, while fine-tuning approaches dominate but pruning offers better interpretability and robustness in low-data regimes.

Method: Proposes learned selection mechanism to identify critical parameters, invertible pruning mask for simultaneous backdoor elimination and preservation, formulated as bi-level optimization with inner trigger synthesis and outer mask refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning-based approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, effectively restores correct predictions for compromised samples.

Conclusion: The proposed invertible pruning approach provides an effective defense against backdoor attacks with improved interpretability and robustness, particularly suitable for low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

*Junbiao Pang,Tianyang Cai,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEC-Quant is a novel quantization-aware training method that addresses representation bias in low-bit quantization by optimizing representation structure using maximum entropy principles, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to full-precision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT methods still produce inferior performance compared to full-precision models, especially in extremely low-bit settings, due to quantization introducing biases into learned representations.

Method: Proposes Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant) that uses minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a surrogate for entropy, with a scalable Mixture of Experts (MOE) reformulation for fast computation and handling long-tailed distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments show MEC-Quant pushes QAT limits to x-bit activation for the first time, achieving accuracy comparable to or surpassing full-precision counterparts, establishing new state-of-the-art for QAT.

Conclusion: MEC-Quant provides a principled approach to quantization that explicitly optimizes representation structure, effectively reducing bias and improving generalization, making it a superior QAT method across various computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

TL;DR: GUI-ARP is a novel framework for GUI grounding that uses adaptive multi-stage inference with Adaptive Region Perception and Adaptive Stage Controlling to improve fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots, requiring a more adaptive approach to handle varying complexity levels.

Method: Proposes GUI-ARP framework with Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) for task-relevant region cropping and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC) for dynamic inference strategy. Uses two-phase training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9% on UI-Vision benchmark using a 7B model, outperforming larger 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%).

Conclusion: GUI-ARP demonstrates that adaptive multi-stage inference with proper training pipeline enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance against much larger models in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

*Sen Wang,Jingyi Tian,Le Wang,Zhimin Liao,Jiayi Li,Huaiyi Dong,Kun Xia,Sanping Zhou,Wei Tang,Hua Gang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO is a hybrid world model framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling with causal modeling to improve temporal consistency and rollout efficiency in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling.

Method: SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, uses an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer, and includes a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories.

Result: SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving generation quality with 4.4× faster inference, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively addresses limitations of existing autoregressive world models by preserving spatial locality, supporting parallel decoding, and improving dynamic scene understanding through motion prompts.

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

*Wei Chen,Tongguan Wang,Feiyue Xue,Junkai Li,Hui Liu,Ying Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A symmetrical bidirectional multimodal learning framework for desire, emotion, and sentiment recognition that enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities using mixed-scale image processing and cross-modal decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches for sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. Multimodal approaches specifically targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored despite desire being a key intention that drives human behavior.

Method: Proposes a symmetrical bidirectional framework with text-guided image decoder and image-guided text decoder. Uses low-resolution images for global visual representations and high-resolution images partitioned into sub-images with masked image modeling for fine-grained local features. Adopts mixed-scale image strategy to balance perceptual gains with computation cost.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis on the MSED multimodal dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetrical bidirectional multimodal learning framework effectively captures intention-related representations in images and demonstrates consistent improvements across desire understanding, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance RVOS performance without additional training by addressing false positives and improving temporal context capture in existing Sa2VA framework.

Method: Introduces two components: (1) Video-Language Checker to verify subject/action presence in video, reducing false positives; (2) Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames for better temporal context.

Result: Achieved J&F score of 64.14% on MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in RVOS track of 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025.

Conclusion: The training-free framework successfully improves RVOS performance by incorporating explicit verification mechanisms and adaptive frame sampling.

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GS is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that addresses sparse-view reconstruction and multi-appearance challenges in real-world photo collections by leveraging monocular depth priors and geometry-guided supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-the-wild photo collections often have limited imagery with varying appearances (different times/seasons), causing oversmoothing and overfitting issues in existing NeRF and 3DGS methods for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Method: Built on geometric priors from monocular depth estimations, MS-GS extracts local semantic regions using SfM points for alignment, and employs geometry-guided supervision at virtual views with fine-grained and coarse schemes to ensure 3D consistency and reduce overfitting.

Result: MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions, significantly outperforming existing approaches across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-GS framework effectively handles sparse-view reconstruction with multiple appearances through geometric priors and virtual view supervision, establishing more realistic benchmarks for in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-Feat is a framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, fuses them for multi-label classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification requires powerful representations that can capture multi-label interactions. Existing methods may not fully leverage the rich intermediate features available in diffusion-Transformer models.

Method: Extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models at specific timesteps and blocks, uses a heuristic local-search algorithm to find optimal image-text block-timestep pairs, and fuses features via linear projection and addition.

Result: Achieves 98.6% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines. t-SNE and clustering metrics show tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Conclusion: Diff-Feat demonstrates that carefully selected intermediate features from diffusion-Transformer models can be effectively fused for superior multi-label classification performance, with consistent patterns observed across datasets.

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Motivation: Vision and hearing diseases cause preventable disability in resource-constrained settings with few specialists and limited screening capabilities. AI-assisted screening has potential for early detection but lacks documented field experience for practical deployment.

Method: Iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through early prototyping, shadow deployment, and continuous feedback to build shared understanding and reduce usability hurdles when transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows.

Result: Public datasets and AI models are useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. Automated AI-based image quality checks are needed to capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.

Conclusion: AI development and workflow digitization should be treated as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. Documenting practical challenges and lessons learned addresses the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world AI-assisted telehealth programs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in

upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to

  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and

TL;DR: DC-Mamba introduces an 'align-then-enhance' framework with BTDA for geometric alignment and SSCA for change signal amplification, significantly improving RSCD performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSCD methods, including State Space Models, lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and struggle to distinguish subtle true changes from noise, leading to reduced accuracy.

Method: Proposes DC-Mamba framework with two modules: Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA) for geometric correction at semantic feature level, and Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier (SSCA) for selective amplification of high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise.

Result: Significant performance improvement over ChangeMamba baseline, increasing F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU from 0.4015 to 0.4187, demonstrating effectiveness in handling geometric and feature-level challenges.

Conclusion: The 'align-then-enhance' strategy provides a robust, easily deployable solution that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven GUI interaction systems deviate from natural human communication patterns, creating a gap in how humans naturally interact with graphical interfaces.

Method: Develops a three-phase framework: Blink for rapid screen attention detection, Think for higher-level reasoning, and Link for executable command generation. Introduces automated Blink Data Generation and BTL Reward mechanism for reinforcement learning.

Result: BTL-UI model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks across comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides conclusive empirical validation for developing advanced GUI agents that better mimic natural human interaction patterns.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

### [41] [Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15573)
*Shilong Bao,Qianqian Xu,Feiran Li,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies a size bias in Salient Object Detection (SOD) metrics where larger objects dominate evaluation scores, proposes a Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework to address this, and develops SIOpt optimization for size-invariant detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD evaluation metrics are inherently size-sensitive, causing larger objects to dominate performance assessments while overlooking smaller but potentially more important objects, leading to biased evaluations.

Method: Proposes SIEva framework that evaluates each object component individually and aggregates results, plus SIOpt optimization framework that follows size-invariant principles and can be integrated with various SOD backbones.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows current metrics decompose into size-proportional terms, and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed size-invariant approach.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the size bias problem in SOD evaluation and provides both theoretical foundations and practical solutions for more balanced performance assessment across objects of different sizes.

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

### [45] [Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608)
*Zheng Wang,Hong Liu,Zheng Wang,Danyi Li,Min Cen,Baptiste Magnier,Li Liang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rasa is a novel framework that uses pathology reports to enhance WSI-based survival analysis through LLM-based text extraction and self-distillation with risk-aware mix-up strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WSI-based survival analysis faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, while pathology reports contain rich patient-specific information that remains unexplored for enhancing WSI analysis.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract fine-grained WSI-relevant descriptions from pathology reports, then employs self-distillation to filter irrelevant WSI features guided by textual knowledge, and incorporates risk-aware mix-up strategy for data augmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on CRC and TCGA-BRCA datasets demonstrate superior effectiveness against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Rasa framework successfully leverages pathology reports to improve WSI-based survival analysis, showing promising results for cancer prognosis evaluation.

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

### [46] [PCSR: Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement for Noisy Correspondence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15623)
*Zhuoyao Liu,Yang Liu,Wentao Feng,Shudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSR framework improves cross-modal retrieval by addressing noisy correspondences through pseudo-label consistency-based sample refinement and adaptive optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal retrieval methods assume perfect image-text alignment, but real data contains noisy correspondences that degrade performance. Current approaches use coarse clean/noisy categorization and uniform training, failing to handle diverse noisy sample characteristics effectively.

Method: PCSR uses confidence-based estimation to identify clean/noisy pairs, then refines noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency to identify structurally distinct subsets. It introduces Pseudo-label Consistency Score (PCS) to separate ambiguous and refinable samples, and applies Adaptive Pair Optimization with robust loss for ambiguous samples and text replacement for refinable ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and Flickr30K demonstrate improved retrieval robustness under noisy supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed PCSR framework effectively handles noisy correspondences by leveraging pseudo-label consistency for sample refinement and adaptive optimization, significantly enhancing cross-modal retrieval performance in real-world noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated SAM framework for medical image segmentation that addresses privacy constraints and heterogeneous data challenges through parameter aggregation and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy constraints hinder medical data sharing across institutions, and existing federated learning approaches struggle with complex heterogeneous data. SAM's massive encoder poses challenges in federated settings.

Method: Integrates two key innovations: 1) personalized strategy aggregating only global parameters while retaining L-MoE for domain-specific features, 2) decoupled global-local fine-tuning using teacher-student knowledge distillation to bridge global and local models.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show significant improvement in segmentation performance, robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses federated learning challenges for SAM in medical image segmentation, achieving better performance and adaptation while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of pre-trained models in multimodal scenarios where both RGB-visible and infrared sensors are used, particularly for autonomous vehicles operating under diverse weather conditions.

Method: Proposes Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL) inspired by retinal horizontal cells' lateral inhibition, and a dual-knowledge preservation mechanism using LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Achieves superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+ of baseline performance on visible RGB tasks.

Conclusion: UNIV demonstrates effective cross-modal feature alignment and knowledge preservation, providing a robust solution for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception with biologically inspired mechanisms.

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

*Donghyun Lee,Dawoon Jeong,Jae W. Lee,Hongil Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Scale is a memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting that reduces GPU memory usage by 3.3-5.6x while maintaining comparable training speeds, enabling large-scale scene training on consumer GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes requires substantial GPU memory for parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which often exceeds available GPU memory capacity.

Method: GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory and transfers only subsets to GPU on demand. It uses three optimizations: selective geometric parameter offloading for fast frustum culling, parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and deferred optimizer updates for Gaussians with zero gradients.

Result: GS-Scale reduces GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x and enables scaling from 4 million to 18 million Gaussians on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, achieving 23-35% LPIPS improvement.

Conclusion: GS-Scale makes large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training feasible on consumer-grade GPUs by significantly reducing memory requirements while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for contactless fingerprint recognition by successfully applying 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective 3D registration and reconstruction that enhances recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

*Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A PCA-based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data that uses PCA-estimated normal information as a regularizer to guide reconstruction in missing data regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data often has incomplete coverage due to scanning limitations like high light-absorption and occlusions, making surface reconstruction challenging in data-missing regions.

Method: Uses PCA to estimate surface normal information from available point cloud data, then employs this as a regularizer in the reconstruction model. An operator-splitting method is introduced to solve the proposed model effectively.

Result: The model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and reconstructs underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.

Conclusion: The PCA-based approach with normal information regularization effectively addresses the challenge of surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

Method: Model each camera as a 3D Gaussian (camera splat), place virtual point cameras near surfaces to observe camera splat distributions, and continuously refine camera splats differentiably to achieve desired target distributions.

Result: The optimized views demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena compared to Farthest View Sampling, particularly for intense metallic reflections and intricate textures like text.

Conclusion: Camera Splatting provides an effective framework for novel view synthesis that excels at handling challenging view-dependent effects through differentiable optimization of camera representations.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.

*Sidra Hanif,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conditional diffusion model for handwriting stroke generation that incorporates multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation and word layout for consistent spacing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous handwriting stroke generation methods failed to properly imitate calligraphic styles due to inconsistent word spacing and lack of explicit consideration for word layout features.

Method: Proposes multi-scale attention features for local/global style imitation, incorporates word layout for spacing consistency, and uses a conditional diffusion model to generate strokes rather than images to preserve temporal coordinate information.

Result: The proposed diffusion model outperforms current state-of-the-art stroke generation methods and is competitive with recent image generation networks.

Conclusion: The inclusion of word layout and multi-scale style features in a conditional diffusion framework enables better handwriting imitation and stroke generation with improved calligraphic style consistency.

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and

### [54] [Saccadic Vision for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15688)
*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage fine-grained visual classification method inspired by human saccadic vision, using peripheral features and fixation patches with contextualized selective attention and non-maximum suppression to reduce spatial redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-based FGVC methods suffer from complex localization networks, limited feature utility, and high spatial redundancy in sampled points, making it difficult to determine optimal part numbers.

Method: Two-stage process: first extracts peripheral features and generates sample map, then samples fixation patches using non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundancy. Uses weight-shared encoder for parallel encoding and contextualized selective attention to weigh patch importance before fusing representations.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101, Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths, AMI-Moths), consistently outperforming baseline encoder.

Conclusion: The proposed saccadic vision-inspired approach effectively addresses spatial redundancy issues in part-based FGVC methods while maintaining competitive performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

*Cristian Sbrolli,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneForge enhances 3D-text contrastive learning by constructing multi-object scenes with spatial relations and pairing them with LLM-refined descriptions, addressing data scarcity and improving performance across various 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets and the need for better alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured compositional learning.

Method: Leverages individual 3D shapes to create multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairs them with coherent descriptions refined by large language models, and augments contrastive training with these compositional samples.

Result: Substantial performance gains across zero-shot classification, few-shot part segmentation, 3D visual question answering, and retrieval tasks; model-agnostic improvements across multiple encoder architectures.

Conclusion: SceneForge effectively enriches 3D-text data complexity and diversity, demonstrating robust generalization and spatial reasoning capabilities while being broadly applicable to various 3D understanding tasks.

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

### [56] [ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695)
*Zhaoyang Li,Zhan Ling,Yuchen Zhou,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ORIC, a benchmark to evaluate Large Vision-Language Models' object recognition capabilities in incongruous contexts where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when expected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are prone to errors in incongruous contexts, leading to object misidentification and hallucination, which limits their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: ORIC uses two strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify contextually incongruous but present objects, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to detect plausible but nonexistent objects likely to be hallucinated.

Result: Evaluation of 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models revealed significant recognition gaps, highlighting challenges with contextual incongruity.

Conclusion: The work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition to improve model robustness.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTP is a training-free token pruning strategy that reduces computational overhead in large vision-language models by selectively retaining tokens from visually salient regions using bottom-up visual saliency and top-down instruction guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models struggle with processing high-resolution images efficiently due to exponential computational overhead from increased visual tokens when partitioning images.

Method: Proposes Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP) that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at region/token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance, inspired by human visual attention mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 diverse benchmarks show substantial reduction in computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: PTP effectively addresses computational inefficiency in high-resolution image processing for LVLMs while maintaining performance through selective token retention based on visual saliency and task relevance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

*Chi Yang,Fu Wang,Xiaofei Yang,Hao Huang,Weijia Cao,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark dataset and baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into 3D cloud phase structures using deep learning models, with SGMAGNet achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction as they affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. The study aims to improve cloud microphysics parameterization in NWP systems.

Method: Uses multimodal satellite observations (VIS/TIR imagery from geostationary satellites and vertical cloud phase profiles from CALIOP/CALIPSO lidar and CPR/CloudSat radar) to create synchronized image-profile pairs. Adopts SGMAGNet and compares it with UNet variants and SegNet for multi-scale spatial pattern capture.

Result: SGMAGNet achieves superior performance with Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baseline models, especially in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, demonstrating SGMAGNet's effectiveness for operational cloud phase profile retrieval and potential integration with NWP systems.

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedForensics introduces a large-scale dataset and DSKI detector for identifying AI-generated medical images, addressing critical gaps in medical forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging creates risks like diagnostic deception and fraud, but existing forensic methods are inadequate for medical images and lack specialized datasets.

Method: Proposes DSKI (Dual-Stage Knowledge Infusing detector) with cross-domain fine-trace adapter for spatial/noise domain analysis and medical forensic retrieval module for few-shot detection enhancement.

Result: DSKI significantly outperforms existing methods and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical modalities.

Conclusion: The MedForensics dataset and DSKI detector provide effective solutions for detecting AI-generated medical images, addressing critical security needs in healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

*Laixin Zhang,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueMoE is a dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework for synthetic image detection that uses multiple specialized discriminative subspaces instead of a single universal space, achieving better generalization across diverse generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic image detection methods rely on single universal discriminative spaces that are complex, brittle, and struggle to generalize to unseen generative patterns, highlighting the need for more robust and adaptable detection frameworks.

Method: TrueMoE employs a Discriminative Expert Array organized along complementary axes of manifold structure and perceptual granularity, with a dual-routing mechanism (granularity-aware sparse router and manifold-aware dense router) that adaptively assigns input images to the most relevant experts for collaborative inference.

Result: Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior generalization and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework effectively addresses the limitations of single-space detection methods by leveraging multiple specialized subspaces, providing a more robust solution for synthetic image detection in the face of rapidly evolving generative models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

*Tony Lindeberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper derives mathematical relationships between receptive field responses at different scales and parameters, providing tools for more efficient computation and biological vision modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle variability in real-world image structures under natural transformations by establishing relationships between receptive field responses across different shape parameters and scales.

Method: Derives both infinitesimal relationships (combining semi-groups and Lie groups concepts) and macroscopic cascade smoothing properties (related to Lie algebras with directional preferences) for spatial and spatio-temporal receptive fields.

Result: Established mathematical relationships that enable understanding of how receptive field responses relate across different parameter values and scales.

Conclusion: The derived relationships provide deeper understanding of receptive field computations, enable more efficient multi-parameter family computations, and serve as idealized models for biological vision systems.

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details in building floor plan reconstruction from point cloud data.

Method: Uses grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement to create robust top-down density maps. Employs SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation with adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization.

Result: Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

Conclusion: FloorSAM framework successfully reconstructs accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy

*Zhengyang Yu,Arthur Aubret,Chen Yu,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modeling foveated vision (varying resolution from center to periphery) improves self-supervised learning of object representations from egocentric videos, making the learning process more biologically realistic and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning models ignore the foveated nature of human vision, which has high resolution in the center and low resolution in the periphery. This work investigates how incorporating this biological feature affects object representation learning.

Method: Used egocentric videos of human-object interactions, applied models of human foveation and cortical magnification to create inputs with decreasing resolution towards the periphery. Trained two bio-inspired self-supervised models with time-based learning objectives on these modified sequences.

Result: Foveated vision modeling improved the quality of learned object representations. Objects appeared bigger and there was a better trade-off between central and peripheral visual information.

Conclusion: Incorporating foveated vision aspects makes models of human visual learning more realistic and performant, representing a step forward in biologically-inspired computer vision.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

TL;DR: Introduces MCOD, the first multispectral benchmark dataset for camouflaged object detection, addressing limitations of RGB-only datasets and demonstrating the value of spectral information for improved detection robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based COD methods have limited performance under challenging conditions, and existing benchmark datasets lack support for multispectral approaches, which offer better foreground-background discrimination through rich spectral information.

Method: Created MCOD dataset with three key features: comprehensive challenge attributes (small objects, extreme lighting), diverse real-world scenarios, and high-quality pixel-level annotations. Benchmarked 11 representative COD methods on this new dataset.

Result: Observed consistent performance drop in existing methods due to increased task difficulty, but integration of multispectral modalities substantially alleviated this degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information.

Conclusion: MCOD provides a strong foundation for future multispectral COD research and demonstrates that spectral information enhances detection robustness. The dataset is publicly available to advance the field.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of ecological studies by integrating AI for automated plant species identification in plot images, enabling standardized sampling, biodiversity assessment, and large-scale monitoring.

Method: The challenge uses a multi-label classification task where participants predict all plant species in high-resolution plot images, leveraging a training set of 1.7 million individual plant images and pre-trained vision transformer models.

Result: The paper details the data, evaluation methodology, participant methods, and results, but specific performance metrics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The PlantCLEF 2024 challenge aims to advance AI capabilities in ecological research by providing a robust framework for multi-label plant species identification, facilitating broader and more efficient ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants

TL;DR: VLM3D improves text-to-3D generation by integrating vision-language models into Score Distillation Sampling, addressing semantic alignment and 3D consistency limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDS-based methods have two key limitations: (1) CLIP-style text encoders provide coarse semantic alignment and struggle with fine-grained prompts, and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, leading to geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships.

Method: VLM3D integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. It leverages Qwen2.5-VL model to provide rich language-grounded supervision and inherent spatial understanding for better 3D consistency and relational reasoning.

Result: Experiments on GPTeval3D benchmark show VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness across diverse objects and complex scenes.

Conclusion: VLM3D successfully addresses fundamental limitations of existing text-to-3D generation methods by incorporating VLMs as semantic and spatial priors, enabling fine-grained prompt alignment and improved 3D consistency.

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods: Cutie has feature capacity constraints and SAM2 lacks temporal modeling, while both have complementary strengths for video object segmentation.

Method: Replace Cutie's encoder with SAM2's pretrained ViT encoder, introduce motion prediction module for temporal stability, and use ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and the proposed variant.

Result: Achieved 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge, demonstrating robust video object segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The framework shows effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion prediction for video object segmentation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We

### [68] [Ideal Registration? Segmentation is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15784)
*Xiang Chen,Fengting Zhang,Qinghao Liu,Min Liu,Kun Wu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg is a segmentation-driven registration framework that uses anatomically adaptive regularization to handle regionally varying deformations in medical image registration, outperforming existing methods by 2-12% across clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning registration methods use globally uniform smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate complex, regionally varying anatomical deformations, limiting their effectiveness in medical image registration.

Method: SegReg decomposes input images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation, processes these localized domains with the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, and integrates them into a global deformation field.

Result: SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23% Dice on critical anatomies) with ground-truth segmentation and outperforms existing methods by 2-12% across cardiac, abdominal, and lung registration scenarios even with automatic segmentation.

Conclusion: SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on segmentation quality, effectively transforming the registration challenge into a segmentation problem, with promising results for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

*Runjie Shao,Boyu Diao,Zijia An,Ruiqi Liu,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBPNet addresses plasticity loss in continual learning by adaptively reinitializing underutilized parameters in frozen pretrained models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat plasticity loss in continual learning where frozen pretrained models with prompts lose learning ability due to underutilized parameters, especially for edge devices requiring real-time responses.

Method: Proposes Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet) with an Efficient CBP Block that adaptively reinitializes underutilized parameters to restore learning vitality.

Result: Achieves 69.41% accuracy on Split ImageNet-R (state-of-the-art) and over 1% improvement on Split CIFAR-100, using less than 0.2% additional parameters of backbone size.

Conclusion: CBPNet effectively restores model plasticity in continual learning with high parameter efficiency, making it suitable for edge device applications.

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

*Haotian Zhang,Han Guo,Keyan Chen,Hao Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LevirSCD, a new benchmark dataset for remote sensing semantic change detection with more comprehensive change categories and fine-grained class definitions, and proposes FoBa, a foreground-background co-guided method with Gated Interaction Fusion module that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing SCD datasets (limited categories, insufficient change types, lack of fine-grained definitions) and methodological issues where change information is underutilized as post-processing rather than integrated into the model architecture.

Method: Proposes FoBa method that uses foreground-background co-guidance to collaboratively guide the model, with Gated Interaction Fusion (GIF) module for bi-temporal interaction and consistency loss for spatial consistency enhancement.

Result: FoBa achieves competitive results on three datasets (SECOND, JL1, and LevirSCD) with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%, and 2.81% in SeK metric respectively compared to current SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LevirSCD dataset and FoBa method effectively address data and methodological limitations in remote sensing SCD, demonstrating superior performance through comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

*Tan Pan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Zhaorui Tan,Chen Jiang,Deshu Chen,Xin Guo,Brian C. Lovell,Limei Han,Yuan Cheng,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MS-UDG, a method for Unsupervised Domain Generalization that learns Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representations by optimizing for sufficiency (preserving semantic information) and minimality (removing irrelevant variations), achieving state-of-the-art performance without category or domain labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain generalization methods often rely on domain labels which are unavailable in real-world scenarios. There's a need for approaches that can distinguish semantics from variations without supervision.

Method: MS-UDG integrates: (1) InfoNCE-based objective for sufficiency, (2) semantic-variation disentanglement loss, and (3) reconstruction-based mechanism for minimality, grounded in information theory principles.

Result: MS-UDG achieves state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods.

Conclusion: The proposed minimal sufficient semantic representation framework effectively addresses UDG challenges without requiring category or domain labels, demonstrating strong theoretical grounding and practical performance.

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Hanzhang Chi,Qi Zhang,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASAM extends SAM for remote sensing by adding terrain, temporal, and multi-scale modules, achieving better performance than zero-shot SAM and task-specific models without retraining the backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with remote sensing data due to complex terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics, requiring domain-specific adaptation.

Method: Integrates three lightweight modules: terrain-aware adapter for elevation priors, temporal prompt generator for land-cover changes, and multi-scale fusion for fine-grained object delineation.

Result: Substantial performance gains on LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD benchmarks, outperforming zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive augmentation is valuable for foundation models, providing a scalable path for robust geospatial segmentation.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

TL;DR: ChronoForge-RL is a novel video understanding framework that addresses computational inefficiency and poor frame selection through Temporal Apex Distillation and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods struggle with computational infeasibility of processing every frame and difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies.

Method: Combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) for differentiable keyframe selection using variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation, and KF-GRPO which implements contrastive learning with saliency-enhanced reward mechanism to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships.

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL effectively addresses computational and semantic challenges in video understanding through intelligent frame selection and temporal reasoning, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models exhibit significant 'brand bias' - generating content featuring dominant commercial brands from generic prompts, which poses ethical and legal risks that need to be addressed.

Method: CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives through prompt refinement, avoiding the need for model retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit brand biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal, as measured by the proposed Brand Neutrality Score (BNS).

Conclusion: CIDER offers a practical solution for more original and equitable content generation, contributing to the development of trustworthy generative AI by effectively mitigating brand bias issues.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Xiaoying Liao,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Active Learning method using knowledge transfer between teacher and student models for uncertainty estimation, suitable for various tasks including cryo-ET classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods in Active Learning require complex auxiliary models and advanced training techniques that are difficult to train, especially for domain-specific tasks like cryo-ET classification.

Method: Proposes a teacher-student framework where the teacher is the task model and the student is an auxiliary model that learns from the teacher. Both models are trained simultaneously in each AL cycle, using distance between their outputs to measure uncertainty for unlabeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges demonstrate the method's efficacy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge transfer approach provides an effective and efficient uncertainty estimation method for Active Learning that is task-agnostic and doesn't rely on special training techniques.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

*Johannes Leonhardt,Juergen Gall,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC-SLab is a deep learning framework for object-based land cover classification that addresses fragmentation issues in sparse supervision scenarios, outperforming pixel-wise models while producing more coherent maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning land cover mapping approaches using sparse in-situ datasets lead to fragmented and noisy predictions. Object-based classification offers potential but remains underexplored, especially for medium-resolution imagery with sparse supervision.

Method: LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks and output-level aggregation by postprocessing semantic segmentation results. It incorporates features from large pre-trained networks to improve small dataset performance.

Result: Object-based methods match or exceed pixel-wise model accuracy while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation is more robust on smaller datasets, while output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations outperform existing land cover products.

Conclusion: LC-SLab demonstrates the practical utility of object-based deep learning for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision, offering a systematic framework to explore tradeoffs between accuracy and fragmentation.

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DVG methods struggle with implicit spatial texture representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting and require extensive labeled data and per-scene training, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed GVR framework leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding clues from multiple views, transforming 3D visual grounding into a 2D retrieval task that avoids costly 3D annotations and per-scene training.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GVR achieves state-of-the-art visual grounding performance while eliminating the need for per-scene training, demonstrating superior zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: GVR provides a solid foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research by offering an efficient framework that avoids the limitations of traditional methods, making 3D visual grounding more practical for real-world applications like robotics.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid

Conclusion: ENSAM demonstrates that effective 3D medical image segmentation is achievable with limited resources. Relative positional encodings and Muon optimizer significantly improve convergence and segmentation quality, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a

ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossI2P is a self-supervised framework for image-to-point cloud registration that bridges 2D-3D modality gaps through cross-modal learning and coarse-to-fine registration, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-to-point cloud registration is challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich images and sparse point clouds, and existing methods often converge to local optima.

Method: Uses dual-path contrastive learning for geometric-semantic fusion, coarse-to-fine registration with superpoint-superpixel correspondences, and dynamic training with gradient normalization for balanced optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on KITTI Odometry and 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: CrossI2P effectively bridges 2D-3D sensor modalities through unified cross-modal learning and two-stage registration, demonstrating superior performance in autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap is a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning that addresses limitations in fine-grained relation modeling by mining structured relation semantics from retrieval captions and identifying heterogeneous objects from images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented image captioning methods have challenges in relation modeling: coarse-grained semantic prompts that fail to capture fine-grained relationships, and lack of explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships.

Method: RACap mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions and identifies heterogeneous objects from the image, effectively retrieving structured relation features containing heterogeneous visual information to enhance semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.

Result: RACap achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models with only 10.8M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed RACap model successfully addresses relation modeling limitations in image captioning by incorporating structured relation features and heterogeneous object identification, demonstrating effective performance with a lightweight architecture.

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 (Visual Foundation Model) for LiDAR point cloud segmentation, achieving competitive performance on SemanticKITTI with improved speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques and Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for fast and accurate LiDAR point cloud segmentation, addressing the computational limitations of voxel- and point-based methods.

Method: Adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation through architectural modifications: (1) novel module for horizontal spatial dependencies in LiDAR range images, (2) customized configuration for spherical projections, and (3) adapted mechanism for range-view spatial patterns and discontinuities.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines.

Conclusion: Range-view segmentation methods using VFMs lead to promising results, highlighting the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opening a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation.

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

*Jiahao Li,Xinhong Chen,Zhengmin Jiang,Qian Zhou,Yung-Hui Li,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GREAT-Stereo framework enhances iterative stereo matching methods by incorporating global context through three attention modules to address challenges in ill-posed regions like occlusions and textureless areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative stereo matching methods struggle in ill-posed regions due to lack of global context and geometric information for effective refinement.

Method: Proposes GREAT framework with three attention modules: Spatial Attention (SA) for global spatial context, Matching Attention (MA) for epipolar line context, and Volume Attention (VA) to build robust cost-volume using global context and geometric details.

Result: GREAT-IGEV ranks first on Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and second on Middlebury benchmark among published methods.

Conclusion: The GREAT framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging regions and shows universality when integrated into various iterative stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

TL;DR: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are stateful neural networks with feedback mechanisms that enable iterative refinement of internal states, outperforming feedforward networks in noisy and data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce dynamics into static neural architectures by mimicking biological decision making processes through feedback mechanisms, aiming for more robust and generalizable learning.

Method: Model the feedback process as a differential equation solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to ensure convergence. Evaluated on object recognition and segmentation tasks under noise and limited data conditions.

Result: DFMs consistently outperform feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes, and demonstrate robustness in medical imaging settings against various noise corruptions.

Conclusion: Feedback mechanisms are crucial for achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning in neural networks, with DFMs showing superior performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary 3D object detection using 2D foundation models for sparse-view settings


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object detection is limited to fixed categories and requires dense input views. There's a need for open-vocabulary detection that works with limited posed RGB images.

Method: Lifting 2D detections from pre-trained models and optimizing 3D proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, without 3D feature fusion or 3D-specific learning

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art in dense scenarios, and significantly outperforms them in sparse-view settings

Conclusion: Simple pipeline leveraging 2D foundation models establishes powerful baseline for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, especially effective in sparse-view conditions

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

TL;DR: Novel camera-radar fusion method for 3D object detection using BEV representation with optimized radar processing and simplified architecture for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-radar fusion provides robust, low-cost 3D detection under adverse conditions, but current methods don't fully exploit radar advantages like accurate distance estimation and speed information.

Method: Introduces new backbone for radar pillar feature mapping with self-attention mechanism, replaces FPN-based convolutional layers with simplified convolutional layer for faster inference in BEV representation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 58.2 NDS metric using ResNet-50 and sets new benchmark for inference time on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively exploits radar advantages while maintaining efficiency, establishing new performance standards for camera-radar fusion in 3D object detection.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Motivation: Climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by affecting weather, soil, and management factors. Current methods struggle with multi-spectral data crucial for evaluating crop health, necessitating better integration of spectral and spatio-temporal information.

Method: Proposes MTMS-YieldNet that uses contrastive learning for feature discrimination during pre-training to capture spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing data, rather than relying on pre-trained models trained on general visual data.

Result: MTMS-YieldNet outperforms seven existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8, and 0.331 on Sentinel-2 across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions.

Conclusion: The method provides effective yield prediction performance and valuable insights to assist farmers in decision-making, potentially improving crop yields and contributing to agricultural sustainability.

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores explainable AI methods for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) networks, evaluating Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different MDE models and introducing Attribution Fidelity as a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI is crucial for understanding deep learning models, but MDE explainability remains largely unexplored despite its real-world applications. The authors aim to analyze how MDE networks map input images to depth maps using established explainability methods.

Method: The study investigates feature attribution methods (Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, Attention Rollout) on MDE models (METER and PixelFormer). They assess explanation quality by perturbing relevant/irrelevant pixels and introduce Attribution Fidelity metric to evaluate explanation reliability by measuring consistency with predicted depth maps.

Result: Experimental results show Saliency Maps perform well for lightweight MDE models, while Integrated Gradients work better for deep models. Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies when explainability methods produce unreliable visual maps, even when conventional metrics show satisfactory results.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that different explainability methods suit different MDE model complexities, and Attribution Fidelity provides a more reliable evaluation metric for visual explanations in depth estimation tasks.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-vehicle perception instability in trajectory prediction by enabling cooperative prediction through multi-source data fusion from vehicles and infrastructure.

Method: Uses Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering for early fusion, Past Time Attention (PTA) module for interaction capture, mode attention module for prediction diversity, and anchor-oriented decoder for trajectory generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, demonstrating high completeness and accuracy in cooperative trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: CoPAD effectively addresses V2X cooperative trajectory prediction challenges and validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods often blur depth at object boundaries, creating spurious 3D points, while achieving sharp edges typically requires fine-grained supervision.

Method: Models per-pixel depth as a mixture distribution to capture multiple plausible depths, shifting uncertainty from direct regression to mixture weights. Integrates into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions and uncertainty propagation.

Result: Achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improved point cloud quality on KITTI and VKITTIv2 datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The method successfully produces crisp depth discontinuities using only self-supervision, demonstrating effective boundary-aware depth estimation without requiring fine-grained supervision.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuproCL is a novel framework that addresses limitations of single-target language guidance in visual continual learning by using multiple context-aware prototypes generated through LLM-based category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single semantic targets from pretrained language models cause semantic ambiguity (polysemous category names) and fail to capture intra-class visual diversity, limiting effectiveness in visual continual learning.

Method: Uses lightweight LLM agent for category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate multiple semantic prototypes, with LogSumExp aggregation for adaptive alignment between vision model and relevant prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments show MuproCL consistently enhances performance and robustness across various continual learning baselines.

Conclusion: MuproCL establishes a more effective path for language-guided continual learning by replacing single targets with multiple context-aware prototypes.

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal image matching is challenging due to significant appearance differences between modalities. Existing deep learning methods perform poorly due to limited annotated datasets and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation to build lightweight student model extracting high-level semantic features from VFMs. Injects modality category information to retain modality-specific details. Employs V2I-GAN for visible-to-infrared translation for data augmentation.

Result: Experiments show DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses multimodal matching challenges by leveraging VFM knowledge distillation and modality-specific information injection, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

TL;DR: CauMVC is a causal multi-view clustering network that addresses the challenge of partially aligned data across views by modeling it as an intervention and using variational auto-encoders for invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view clustering methods assume fully aligned data across views, but real-world scenarios often have only partial alignment, which degrades clustering performance. The paper aims to solve this generalized multi-view clustering problem.

Method: Proposes CauMVC using causal modeling: formulates partially aligned data as intervention, uses Variational Auto-Encoder with encoder for invariant feature estimation and decoder for post-intervention inference, plus contrastive regularizer for sample correlations.

Result: Empirical experiments show CauMVC has strong generalization and effectiveness on both fully and partially aligned data.

Conclusion: This is the first work to address generalized multi-view clustering via causal learning, successfully handling data order shift from fully to partially aligned scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

*Tianyue Wang,Shuang Yang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip is a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework for robust visual speech recognition that addresses real-world visual challenges like illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes through a dual-path feature extraction and two-stage progressive learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing VSR methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. The paper aims to create a more robust VSR system that can handle these adverse conditions effectively.

Method: GLip uses a dual-path feature extraction architecture integrating global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. Stage 1 learns coarse alignment between visual features and speech units using audio-visual data. Stage 2 introduces a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with global context across spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: The framework demonstrates enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforms existing methods on LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. It also shows effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.

Conclusion: GLip's progressive learning strategy that exploits discriminative local regions provides a robust solution for visual speech recognition in challenging real-world conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Motivation: Existing surface reconstruction methods rely heavily on ground truth normals or approximate normals, making them unreliable for noisy point clouds. B-spline methods have smoothing properties but use fixed control points that can't match surface complexity.

Method: Developed a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network that simultaneously predicts both the location and number of control points for B-spline surface reconstruction from noisy point clouds, eliminating the need for point normals.

Result: The method outperforms several well-known and recent baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively across widely-used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generates smooth surfaces from noisy point clouds without normals by adaptively determining control point placement and quantity, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: LIR-GAD is a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Group Activity Detection, introducing special tokens and language instructions to enhance contextual reasoning and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for GAD rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. The authors aim to leverage MLLMs' commonsense knowledge to improve these aspects.

Method: The approach expands MLLM vocabulary with activity-level <ACT> tokens and cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens, processes video frames with language instructions, uses multi-label classification loss, and integrates embeddings with visual features via a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion module.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate superior performance in Group Activity Detection tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LIR-GAD framework effectively leverages MLLMs' commonsense knowledge to improve group activity detection through language-instructed reasoning, achieving better performance and enhanced explainability.

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE&TREK is a training-free prompting framework that enhances spatial understanding in MLLMs using visual diversity and motion reconstruction techniques without requiring additional training or GPU resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on additional modalities like depth or point clouds, but purely visual spatial understanding remains underexplored in Multimodal Large Language Models under vision-only constraints.

Method: Uses Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling to extract semantically rich keyframes for visual diversity, and simulates visual trajectories with encoded relative spatial positions for motion reconstruction. The method is training-free and requires only a single forward pass.

Result: Extensive experiments on VSI-BENCH and STI-BENCH show consistent performance improvements across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, with up to +3.5% improvement over baseline MLLMs.

Conclusion: SEE&TREK offers a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence in MLLMs through training-free visual prompting techniques that enhance spatial understanding without additional modalities.

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

TL;DR: Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion (BSGD) is a self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising that combines blind-spot networks with diffusion models to overcome limitations of both approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of blind-spot networks (which sacrifice local detail and cause pixel discontinuities) and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising without paired training data.

Method: Dual-branch diffusion framework with BSN-based diffusion branch generating semi-clean images and conventional diffusion branch capturing noise distributions. Uses BSN-based branch to guide sampling process for effective training without paired data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SIDD and DND datasets, demonstrating highly effective self-supervised denoising for real-world images.

Conclusion: BSGD establishes an effective self-supervised solution for real-world image denoising by successfully combining blind-spot networks and diffusion models to preserve local details while capturing noise structure.

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj is an adaptive trajectory modeling framework for multi-agent sports scenarios that addresses distribution discrepancies across agent roles and sports domains using role- and domain-aware adapters with hierarchical contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified frameworks fail to capture structured distributional shifts across different agent roles (players vs. ball) and sports domains, leading to suboptimal generalization in trajectory prediction.

Method: Proposes AdaSports-Traj with Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations, and Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective to separately supervise role-sensitive and domain-aware representations for disentangled latent structures.

Result: Experiments on Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U datasets demonstrate strong performance in both unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

Conclusion: The adaptive design effectively addresses intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

*Jinyuan Qu,Hongyang Li,Xingyu Chen,Shilong Liu,Yukai Shi,Tianhe Ren,Ruitao Jing,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO3D is a Transformer encoder-decoder framework for 3D instance segmentation that leverages 2D pre-trained detection models to improve 3D representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D training data is generally insufficient compared to 2D images, so the paper aims to leverage rich 2D representations from pre-trained 2D detection models to enhance 3D instance segmentation performance.

Method: The framework takes point clouds and associated 2D images as input. It enriches 3D points with 2D image features, uses a 3D encoder for context fusion, and performs cross-attention between 3D anchor box queries and 2D object queries from pre-trained models to avoid memory issues while preserving 2D knowledge.

Result: SegDINO3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 benchmarks, with significant improvements of +8.7 and +6.8 mAP on ScanNet200 validation and test sets respectively compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages 2D pre-trained models to overcome 3D data scarcity, demonstrating superior 3D instance segmentation performance through effective cross-modal representation learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

*Weiyi Xiong,Bing Zhu,Tao Huang,Zewei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadarGaussianDet3D is a novel 4D radar-based 3D detector that uses Gaussian primitives and distributions to overcome limitations of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with faster inference for real-time autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors suffer from sparse feature maps due to pillar encoders, sub-optimal detection accuracy from independent bounding box optimization, and insufficient inference speed for vehicle-mounted embedded devices.

Method: Proposes RadarGaussianDet3D with Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) that transforms points into Gaussian primitives using 3D Gaussian Splatting for BEV rasterization, and Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) that converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions for more comprehensive optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy with substantially faster inference speeds compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D shows great potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving by addressing key limitations of current 4D radar detectors through Gaussian-based representations and efficient algorithms.

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) through exhaustive experimental analysis, introducing BaseReward as a new SOTA baseline that outperforms previous models on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge, but there's currently no systematic guide for building effective Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) in both academia and industry.

Method: The paper systematically investigates crucial components in MRM development including reward modeling paradigms, reward head architecture, training strategies, data curation, backbone model and scale, and ensemble methods. Based on these insights, they introduce BaseReward - a simple yet effective architecture built on Qwen2.5-VL backbone with optimized two-layer reward head, trained on curated multimodal and text-only preference data.

Result: BaseReward establishes new SOTA on major benchmarks (MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, Multimodal Reward Bench) and successfully enhances MLLM performance across perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks when integrated into real-world reinforcement learning pipelines.

Conclusion: This work delivers not only a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable 3D scene reconstruction from sparse measurements using commercially available time-of-flight sensors that offer low spatial resolution but rich time-resolved photon count data

Method: Combines feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters with differentiable rendering in an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine parameter estimates

Result: Successfully recovers object pose given untextured 3D models in both simulations and real-world captures, showing promising results for parametric scenes with as few as 15 pixels

Conclusion: The method demonstrates feasibility of using distributed sparse measurements for 3D geometry recovery, with experiments exploring the limits and capabilities of this imaging approach

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AcT2I, a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Image models on action-centric prompts, and proposes a training-free knowledge distillation technique using LLMs to enhance prompts with temporal details, achieving 72% improvement in image generation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models struggle with accurately rendering complex scenes involving actions and interactions, often missing nuanced and implicit attributes in action depiction, leading to images lacking key contextual details.

Method: Developed AcT2I benchmark for systematic evaluation, then created a training-free knowledge distillation technique using Large Language Models to enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, with temporal details proving most effective.

Result: Leading T2I models performed poorly on AcT2I, but the proposed prompt enhancement method significantly improved image generation accuracy, with the best model achieving a 72% increase in accuracy.

Conclusion: Current T2I methods have limitations in generating images requiring complex reasoning, but systematically integrating linguistic knowledge through prompt enhancement can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs exhibit visual sycophantic behavior (agreeing with misleading user instructions), which is more pronounced than in text-based LLMs. The paper proposes Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT) to reduce this behavior without making models overly stubborn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pronounced visual sycophantic behavior in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) where they excessively agree with misleading image-based user instructions, creating a 'sycophantic modality gap' that is more severe than in text-only models.

Method: Proposed Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables MLLMs to engage in reflective reasoning to determine whether user instructions are misleading or corrective before drawing conclusions, addressing limitations of naive supervised fine-tuning that made models overly resistant.

Result: SRT significantly reduced sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions without causing excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions, effectively mitigating the visual sycophantic modality gap.

Conclusion: The sycophantic modality gap is a significant issue in MLLMs, and the proposed SRT method successfully addresses this problem by enabling reflective reasoning, balancing the need to resist misleading instructions while remaining open to corrective feedback.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: A lightweight defense method using tensor decomposition to protect vision language models from adversarial attacks without requiring retraining or architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are costly (require retraining) or require significant architecture modifications.

Method: Uses tensor decomposition and reconstruction of vision encoder representations to filter adversarial noise while preserving semantic meaning. Specifically employs Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength (α=0.1-0.2).

Result: On Flickr30K: restores 12.3% performance lost to attacks, improving Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5% to 19.8%. On COCO: recovers 8.1% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8% to 11.9%.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, plug-and-play defense solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs, making it suitable for deployment without costly modifications.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMRSeg is a unified modality-relax segmentation network that handles incomplete/corrupted multi-modal inputs through hierarchical self-supervised compensation, eliminating the need for specialized models per modality combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal segmentation methods require exhaustive model subsets for different modality combinations, leading to high deployment costs. The goal is to create a single unified model that works robustly with any combination of available modalities.

Method: Uses hierarchical self-supervised compensation across three levels: 1) modality reconstruction with hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, 2) modality-invariant contrastive learning for feature space alignment, and 3) lightweight reverse attention adapter for weak perceptual semantics compensation. Fine-tuned under hybrid consistency constraint.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios across multiple tasks including MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, and RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

Conclusion: UniMRSeg provides a unified solution for multi-modal segmentation that is robust to missing modalities, reducing deployment costs while maintaining high performance across various real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optimized Otsu thresholding using bisection method reduces computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) while maintaining segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional Otsu algorithm suffers from computational inefficiency due to exhaustive search across all possible threshold values, limiting its use in real-time applications.

Method: Leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function, reducing the number of required evaluations.

Result: 91.63% reduction in variance computations, 97.21% reduction in iterations, exact threshold matches in 66.67% of cases, and 95.83% within 5 gray level deviations.

Conclusion: The optimized algorithm maintains segmentation quality while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications, addressing computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing.

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Manzano is a unified multimodal LLM framework that reduces performance trade-offs between visual understanding and generation through a hybrid image tokenizer and unified training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source multimodal LLMs suffer from performance trade-offs between visual understanding and generation capabilities, creating a need for a unified solution that excels at both.

Method: Uses a shared vision encoder with lightweight adapters producing continuous embeddings for understanding and discrete tokens for generation. Combines autoregressive LLM for semantic prediction with auxiliary diffusion decoder for pixel generation, trained jointly on understanding and generation data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, competitive with specialist models, especially on text-rich evaluation. Shows minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size.

Conclusion: The hybrid tokenizer design is validated as effective for scalable joint learning of multimodal understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.
