*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a latent-noise autoencoder reduces re-identification risk while maintaining data usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect users' sensitive gaze data from re-identification without consent while preserving its utility for benign tasks.

Method: Uses a latent-noise autoencoder to anonymize gaze signals, balancing privacy and utility.

Result: Significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility degradation, retaining physiologically plausible gaze patterns.

Conclusion: The framework effectively protects gaze data privacy while ensuring usability, advancing privacy in gaze-based systems.

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys video temporal grounding (VTG) using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), highlighting their advantages over traditional methods and proposing a taxonomy for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive reviews on VTG-MLLMs despite their growing impact in video understanding.

Method: Systematic review using a three-dimensional taxonomy: functional roles of MLLMs, training paradigms, and video feature processing techniques.

Result: Identifies competitive performance and generalization strengths of VTG-MLLMs, along with benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations and suggests future research directions, with additional resources provided in a repository.

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF (Value Sign Flip) is a method for negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion models, outperforming existing techniques like CFG by flipping attention values from negative prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CFG, NASA, and NAG are inefficient for negative prompt guidance in few-step models. VSF aims to dynamically suppress undesired content with minimal overhead.

Method: VSF flips the sign of attention values from negative prompts, integrating with architectures like Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo and cross-attention models.

Result: VSF improves negative prompt adherence in few-step models and even outperforms CFG in non-few-step models while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: VSF is a simple, efficient solution for negative prompt guidance, validated on complex datasets and tasks, with code available for public use.

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [4] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs) to Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and proposes a re-localization scheme to refine Absolute Pose Regression (APR) predictions using PAE-based RPR, improving accuracy without extra data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate camera localization is vital for retail applications like customer experience and inventory management. While APR is promising, incorporating visual and spatial priors (via PAEs) boosts accuracy.

Method: Extends PAEs to RPR and introduces a re-localization scheme refining APR predictions with PAE-based RPR, avoiding additional data storage. Compares PAE-based RPR with image-based RPR and validates refinement on indoor benchmarks.

Result: PAE-based RPR outperforms equivalent image-based RPR models. The refinement enhances APR accuracy, achieving competitive performance with only 30% of training data, reducing data collection efforts.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves camera localization accuracy in retail settings, requiring less training data and no extra storage, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [5] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)
*Jiahui Huang,Qunjie Zhou,Hesam Rabeti,Aleksandr Korovko,Huan Ling,Xuanchi Ren,Tianchang Shen,Jun Gao,Dmitry Slepichev,Chen-Hsuan Lin,Jiawei Ren,Kevin Xie,Joydeep Biswas,Laura Leal-Taixe,Sanja Fidler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE is a video processing engine for estimating camera intrinsics, motion, and depth from raw videos, outperforming baselines and enabling large-scale 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos is challenging; ViPE addresses this gap.

Method: ViPE estimates camera intrinsics, motion, and dense depth from diverse videos, supporting various camera models.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI, runs at 3-5FPS, and annotates 96M frames from 100K+ videos.

Conclusion: ViPE and its open-source dataset aim to accelerate spatial AI development.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-OV3D improves open-vocabulary 3D detection by generating high-quality pseudo-labels with geometric precision, outperforming existing methods by 7.37% mAP on novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed-set 3D detection lacks adaptability for open-world applications, and existing open-vocabulary methods neglect geometric quality in pseudo-labels.

Method: HQ-OV3D uses an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated Proposal Generator for initial high-quality 3D proposals and an Annotated-Class Assisted Denoiser for refinement via DDIM-based denoising.

Result: The framework achieves a 7.37% mAP improvement on novel classes compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D is effective as both a standalone detector and a pseudo-label generator for open-vocabulary pipelines.

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting method for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, improving accuracy and reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of dense 3D voxels and 2D planar features in collaborative perception, which incur high costs or require additional supervision.

Method: Uses sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting, sharing and fusing Gaussian primitives for cross-agent fusion, joint geometry-semantics encoding, and sparse object-centric messaging.

Result: Outperforms single-agent and baseline collaborative methods by significant margins in mIoU and IoU, with reduced communication volume.

Conclusion: The method is effective for collaborative perception, offering robust performance even under limited communication budgets.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IDFSR, a novel FSR method for extreme degradation scenarios, enhancing ID restoration and reducing hallucination by decoupling and fitting identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSR methods struggle with ID consistency and realism under extreme degradation (e.g., scale > 8×), often producing hallucinated faces.

Method: IDFSR uses masking, warping, and ID embeddings from GT images to decouple style and ID, pretrains a diffusion model, and fine-tunes ID embeddings for personalized adaptation.

Result: IDFSR outperforms existing methods in ID consistency and perceptual quality under extreme degradation.

Conclusion: IDFSR effectively addresses extreme FSR challenges, improving ID restoration and reducing hallucination.

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

*Tianyu Song,Van-Doan Duong,Thi-Phuong Le,Ton Viet Ta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning automates wood species classification with high accuracy, using lightweight models like ShuffleNetV2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wood species identification is labor-intensive and expert-dependent, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Evaluated five CNN architectures on a custom dataset of Vietnamese wood species.

Result: ShuffleNetV2 achieved 99.29% accuracy and 99.35% F1-score, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Lightweight deep learning models enable real-time, high-accuracy species identification in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NIRMAL Pooling is a new CNN pooling layer combining adaptive max pooling and non-linear activation, showing improved accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CNN performance by integrating adaptive pooling with non-linear activation for better feature expressiveness.

Method: NIRMAL Pooling dynamically adjusts pooling parameters and applies ReLU activation post-pooling.

Result: Outperforms Max Pooling on MNIST Digits (99.25%), MNIST Fashion (91.59%), and CIFAR-10 (70.49%).

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling is a flexible, reliable alternative to traditional pooling, improving CNN performance in image recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [11] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature descriptor for detecting Artcodes, decorative markers blending virtual and real elements, and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With smartphones and VR/AR becoming ubiquitous, detecting objects like Artcodes that link virtual elements is crucial for interaction and digital material access.

Method: The study introduces a new feature descriptor, the shape of orientation histogram, to classify Artcodes by their topological structure, and evaluates it with collected datasets.

Result: Experiments confirm the descriptor's feasibility for representing topological structures and the system's effectiveness in detecting Artcodes.

Conclusion: This work pioneers feature-based detection of topological objects like Artcodes, enabling new interaction possibilities and applications.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

*Christian Düreth,Jan Condé-Wolter,Marek Danczak,Karsten Tittmann,Jörn Jaschinski,Andreas Hornig,Maik Gude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using low-resolution CT and 3D-UNet quantifies nesting in textile composites, achieving high accuracy in segmentation and analysis of structural features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nesting in textile-reinforced composites is crucial for modeling mechanical properties like stiffness and damage tolerance.

Method: In-situ compaction experiments with CT scans (20.22 µm/voxel) and 3D-UNet segmentation analyzed using two-point correlation function.

Result: Achieved 0.822 IoU and 0.902 F1 score; validated with micrographs, showing strong agreement.

Conclusion: The method robustly extracts key features from CT data, enabling reverse modeling and structural analysis of composites.

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

TL;DR: iWatchRoad is an automated system for pothole detection, GPS tagging, and real-time mapping using dashcam footage and YOLO, tailored for Indian road conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Potholes pose safety and maintenance challenges, especially in India's diverse and under-maintained roads.

Method: Uses a YOLO model fine-tuned on a self-annotated dataset of 7,000 frames, with OCR for timestamp extraction and GPS synchronization for geotagging. Data is stored and visualized via OSM.

Result: Achieves real-time pothole detection with high accuracy under challenging conditions, providing actionable outputs for road maintenance.

Conclusion: iWatchRoad is a cost-effective, scalable solution for road management in developing regions.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

### [14] [IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10946)
*Wonho Lee,Hyunsik Na,Jisu Lee,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPG efficiently generates adversarial patches, outperforming existing methods by 11.1x, and demonstrates strong attack performance and generalization. It also aids in building robust AI models for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patches challenge AI model robustness, especially in computer vision. Existing methods are inefficient, prompting the need for a better solution like IPG.

Method: Proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), validated through experiments, ablation studies, and YOLO feature visualization.

Result: IPG is 11.1x more efficient, produces generalized patches, and supports robust model construction.

Conclusion: IPG shows promise for adversarial defense and real-world applications like autonomous vehicles and medical imaging.

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

### [15] [MedAtlas: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Round, Multi-Task Medical Reasoning Across Diverse Imaging Modalities and Clinical Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10947)
*Ronghao Xu,Zhen Huang,Yangbo Wei,Xiaoqian Zhou,Zikang Xu,Ting Liu,Zihang Jiang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedAtlas is a benchmark framework for evaluating large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks, featuring multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks lack multi-modal integration and longitudinal interaction, limiting their realism for clinical decision-making.

Method: MedAtlas introduces four core tasks (open/closed-ended QA, multi-image reasoning, disease diagnosis) with real-world cases, expert annotations, and novel metrics (Round Chain Accuracy, Error Propagation Resistance).

Result: Benchmarking shows significant performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning among existing models.

Conclusion: MedAtlas advances robust medical AI by providing a challenging, realistic evaluation platform.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net, a deep learning framework, enhances Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) from clinical MRI data, outperforming predecessors in speed and accuracy, validated across healthy and neurological disorder subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating reliable FODs from low-quality clinical MRI data and validate deep learning methods for clinical adoption.

Method: FastFOD-Net, an accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework, enhances FODs efficiently (60x faster than predecessors).

Result: Superior performance in FOD enhancement, enabling robust analysis of clinical data comparable to high-quality research acquisitions.

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net accelerates clinical neuroscience research, improves disease differentiation, and builds trust in deep learning for diffusion MRI enhancement.

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

*Wenbin An,Jiahao Nie,Yaqiang Wu,Feng Tian,Shijian Lu,Qinghua Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys how external tools can enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by improving data quality, task performance, evaluation, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs face challenges like poor data quality, limited task performance, and inadequate evaluation. External tools can address these issues, inspired by human problem-solving.

Method: The paper presents a structured survey on four dimensions of tool-augmented MLLMs: data acquisition, task performance, evaluation, and future directions.

Result: External tools show transformative potential in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering solutions to current limitations.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the promise of tool-augmented MLLMs and provides a forward-looking perspective for future research and applications.

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

### [18] [ORBIT: An Object Property Reasoning Benchmark for Visual Inference Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10956)
*Abhishek Kolari,Mohammadhossein Khojasteh,Yifan Jiang,Floris den Hengst,Filip Ilievski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORBIT, a VQA benchmark for evaluating VLMs' object property reasoning, highlighting their limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks lack representativeness in reasoning and image categories, blending perception and reasoning.

Method: A systematic evaluation framework with diverse images, reasoning levels, and object property dimensions, instantiated into the ORBIT benchmark.

Result: VLMs perform poorly (40% accuracy) in zero-shot settings, struggling with realistic images and complex reasoning.

Conclusion: ORBIT reveals VLMs' limitations and calls for scalable benchmarking and improved reasoning methods.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

*Jiarong Li,Imad Ali Shah,Diarmaid Geever,Fiachra Collins,Enda Ward,Martin Glavin,Edward Jones,Brian Deegan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to improve VRU detection by addressing RGB's visual ambiguity, selecting key spectral bands for better separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome metamerism in RGB imagery, which hinders VRU detection, by leveraging HSI's unique material signatures.

Method: A band selection strategy combining information theory and image quality metrics to identify optimal HSI bands (497 nm, 607 nm, 895 nm).

Result: Selected HSI bands significantly outperform RGB, improving dissimilarity and perceptual separability metrics by up to 1206.83%.

Conclusion: HSI-based method enhances VRU detection, reducing metameric confusion and supporting safer ADAS and AD systems.

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

### [20] [EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963)
*Zixiang Yang,Yue Ma,Yinhan Zhang,Shanhui Mo,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl is a lightweight control adapter for visual generation that reduces redundancy and latency without retraining, using spatio-temporal caching for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need controllable generation (layout, pose, motion, style) without the high latency and redundancy of methods like ControlNet.

Method: EVCtrl employs a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy: spatial profiling partitions the network into global/local zones, and temporal caching skips redundant denoising steps.

Result: Achieves 2.16x and 2.05x speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: EVCtrl efficiently enables precise control in visual generation without retraining, significantly improving speed.

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Rosiana Natalie,Wenqian Xu,Ruei-Che Chang,Rada Mihalcea,Anhong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs simulate low vision perception but struggle without detailed prompts. Combining vision info and example responses improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate VLMs' ability to simulate low vision perception, an underexplored area in accessibility research.

Method: Surveyed 40 low vision participants, created VLM prompts with their data, and measured agreement between VLM and human responses.

Result: VLMs inferred beyond given vision info with minimal prompts (agreement: 0.59). Combining vision info and example responses boosted agreement to 0.70.

Conclusion: Detailed prompts combining vision info and example responses significantly improve VLM simulation accuracy for low vision perception.

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

### [22] [Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011)
*Xuezheng Chen,Zhengbo Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConstructionSite 10k, a dataset of 10,000 annotated construction site images for evaluating and fine-tuning Vision Language Models (VLMs) in safety inspections, addressing the lack of open datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM applications in construction safety inspections rely on small, supervised datasets, limiting their generalization. The lack of open datasets hinders comprehensive evaluation and advancement.

Method: The authors propose ConstructionSite 10k, featuring annotations for image captioning, safety rule violation VQA, and construction element visual grounding. They evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: VLMs show notable generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings but require additional training for real-world construction site applicability.

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k serves as a benchmark for training and evaluating VLMs, advancing construction safety inspection research.

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates multi-modal LLMs for detecting fraudulent documents, finding top models outperform traditional methods but with variability in performance. Task-specific tuning is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document fraud threatens industries needing secure documentation, requiring advanced detection methods.

Method: Benchmarked multi-modal LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) on a standard dataset, analyzing their reasoning and prompt optimization for fraud indicators.

Result: Top LLMs excel in zero-shot generalization, but performance varies; model size doesn't strongly correlate with accuracy.

Conclusion: Multi-modal LLMs show promise for fraud detection, emphasizing the need for task-specific tuning and future research on scalable strategies.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSAMix is a training-free model merging method combining generalist (SAM) and specialist (MedSAM) models for medical image segmentation, improving performance by 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuned models like MedSAM struggle with limited, heterogeneous medical data, hindering generalization across tasks.

Method: Proposes MedSAMix, using zero-order optimization for automatic layer-wise merging and two regimes for domain-specificity and generalizability.

Result: Achieves 6.67% improvement on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations across 25 medical segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MedSAMix effectively balances domain-specific accuracy and generalization, outperforming traditional merging methods.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-ScanQA and TripAlign datasets address limitations in 3D VL learning by enabling multi-view reasoning and richer contextual alignments, with LEGO baseline achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D VL datasets lack multi-view reasoning and contextual alignments, hindering deep 3D scene understanding.

Method: Introduce MV-ScanQA for multi-view QA and TripAlign for 2D-3D-language pre-training; develop LEGO baseline leveraging pre-trained 2D LVLMs.

Result: LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign achieves SOTA on MV-ScanQA and existing 3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA and TripAlign advance 3D VL learning, with LEGO demonstrating effective multi-view reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses AI to analyze 3D clinical imaging for detailed body composition, identifying shared abdominal signatures linked to type 2 diabetes across weight classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover detailed body composition phenotypes of type 2 diabetes, as BMI alone is insufficient to explain disease presence in lean adults or absence in obese individuals.

Method: Applied a design to clinical CT scans (n=1,728), segmenting and classifying type 2 diabetes via random forest, analyzing feature contributions with SHAP, and clustering decision patterns.

Result: Random forests achieved AUCs of 0.72-0.74, revealing shared diabetes signatures like fatty skeletal muscle, older age, and fat distribution patterns.

Conclusion: Abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes are consistent across weight classes, suggesting BMI-independent risk factors.

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierOctFusion, a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model, improves 3D content generation by leveraging hierarchical feature interaction and part-level conditioning, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing octree-based diffusion models overlook semantic part hierarchies and face computational inefficiency in holistic high-resolution modeling, limiting generalization and practicality.

Method: HierOctFusion introduces a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model with cross-attention conditioning for hierarchical feature interaction and part-level information injection. A 3D dataset with part annotations is also constructed for training.

Result: HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and efficiency compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses limitations in 3D content generation by integrating part hierarchies and hierarchical feature interaction, demonstrating improved performance.

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

TL;DR: Proposes a residual-based bidirectional diffusion model (RBDM) for translating between hazy and haze-free images, achieving efficient and high-quality results with minimal steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep dehazing methods lack bidirectional translation capability between hazy and haze-free images.

Method: Uses dual Markov chains for residual shifting, perturbing images at timesteps to predict noise, and a unified score function on patches for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with only 15 sampling steps.

Conclusion: RBDM effectively enables bidirectional transitions between hazy and haze-free images efficiently and with high quality.

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

*Bin Ma,Yifei Zhang,Yongjin Xian,Qi Li,Linna Zhou,Gongxun Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MICC, a cross-modal rumor detection method using contrastive learning to analyze text and multi-scale image relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore image content and context-image relationships, losing critical rumor detection information.

Method: Uses an SCLIP encoder for semantic embeddings, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module, and a scale-aware fusion network to integrate text and image features.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MICC is effective and practical for rumor detection by leveraging multi-scale image-text correlations.

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating coherent, pedagogically sound illustrations for STEM education that align with Bloom's taxonomy and Cognitive Load Theory.

Method: Uses layout-conditioned generation, contrastive visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation to produce structured visual sequences.

Result: Generates coherent visual sequences supporting mid-to-high-level reasoning and reduces extraneous cognitive load.

Conclusion: LEARN pioneers a unified approach for generative AI in education, with potential for integration into multimodal systems and knowledge graphs.

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released
to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

*Bing Liu,Le Wang,Mingming Liu,Hao Liu,Rui Yao,Yong Zhou,Peng Liu,Tongqiang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EM-B3DM, a semi-supervised image dehazing method using Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dehazing methods struggle with real-world haze, especially thick haze, due to lack of paired data and robust priors.

Method: Uses a two-stage learning scheme: EM algorithm to decouple distributions, modeled with Brownian Bridge diffusion, followed by leveraging unpaired data. Introduces RDC block for gradient-level detail.

Result: EM-B3DM achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses dehazing challenges without costly paired data collection, enhancing performance with innovative modeling and detail capture.

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Jianhong Han,Yupei Wang,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VG-DETR is a semi-supervised framework for source-free object detection in remote sensing, using a Vision Foundation Model to improve pseudo-label quality and feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and transmission constraints limit access to source domain data in remote sensing, making source-free object detection (SFOD) necessary. However, SFOD suffers from noisy pseudo-labels in dense, complex scenes.

Method: VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) to guide pseudo-label mining and feature alignment. It uses labeled target data to reduce noise and employs dual-level alignment (instance and image levels) for robust feature representation.

Result: VG-DETR outperforms existing methods in source-free remote sensing detection tasks, demonstrating improved pseudo-label quality and feature robustness.

Conclusion: VG-DETR effectively addresses the challenges of SFOD in remote sensing by leveraging VFM guidance, enhancing both pseudo-label reliability and feature alignment.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

*Baihong Qian,Haotian Fan,Wenjie Liao,Yunqiu Wang,Tao Li,Junhui Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IOVQA is a fine-tuning method for VLMs that improves video quality assessment by using integer labels and a target-mask strategy, achieving high accuracy in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM methods for visual content assessment are imprecise and inefficient, limiting focus on key evaluation indicators.

Method: IOVQA constrains outputs to integers [10,50], converts decimal labels to integers, and uses a target-mask strategy to focus on critical evaluation components.

Result: IOVQA significantly improves accuracy and consistency, ranking 3rd in the VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench Challenge.

Conclusion: Integer-only fine-tuning is effective for optimizing VLMs in quantitative evaluation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

*Ruobing Jiang,Yang Liu,Haobing Liu,Yanwei Yu,Chunyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDOD method improves continuous category discovery by addressing novel class discovery and classification contradictions, reducing error accumulation, and minimizing storage overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CCD methods struggle with balancing novel class discovery and classification, accumulate errors, and require excessive storage for preventing forgetting.

Method: IDOD uses independent diversity enrichment, joint novelty discovery, and orthogonality-based continuous increment to improve performance and reduce storage needs.

Result: IDOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: IDOD effectively addresses CCD challenges with better performance and lower storage requirements.

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatHAdapter improves few-shot classification by aligning visual and textual representations in a hyperbolic space, capturing latent hierarchies for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adapters fail to model one-to-many associations between categories and images and struggle with unknown categories.

Method: LatHAdapter uses learnable attribute prompts and hyperbolic space projection with hierarchical regularization to align categories, attributes, and images.

Result: LatHAdapter outperforms other methods on four few-shot tasks, especially for known and unknown classes.

Conclusion: LatHAdapter effectively models latent hierarchies, enhancing few-shot classification performance.

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVT introduces a Gaussian Video Transformer for versatile video tokenization, improving spatial and temporal adaptability with 2D Gaussian Splatting and partitioning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video tokenization methods lack versatility, over-encode low-information regions, and struggle with temporal redundancy.

Method: GVT uses 2D Gaussian Splatting (STGE) for spatial adaptability and Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) for temporal versatility.

Result: GVT achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction, outperforms MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and matches compression benchmarks.

Conclusion: GVT offers a flexible and efficient solution for video tokenization, excelling in reconstruction, recognition, and compression tasks.

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Motivation: Existing monocular 3D detectors struggle with unseen camera heights, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: Proposes CHARM3R, which averages regressed and ground-based depth estimates to mitigate depth errors caused by camera height variations.

Result: CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by over 45% and achieves SoTA on the CARLA dataset.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the understudied problem of camera height variations in monocular 3D detection, offering a practical solution with CHARM3R.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Motivation: There is a lack of dialogue-video datasets for real-world task assistance, despite the need for expert knowledge in complex tasks.

Method: The approach automatically converts single-person instructional videos into two-person dialogues, aligning them with fine-grained steps and video clips.

Result: The HowToDIV dataset contains 507 conversations, 6,636 QA pairs, and 24 hours of video clips across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset and baseline performance using Gemma-3 provide a foundation for future research on procedural-task assistance dialogues.

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car
maintenance require expert knowledge, especially when tasks are complex and
multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of
dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person
instructional videos into task-guidance two-person dialogues, aligned with fine
grained steps and video-clips. Our fully automatic approach, powered by large
language models, offers an efficient alternative to the substantial cost and
effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable
device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset
through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

TL;DR: UAV-VL-R1 is a lightweight vision-language model designed for aerial imagery, using hybrid training (SFT and RL) and GRPO for structured reasoning. It outperforms larger models and supports real-time UAV deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs struggle with UAV imagery due to high resolution, complex semantics, and real-time constraints, limiting their use in aerial tasks.

Method: Proposes UAV-VL-R1, trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) with GRPO for rule-guided rewards and policy alignment. Introduces HRVQA-VL dataset for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct and outperforms its 72B variant. Requires only 3.9GB (FP16) or 2.5GB (INT8) memory.

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1 addresses aerial reasoning challenges, offering superior performance, efficiency, and real-time applicability for UAV platforms.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

*Zhangjian Ji,Wenjin Zhang,Shaotong Qiao,Kai Feng,Yuhua Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage knowledge distillation framework improves lightweight human pose estimation by leveraging structural and contextual joint information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods are computationally heavy; knowledge distillation can transfer accuracy to lightweight models but lacks joint context exploration.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine two-stage distillation: first-stage uses joint structure loss, second-stage refines with an Image-Guided Progressive GCN.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, with notable gains on complex CrowdPose.

Conclusion: The framework effectively transfers pose knowledge, enhancing accuracy and robustness in lightweight models.

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

*Jialin Li,Shuqi Wu,Ning Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework is proposed to address challenges in pedestrian ReID under uncertain or missing input modalities, achieving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ReID struggles with uncertain or missing modalities (e.g., RGB, infrared), and large pre-trained models are impractical for resource-constrained environments like autonomous driving.

Method: UMM integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation, and cross-modal cue interactive learner, leveraging CLIP's alignment for efficient fusion.

Result: UMM demonstrates robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency in uncertain modality conditions.

Conclusion: UMM provides a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian ReID in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

TL;DR: DeCLIP enhances CLIP for dense perception by decoupling self-attention into content and context features, improving local discriminability and spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CLIP in dense perception tasks due to poor local feature representation and spatial inconsistency.

Method: Proposes DeCLIP, decoupling self-attention into content and context features, enhanced by semantic correlations from VFMs and object integrity cues from diffusion models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks like 2D detection, segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, and more.

Conclusion: DeCLIP provides a robust solution for open-vocabulary dense perception, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

TL;DR: The study investigates gender-linked associations in vision-language models (VLM) by analyzing embeddings of face images and occupational/activity phrases, revealing subtle biases not captured by standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and quantify social stereotypes encoded in VLMs, particularly gender-linked associations, which standard accuracy metrics fail to detect.

Method: Used a dataset of 220 face images (split by perceived gender) and 150 statements across six labor categories. Computed embeddings and association scores via cosine similarity, with bootstrap confidence intervals and a label-swap null model for validation.

Result: Produced a detailed map of gender associations in VLMs, showing biases in occupational and activity-related embeddings, with quantified uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for evaluating gender bias in VLMs, highlighting the need to address subtle stereotypes in model alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

*Pei He,Lingling Li,Licheng Jiao,Ronghua Shang,Fang Liu,Shuang Wang,Xu Liu,Wenping Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for domain generalization in 3D segmentation using category-level geometry learning to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of domain shift in 3D segmentation by focusing on category-level geometric features rather than global patterns.

Method: Proposes Category-level Geometry Embedding (CGE) for fine-grained geometric properties and Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) for aligning embeddings.

Result: Achieves competitive segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves generalization by leveraging domain-invariant geometric features.

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMTFR, a framework for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), combining a Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement to improve performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods often require extra training or complex prompt designs, and CoT techniques are underutilized in supervised CIR.

Method: Proposes PMTFR with Pyramid Patcher for multi-granular visual understanding and injects CoT-derived representations into LVLMs for refinement.

Result: PMTFR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses CIR challenges without additional training, offering a simple yet powerful solution.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

TL;DR: SAEs are evaluated for vision models, showing they improve interpretability, generalization, and steerability across tasks like OOD detection, semantic steering, and multi-modal representation discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs are widely used in language models but understudied in vision. This work aims to evaluate their potential in visual tasks.

Method: Extensive evaluation of SAEs on vision models (embedding, multi-modal LLMs, diffusion models) for tasks like OOD detection, semantic steering, and attribute discovery.

Result: SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve OOD generalization, enable controllable generation, and reveal shared multi-modal representations.

Conclusion: SAEs show strong potential for enhancing interpretability, generalization, and steerability in vision models, laying a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

TL;DR: A unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction integrates scale-aware depth prediction and temporal refinement to address challenges like depth ambiguity and tissue deformation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by improving endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction despite challenges like depth ambiguity and tissue deformation.

Method: Combines MAPIS-Depth for pseudo-metric depth estimation, RAFT for pixel correspondences, LPIPS for perceptual refinement, and WEMA-RTDL for accurate registration, followed by volumetric fusion for 3D mesh extraction.

Result: Demonstrates robustness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods on HEVD and SCARED datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in monocular endoscopic reconstruction, offering improved accuracy and spatial awareness for surgical navigation.

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TimeMachine is a diffusion-based framework for fine-grained facial age editing while preserving identity, using high-precision age injection and an Age Classifier Guidance module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving fine-grained age editing without altering personal identity is challenging in facial image editing.

Method: Proposes TimeMachine with multi-cross attention for age-identity disentanglement and an Age Classifier Guidance module for latent space age prediction.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing with identity preservation, validated on the HFFA dataset.

Conclusion: TimeMachine effectively addresses the challenge of precise age editing while maintaining identity consistency.

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

TL;DR: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) outperforms RGB for pedestrian segmentation, with CSNR-JMIM band selection showing the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety challenges in pedestrian segmentation due to metamerism in RGB imaging by exploring HSI.

Method: Compared RGB with two HSI dimensionality-reduction methods (PCA and CSNR-JMIM) using three segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer).

Result: CSNR-JMIM improved pedestrian segmentation by 1.44% IoU and 2.18% F1-score, with similar gains for riders.

Conclusion: Optimal HSI band selection enhances segmentation, proving valuable for automotive safety.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm (DRNet) for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR), filtering irrelevant clips before retrieval to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VMR methods encode all video clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and optimization.

Method: Introduces DRNet with Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF) modules to filter noise and align purified video representations with text.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Charades-STA and QVHighlights datasets.

Conclusion: The denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and enhances existing VMR models.

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP lack logical understanding, limiting their reliability. LogicBench and LogicCLIP aim to address this gap.

Method: LogicBench evaluates VLMs on 50,000+ vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories. LogicCLIP enhances logical sensitivity via logic-aware data generation and contrastive learning.

Result: VLMs lag 40+ accuracy points behind humans in logical tasks. LogicCLIP outperforms baselines and maintains general alignment.

Conclusion: LogicBench and LogicCLIP advance VLM logical capabilities while preserving general performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle in crowded scenes or with inaccurate detections due to overlooking geometric relationships between objects. Geometry-aware methods can suffer from irrelevant object interference.

Method: DSC-Track uses a spatiotemporal encoder with Point Pair Features (PPF) and a cue-consistency transformer module to align features between tracks and detections. A dynamic update mechanism preserves key information.

Result: Achieves 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on nuScenes validation and test sets, respectively, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DSC-Track effectively leverages spatial cues and cue-consistency for robust 3D multi-object tracking, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoOp, a noise optimization method for Diffusion Classifiers (DC) to address noise instability, improving classification speed and performance by learning dataset-specific and image-specific noises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Diffusion Classifiers (DCs) suffer from noise instability, requiring hundreds of noise samples for stable performance, which slows down classification. The paper aims to identify and optimize 'good noises' to mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes NoOp, which optimizes dataset-specific noise for frequency matching and trains a Meta-Network for spatial matching to generate image-specific noise offsets.

Result: Extensive experiments show NoOp effectively improves the stability and speed of DCs.

Conclusion: NoOp successfully addresses noise instability in DCs by optimizing noise, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Motivation: To measure, explain, and reduce bias in face recognition systems by precisely controlling demographic and environmental factors.

Method: Unifies StyleGAN3 for identity-preserving generation with diffusion models for fine-grained attribute control (pose, illumination, expression). Generates 10,000 demographically balanced faces for bias analysis.

Result: AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%. Illumination accounts for 42% of residual bias. Strong synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85).

Conclusion: GANDiff FR provides a reproducible, regulation-aligned standard for fairness auditing, with scalable bias evaluation tools released.

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

*Mingxiao Ma,Shunyao Zhu,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based incremental object detection, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based incremental object detection (IOD) degrades performance on old categories. Current methods using Hungarian Matching for knowledge distillation (KD) are ineffective.

Method: Proposes IAQD, which aligns queries by index instead of Hungarian Matching and focuses on critical queries for old categories.

Result: IAQD achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively preserving knowledge of old categories while learning new ones.

Conclusion: IAQD is a superior approach for transformer-based IOD, addressing the limitations of Hungarian Matching and improving model stability.

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

*Yuanlin Liu,Zhihan Zhou,Mingqiang Wei,Youyi Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes active labeling to reduce human cost in training datasets for cervical cell classification by leveraging classifier uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive human effort for representative training datasets in cervical cell classification.

Method: Uses active labeling to select beneficial unlabeled images based on classifier uncertainty, reducing human cost.

Result: The method enhances dataset representativeness and navigates human cost effectively.

Conclusion: Active labeling enables data-efficient cervical cell classification with reduced human effort.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

*Katarzyna Filus,Jorge M. Cruz-Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantics-guided framework for selecting adversarial target labels in vision models, leveraging cross-modal knowledge from pretrained language and vision-language models. It outperforms traditional methods like WordNet, especially for distant class relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack strategies lack interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility due to reliance on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes using pretrained models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, CLIP) as similarity sources to select semantically related labels for adversarial attacks. Evaluates best- and worst-case scenarios on three vision models and five attack methods.

Result: Pretrained models consistently provide practical adversarial targets, surpassing static databases like WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. Static testing of target labels offers preliminary effectiveness assessment.

Conclusion: Pretrained models are suitable for creating interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOID-R1 is a novel HOI detection framework combining CoT-guided SFT and GRPO in RL, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks and open-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI detection methods rely heavily on large language models for textual prompts, lacking 3D spatial understanding. HOID-R1 addresses this gap.

Method: Integrates CoT-guided SFT for reasoning and GRPO for multi-reward policy optimization, with an MLLM-as-a-judge mechanism to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI benchmarks and excels in open-world generalization.

Conclusion: HOID-R1 effectively combines reasoning and RL, improving HOI detection and generalization.

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

*Zhenyi Zhao,Muthu Rama Krishnan Mookiah,Emanuele Trucco*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RETFound, a foundation model for retinal images, is adapted for optic disc segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore RETFound's potential beyond disease diagnosis by applying it to optic disc segmentation, a key task in retinal image analysis.

Method: Adapt RETFound for optic disc segmentation by training a head with few task-specific examples and evaluating on multiple datasets.

Result: Achieves ~96% Dice score across datasets, excelling in internal verification, domain generalization, and adaptation.

Conclusion: RETFound proves effective for segmentation, challenging the need for task-specific architectures, with code to be shared.

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

### [62] [Does the Skeleton-Recall Loss Really Work?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11374)
*Devansh Arora,Nitin Kumar,Sukrit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critically evaluates the Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) for tubular structure segmentation, finding it underperforms traditional baselines despite claims of state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of topology-based loss functions like SRL in image segmentation, particularly for thin tubular structures, and provide theoretical and empirical insights.

Method: Theoretical analysis of SRL gradients and empirical comparison on tubular datasets, including those from the original SRL work and additional ones.

Result: SRL-based models did not outperform traditional baseline models, contradicting earlier claims.

Conclusion: Topology-based loss functions like SRL have limitations, highlighting the need for further research to improve segmentation of complex tubular structures.

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

*Durgesh Mishra,Rishabh Uikey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified knowledge distillation framework for face recognition models combines instance-level and relational distillation to improve performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods fail to capture fine-grained details and relational structures, limiting performance in face recognition for edge devices.

Method: Proposes two novel loss functions: Instance-Level Embedding Distillation (dynamic hard mining) and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation (memory bank mechanism).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets; student models can surpass teacher accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively aligns instance-level features and preserves relational structures, enhancing distillation for face recognition.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

TL;DR: G-CUT3R enhances 3D scene reconstruction by integrating prior data like depth or camera info, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward methods rely only on images, missing out on commonly available auxiliary data.

Method: Lightweight modification of CUT3R with dedicated encoders for each modality, fused via zero convolution.

Result: Significant performance improvements in 3D reconstruction and multi-view tasks.

Conclusion: G-CUT3R effectively utilizes priors while remaining flexible with input modalities.

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

### [65] [RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11409)
*Zhiming Liu,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMFAT is a lightweight recurrent framework for efficient video restoration under atmospheric turbulence, reducing computational cost while improving clarity and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric turbulence degrades video quality, and existing methods are computationally expensive, limiting real-time use.

Method: RMFAT uses a recurrent framework with multi-scale feature encoding/decoding and temporal warping, requiring only two frames per restoration.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in clarity (9% SSIM improvement) and speed (4x faster runtime).

Conclusion: RMFAT is efficient and effective for real-time atmospheric turbulence mitigation.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

TL;DR: SelfAdapt is a label-free method for adapting pre-trained cell segmentation models, improving performance on diverse datasets without requiring annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist models like Cellpose degrade in performance on domains differing from their training data, and supervised fine-tuning requires scarce annotated data.

Method: SelfAdapt uses student-teacher augmentation consistency training with L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria.

Result: Achieves up to 29.64% relative improvement in AP0.5 over baseline Cellpose on LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, even enhancing supervised fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: SelfAdapt is an effective, unsupervised adaptation tool for cell segmentation, released as an extension of Cellpose.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly
available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

*Florian Bayer,Maximilian Russo,Christian Rathgeb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores reducing multi-biometric template sizes using dimensionality reduction and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to improve efficiency without compromising accuracy or security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric recognition's widespread use raises privacy and security concerns, especially with the computational challenges of Homomorphic Encryption. Multi-modal fusion can enhance security, but efficient encrypted processing is needed.

Method: The study uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for feature extraction from face, fingerprint, and iris modalities. It evaluates dimensionality reduction of feature vectors to reduce HE workload while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Fusing feature vectors from multiple modalities reduces template size by 67% without loss in Equal Error Rate (EER), matching or surpassing single-biometric recognition performance.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction and multi-modal fusion enable efficient encrypted biometric processing, maintaining security and accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

TL;DR: ImagiDrive integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) for autonomous driving, combining behavioral prediction with realistic scene generation to improve planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving needs contextual comprehension and predictive reasoning. VLMs and DWMs address different aspects but integrating them is understudied.

Method: ImagiDrive combines a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer, using an iterative loop for planning and refinement, with efficiency mechanisms.

Result: Extensive testing on nuScenes and NAVSIM shows ImagiDrive outperforms previous methods in robustness and performance.

Conclusion: ImagiDrive successfully integrates VLMs and DWMs, enhancing autonomous driving planning with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and measure unintended semantic traces left after object removal in 3D reconstructions, critical for privacy and editable scenes.

Method: Introduces Remove360 dataset and framework to evaluate semantic residuals in diverse indoor/outdoor scenes, assessing downstream model inference.

Result: Current methods preserve semantic information despite visual geometry removal, revealing limitations in real-world complexity handling.

Conclusion: Robust solutions are needed for effective object removal in complex scenes, as current techniques fall short.

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

TL;DR: MM-R1 is a framework using X-CoT reasoning and GRPO to enable unified MLLMs for zero-shot personalized image generation without subject-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning MLLMs with personalized image generation is challenging due to data-intensive fine-tuning for new subjects, limiting scalability.

Method: MM-R1 integrates X-CoT reasoning for visual grounding and generation, enhanced by GRPO for alignment.

Result: MM-R1 achieves high subject fidelity and text alignment in zero-shot personalized image generation.

Conclusion: MM-R1 successfully unlocks MLLMs' potential for scalable, zero-shot personalized image generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-based deep learning approach for indoor navigation, avoiding GPS reliance, special sensors, or markers. It uses a novel graph-based method, explainable data augmentation, and curriculum learning, and includes a new dataset and an Android app.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor navigation is challenging due to poor GPS access and complex existing solutions. The goal is to create an efficient, real-time, and easily deployable method using only visual input.

Method: A deep learning approach based on visual input, using a graph-based path generation method, explainable data augmentation, and curriculum learning. The method avoids special sensors or markers.

Result: A novel large-scale dataset from a shopping mall with annotated frames for direction prediction. An Android app was also developed for practical use.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-only method is efficient, deployable, and avoids dependencies on external sensors or infrastructure, with plans to release data, code, and an app publicly.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Motivation: Address challenges in YOLO-based methods for abnormal human behavior detection, such as small objects, task conflicts, and multi-scale fusion.

Method: Introduces Coordinate Attention Module, Task-Aware Attention Module, and Strengthen Neck Network, optimizes Anchor Box sizes with K-means, and uses DIoU-Loss.

Conclusion: TACR-YOLO advances abnormal behavior detection in special scenarios, providing new insights.

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews 51 visual datasets in construction (2005-2024), categorizing them by data fundamentals, modalities, annotations, and applications. It introduces OpenConstruction, an open-source catalog, and highlights gaps and future directions for FAIR-compliant data infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic review and categorization of visual datasets in construction, which limits AI/ML applications.

Method: Extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms, categorizing datasets using a structured schema.

Result: 51 datasets were cataloged, revealing gaps in representativeness and annotation quality. OpenConstruction was created to support data-driven development.

Conclusion: The study provides a roadmap for FAIR-compliant data infrastructure to advance data-centric solutions in construction.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

*Xiaoxue Wu,Bingjie Gao,Yu Qiao,Yaohui Wang,Xinyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineTrans is a framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic transitions, leveraging a new dataset and attention-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video synthesis struggles with multi-shot generation, limiting videos to single-shot sequences.

Method: Introduces CineTrans, a framework using a dataset (Cine250K) and mask-based control for transitions.

Result: Produces stable, cinematic multi-shot videos, outperforming baselines in evaluations.

Conclusion: CineTrans advances multi-shot video generation with effective transitions and high-quality results.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify energy conservation in buildings while preserving cultural heritage, avoiding costly traditional methods.

Method: Used GPT to detect cultural heritage values in facade images, combined with register data, to train machine learning models for building classification.

Result: Achieved macro F1-scores of 0.71 (combined data) and 0.60 (GPT-only data) against expert inventories.

Conclusion: The method enhances databases for energy efficiency measures, balancing heritage preservation in large-scale refurbishments.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional
inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect
various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

*Bozhou Zhang,Jingyu Li,Nan Song,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeteranAD integrates perception into planning for end-to-end autonomous driving, using multi-mode trajectories for targeted perception and autoregressive prediction to enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve planning performance by integrating perception dynamically into the planning process, guided by evolving objectives.

Method: Introduces VeteranAD, a framework coupling perception and planning with multi-mode anchored trajectories and autoregressive prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets.

Conclusion: VeteranAD's design effectively enhances planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving, yielding more accurate and reliable behavior.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HGFE, a graph-based framework integrated into CNNs to enhance structural awareness and feature representation by modeling local and global relationships, validated across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs' reliance on grid structures limits their ability to model complex topological and non-local semantic relationships in images.

Method: HGFE introduces hierarchical graph structures (intra-window and inter-window) and an adaptive frequency modulation module to balance signal propagation.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100, PASCAL VOC, VisDrone, CrackSeg, and CarParts show improved structural representation and recognition performance.

Conclusion: HGFE is a lightweight, trainable solution that enhances CNNs by integrating graph-based reasoning, validated across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Motivation: Historical handwritten text recognition is challenging due to scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and diverse handwriting styles, limiting digitization efforts.

Method: The study uses TrOCR, introduces four novel data augmentation techniques for historical handwriting, and evaluates ensemble learning approaches.

Result: The best single-model augmentation achieves a CER of 1.86, and a top-5 voting ensemble reduces CER to 1.60, marking a 50% improvement over previous results.

Conclusion: Domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies significantly enhance HTR performance for historical manuscripts.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

*Eyad Alshami,Shashank Agnihotri,Bernt Schiele,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIM is a self-supervised method that enhances DNNs' use of genuine features over spurious ones, improving interpretability and accuracy without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs often rely on spurious features; AIM aims to prioritize genuine features for better interpretability and generalization.

Method: AIM uses multi-stage features to guide self-supervised, sample-specific masking, training interpretable models.

Result: AIM improves interpretability (EPG score) and accuracy across diverse datasets like ImageNet100 and CUB-200.

Conclusion: AIM effectively promotes genuine feature use, enhancing generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

TL;DR: A multi-task concrete crack detection model, YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, is proposed to improve efficiency and accuracy in infrastructure inspection, outperforming baseline methods with 91.3% precision and 86.4% mAP@50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid aging of transportation infrastructure in the Yangtze River Delta requires efficient crack detection, as manual methods and existing deep learning models are inadequate for small-target cracks in complex backgrounds.

Method: The model integrates a three-stage optimization: dynamic KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) for feature enhancement, a triple attention mechanism (TA) for better channel-spatial interaction, and an FP-IoU loss function for adaptive bounding box regression.

Result: The model achieves 91.3% precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50, with robustness confirmed under data scarcity and noise.

Conclusion: The research provides an efficient computer vision solution for automated infrastructure inspection, demonstrating practical engineering value.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

*Shilei Wang,Gong Cheng,Pujian Lai,Dong Gao,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MST introduces lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) and cross-state interaction (CSI) to improve feature representation in efficient trackers, achieving better accuracy and robustness with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient trackers often sacrifice feature representation for speed, limiting accuracy. MST aims to enhance feature representation without significant computational cost.

Method: MST uses multi-state generation (MSG) to create multiple state features, refines them with SSE, and aggregates them via CSI. The design includes lightweight HSA-SSD modules for efficiency.

Result: MST outperforms prior efficient trackers, improving tracking accuracy (e.g., 4.5% AO score boost on GOT-10K) with low computational overhead (0.1 GFLOPs, 0.66M parameters).

Conclusion: MST successfully balances efficiency and feature representation, offering superior tracking performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Motivation: Efficient and high-accuracy medical image classification is challenging in resource-limited settings, necessitating optimized methods.

Method: The method improves ConvNeXt-Tiny with dual global pooling, a lightweight SEVector attention module, and Feature Smoothing Loss to enhance feature extraction and classification.

Result: Achieves 89.10% accuracy on CPU-only conditions with stable convergence, demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a feasible and efficient solution for medical image classification in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

TL;DR: Veason-R1 is a specialized LVLM for video reasoning segmentation (VRS) that uses structured reasoning and GRPO with CoT initialization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VRS methods lack interpretability and spatiotemporal reasoning, limiting performance. Veason-R1 aims to address these gaps.

Method: Veason-R1 employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization for structured reasoning, enhancing spatial and temporal alignment.

Result: Veason-R1 outperforms prior methods, e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS, with improved robustness (+8.8 R).

Conclusion: Veason-R1 advances VRS by integrating structured reasoning and GRPO, achieving superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

TL;DR: AAG is a training-free anomaly generation framework using Stable Diffusion to create realistic anomalies in specific image regions while preserving other areas, enhancing downstream AD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity in industrial anomaly detection by improving anomaly generation fidelity without extra training data.

Method: Uses Stable Diffusion with Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) and Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) to guide anomaly generation via text prompts and masks.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, improving anomaly inspection tasks.

Conclusion: AAG offers a practical solution for realistic anomaly generation, benefiting industrial AD applications.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Motivation: To resolve unresolved issues in sports analytics like data unavailability, ineffective trajectory frameworks, and supervision label requirements.

Method: TrajSV includes data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet), optimized with triple contrastive loss.

Result: Achieves 70% better sports video retrieval, state-of-the-art in 9/17 action categories, and 20% better video captioning.

Conclusion: TrajSV effectively addresses sports analytics challenges and outperforms baselines in multiple applications.

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores temporal understanding in VideoLMs, finding that positional encodings (PEs) are less critical than assumed, while frame sequence reversal significantly impacts performance. It identifies an emergent temporal reasoning mechanism and proposes efficiency strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal understanding in VideoLMs remains a challenge, with prior work focusing on PEs. The study aims to uncover how temporal information is actually integrated.

Method: Analyzes the role of PEs and frame sequence in temporal understanding, identifies an emergent causal information pathway, and proposes staged cross-modal attention and temporal exit mechanisms.

Result: Removing/modifying PEs has minimal impact, while reversing frames causes a performance drop. The proposed strategies improve efficiency and are validated on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temporal reasoning in VideoLMs emerges from inter-visual token interactions, not PEs. The findings and proposed strategies offer insights for future model improvements.

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

*Durga Joshi,Chandi Witharana,Robert Fahey,Thomas Worthley,Zhe Zhu,Diego Cerrai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost, reproducible framework using dashcam video for real-time structural assessment and geolocation of roadside objects, combining monocular depth estimation, error correction, and GPS-based triangulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cost-effective, scalable solution for real-time monitoring of roadside vegetation and infrastructure, addressing limitations of conventional methods like LiDAR.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline with monocular depth estimation, depth error correction via gradient-boosted regression, and GPS-based triangulation for geolocation and height estimation.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31) in depth correction, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m and height MAE of 2.09 m (trees) and 0.88 m (poles).

Conclusion: The framework offers a fast, real-time, and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods, valuable for utility companies and urban planners.

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

### [90] [CoreEditor: Consistent 3D Editing via Correspondence-constrained Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11603)
*Zhe Zhu,Honghua Chen,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoreEditor introduces a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism for consistent text-to-3D editing, outperforming prior methods with sharper details and better cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven 3D editing methods often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details.

Method: CoreEditor uses a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism and incorporates semantic similarity during denoising for robust multi-view editing. It also includes a selective editing pipeline for user flexibility.

Result: CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: CoreEditor advances text-to-3D editing by ensuring cross-view consistency and offering user control, setting a new benchmark for quality.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

### [91] [Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11616)
*Oscar Mañas,Pierluca D'Oro,Koustuv Sinha,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal,Aishwarya Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reward-guided decoding method for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve visual grounding, offering dynamic control over precision, recall, and computational trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt MLLMs for diverse user needs by enhancing their visual grounding capabilities through controlled decoding.

Method: Develops two reward models for object precision and recall, guiding the MLLM's decoding process dynamically.

Result: The method outperforms existing hallucination mitigation techniques and provides significant controllability over MLLM inference.

Conclusion: Reward-guided decoding enables flexible and improved adaptation of MLLMs for visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

### [92] [LoRAtorio: An intrinsic approach to LoRA Skill Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11624)
*Niki Foteinopoulou,Ignas Budvytis,Stephan Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRAtorio is a train-free framework for composing multiple LoRA adapters in text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging intrinsic model behavior and spatial-aware weighting for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with composing multiple LoRA adapters in open-ended settings, where the required skills are unknown in advance.

Method: LoRAtorio divides latent space into patches, computes cosine similarity between predicted noise and base model noise, and uses a spatially-aware weight matrix for weighted aggregation. It also modifies classifier-free guidance to address domain drift.

Result: Achieves up to 1.3% improvement in ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V evaluations, generalizing well across models.

Conclusion: LoRAtorio offers a robust solution for multi-LoRA composition, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

*Qiang Li,Shansong Wang,Mingzhe Hu,Mojtaba Safari,Zachary Eidex,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 outperforms GPT-4o in mammogram VQA tasks but lags behind human experts and specialized models. It shows promise but needs domain adaptation for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential of GPT-5 and GPT-4o in mammogram VQA for breast cancer screening tasks.

Method: Systematic evaluation on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification.

Result: GPT-5 performed best among GPT variants but had lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%) compared to humans. Scores varied by dataset and task.

Conclusion: GPT-5 shows promise for mammography VQA but requires domain-specific optimization for clinical use. Performance improvements from GPT-4o to GPT-5 indicate potential for LLMs in this field.

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thyme introduces a novel paradigm for MLLMs to autonomously generate and execute image processing and computational operations via code, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source models lack the rich feature set of proprietary models for image manipulation and reasoning. Thyme aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Thyme uses a two-stage training strategy: SFT on 500K samples for code generation, followed by RL with GRPO-ATS for refined decision-making.

Result: Thyme achieves significant performance gains on 20 benchmarks, especially in high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Thyme successfully enhances MLLMs' capabilities by combining image manipulation with logical reasoning through autonomous code execution.

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.
