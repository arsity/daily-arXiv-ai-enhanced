Existing methods predominantly rely on a\npixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a\n3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several\ninherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent\non the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and\nintroduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions\nor low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new\nmulti-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with\nvoxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D\nvoxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature\nmatching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables\nadaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding\nmore faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and\nenhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks\nincluding RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent\nGaussian reconstructions.
