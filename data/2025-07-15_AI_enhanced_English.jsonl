However,\ntheir effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and\nactive scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent\nperceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action\ndynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such\nas GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment\ninteractions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and\nlong-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset\nof over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic\nenvironments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.\nThe tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,\nobject manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a\nmulti-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level\ninstructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express\nthe agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to\nevaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key\ndimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage\nGoal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below\n20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current\nlimitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of\nEmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning\nfollowed by reinforcement learning.
