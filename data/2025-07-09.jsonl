However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the\ninconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to\neffectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To\nfurther address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning\ncomplementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as\nauxiliary modalities.

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of\nvarious HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,\nrepresentation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep\nlearning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets\nusing different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to\nanalyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,\nlimitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep\nlearning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical\nmodels demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets.

To address this cold start problem, we\ndesign a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss\ncomputation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby\npromoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when\ntrained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding\nannotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared\nto GRPO, leading to 5.4\\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and\n5.2\\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.\nNotably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses\nOpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench.

However, when involving generating\nmulti-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely\nentirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated\nobjects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,\nresulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited\nhelp to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose\na prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image\naugmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion\nstrategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge\ninto the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation\nbetween the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a\nreward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss\nfor model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead\nof pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the\ngenerated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the\ngenerated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and\nshowcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization\ncapabilities.

On well-structured domains such as\nvector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential\ngeometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with\nstrong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a\ncarefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most\npractitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing\nlayers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this\ngap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general\nsimilarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized\ninto diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from\nLaplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural\nbehavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing\nand processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or\nmixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate\nheat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,\nwith applications to shape analysis and matching."}

To address these\nchallenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages\nopen-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a\nsynthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired\nconcept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but\nrepresent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to\ncreate CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced\ncaptions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling\nfiner cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.\nExperiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms\nthe base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained\nconcept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original\ngeneralization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and\nVLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions."}

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.
