### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QME, a learnable score-fusion framework for whole-body biometric recognition, addressing limitations of traditional methods by using quality-guided fusion and novel loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional whole-body recognition methods overlook score distribution variations and struggle with performance improvement due to fixed fusion strategies.

Method: Proposes QME, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework with a pseudo-quality loss for quality estimation and a score triplet loss for metric improvement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, outperforming baseline methods in multimodal and multi-model scenarios.

Conclusion: QME effectively addresses challenges like model misalignment and data quality variability, enhancing whole-body biometric recognition performance.

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores motion transferability in action recognition models, revealing performance drops in novel contexts and biases in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if action recognition models can generalize high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions.

Method: Introduces a motion transferability framework with three datasets (Syn-TA, Kinetics400-TA, Something-Something-v2-TA) and evaluates 13 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Models struggle with fine-grained unknown actions; Syn-TA is as challenging as real-world datasets; larger models improve transferability for spatial cues but struggle with temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for motion transferability, highlighting challenges and potential improvements like disentangling coarse and fine motions.

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taih√∫ Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monado SLAM dataset to address gaps in existing VIO/SLAM systems for head-mounted sensors, focusing on challenging real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIO/SLAM systems struggle with head-mounted use cases like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, and adverse conditions, which are poorly represented in current datasets.

Method: The authors present the Monado SLAM dataset, a collection of real sequences from multiple VR headsets, to better capture these challenges.

Result: The dataset is released under a CC BY 4.0 license to foster research and development in VIO/SLAM.

Conclusion: The Monado SLAM dataset aims to improve VIO/SLAM systems by addressing overlooked real-world challenges in head-mounted tracking.

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a CNN model for gender classification using the periocular region, achieving high accuracy (99% and 96%) on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is vital in security and other fields, but accuracy is affected by cosmetics and disguise. The study focuses on the periocular region for reliable classification.

Method: A sophisticated CNN model is developed, tested on CVBL and (Female and Male) datasets, and compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The model achieved 99% accuracy on CVBL and 96% on (Female and Male) datasets with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: The model is effective for gender classification, showing promise for practical use in security and surveillance.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) is a new metric for evaluating generative video models, focusing on internal world consistency through four sub-components. It combines these via a learned formula to align with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation metrics often overlook temporal and physical coherence, focusing instead on visual fidelity or prompt alignment. WCS addresses this gap by emphasizing world consistency.

Method: WCS integrates four submetrics (object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, flicker penalty) computed using open-source tools. A learned weighted formula combines them, trained on human preference data.

Result: WCS is validated using benchmarks like VBench-2.0 and compared against metrics like FVD and CLIPScore, showing alignment with human evaluations.

Conclusion: WCS provides a comprehensive, interpretable framework for assessing video generation models on world coherence, filling gaps left by prior metrics.

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer improves Active Geo-localization (AGL) by using curiosity-driven exploration instead of distance-based rewards, enhancing robustness and generalization in unfamiliar settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGL methods struggle with unreliable exploration in challenging or unseen scenarios due to distance-based rewards.

Method: Proposes GeoExplorer, an AGL agent using curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards for goal-agnostic, diverse exploration.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks, showing effectiveness in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

Conclusion: GeoExplorer's curiosity-driven approach enhances AGL robustness and generalization, especially in novel settings.

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a 3D representation that includes uncertainty attributes for each point, improving robustness in 3D object detection by leveraging raw LiDAR measurement uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in LiDAR-based 3D sensing, such as sparse or erroneous point clouds due to noisy measurements, which degrade downstream perception accuracy.

Method: Proposes PPC, augmenting point clouds with probability attributes for uncertainty, and introduces inference methods for robust 3D object detection.

Result: PPC-based methods outperform baselines in simulations and real captures, especially for small, distant, or low-albedo objects.

Conclusion: PPC enhances 3D perception by incorporating measurement uncertainty, offering a versatile and lightweight solution for robust object detection.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Modality Shifting (SMS) to quantify biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) toward text over images in medical tasks. It evaluates six VLMs on medical datasets, revealing a strong reliance on text despite visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of VLMs favoring text over images in clinical decision-making, which can overlook critical visual information.

Method: Uses SMS, a perturbation-based approach, to swap images or text between samples with opposing labels, exposing modality biases. Evaluates six VLMs on MIMIC-CXR and FairVLMed datasets.

Result: VLMs exhibit a strong dependency on text, overshadowing visual cues, even in models fine-tuned for medical data. Attention-based analysis confirms this bias.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for multimodal models that genuinely integrate both visual and textual information, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

### [9] [Graph Lineages and Skeletal Graph Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00197)
*Eric Mjolsness,Cory B. Scott*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical graph lineages for modeling architectures, with exponential growth and skeletal algebraic operations, applicable to machine learning and computational science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define structured graph lineages for hierarchical modeling, enabling efficient algebraic operations and applications in fields like machine learning and multigrid methods.

Method: Defines graph lineages with exponential growth, bipartite connections, and prolongation maps. Introduces skeletal algebraic operations and unary operators like thickening and escalation.

Result: Develops an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchical lineages, with applications in deep neural networks and multigrid methods.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for hierarchical model architectures and local algorithms, demonstrated in neural networks and numerical methods.

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for real personality recognition (RPR) by simulating personalized internal cognition from audio-visual behaviors, using a 2D-GNN for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RPR methods infer personality impressions from external behaviors, which often deviate from real personalities, leading to poor performance. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging internal cognition.

Method: The approach simulates personalized cognition from audio-visual behaviors, encodes it as a 2D graph, and uses a 2D-GNN for personality inference. An end-to-end training strategy is employed.

Result: The proposed method improves real personality recognition by focusing on internal cognition rather than external impressions.

Conclusion: The novel RPR approach effectively captures real personality traits by modeling internal cognition, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

### [11] [SAM-PTx: Text-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM with Parameter-Efficient, Parallel-Text Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00213)
*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx adapts SAM for semantic text prompts using frozen CLIP-derived embeddings, improving segmentation performance with minimal architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of semantic text prompts in SAM is underexplored compared to spatial prompts like points and boxes.

Method: Introduces a lightweight adapter, Parallel-Text, to inject CLIP-derived text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, modifying only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block.

Result: Incorporating fixed text embeddings improves segmentation performance on COD10K, COCO, and ADE20K datasets over spatial prompt baselines.

Conclusion: Semantic conditioning in SAM offers a practical and scalable adaptation method with low computational complexity.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating object positioning info improves few-shot image classification, with Segment Anything Model or unsupervised methods providing significant gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in few-shot image classification due to image ambiguities like multiple objects or complex backgrounds.

Method: Use additional local positioning info of objects, leveraging Segment Anything Model or unsupervised foreground extraction.

Result: Marked enhancement in classification performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple object localization methods can significantly boost few-shot classification accuracy.

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)
*Chenggang Guo,Hao Xu,XianMing Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSF-UM, a guided depth map super-resolution model combining Mamba's state-space modeling with a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are computationally expensive. The goal is to improve depth map super-resolution by efficiently modeling global context.

Method: Proposes MSF-UM, integrating Mamba's state-space modeling into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by color images. Uses residual dense channel attention blocks and Mamba modules for local and global feature extraction.

Result: MSF-UM reduces parameters and achieves better reconstruction accuracy than mainstream methods, validated on multiple datasets with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The MSF-UM model effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, excelling in large-scale depth map super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

### [14] [PointGauss: Point Cloud-Guided Multi-Object Segmentation for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00259)
*Wentao Sun,Hanqing Xu,Quanyun Wu,Dedong Zhang,Yiping Chen,Lingfei Ma,John S. Zelek,Jonathan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointGauss is a real-time multi-object segmentation framework for Gaussian Splatting, using point cloud guidance for efficiency and multi-view consistency. It outperforms existing methods and introduces a new dataset, DesktopObjects-360.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting suffer from slow initialization and lack of multi-view consistency.

Method: Uses a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder for fast 3D instance mask generation and a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system for consistency.

Result: Achieves 1.89 to 31.78% performance gains in multi-view mIoU while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: PointGauss is effective for real-time multi-object segmentation and is supported by the comprehensive DesktopObjects-360 dataset.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

### [15] [Instruction-Grounded Visual Projectors for Continual Learning of Generative Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00260)
*Hyundong Jin,Hyung Jin Chang,Eunwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) addresses the neglect of language instructions by grounding visual translation on instructions and using specialized visual projectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, especially with repetitive textual tasks, limiting model performance.

Method: Introduces a mixture of visual projectors as specialized experts, an expert recommendation strategy for task similarity, and expert pruning to reduce interference.

Result: Outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating better instruction-following responses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances visual and language inputs, improving continual learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

### [17] [Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00272)
*Wenyue Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions reveals performance drops in existing methods, highlights the robustness of large-scale vision models, and identifies task-specific needs for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic correspondence is crucial for computer vision tasks, but its robustness in challenging scenarios is understudied. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: A novel benchmark dataset with 14 challenging scenarios (e.g., distortion, blurring, artifacts, occlusion) was created. Evaluations compared existing methods, large-scale models (DINO, Stable Diffusion), and robustness strategies.

Result: (1) Performance drops in adverse conditions; (2) Large-scale models improve robustness, but fine-tuning reduces it; (3) DINO outperforms Stable Diffusion, and their fusion enhances robustness. Data augmentations are ineffective.

Conclusion: Task-specific designs are needed to improve semantic correspondence robustness, as general methods fail in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

*Tran Viet Khoa,Do Hai Son,Mohammad Abu Alsheikh,Yibeltal F Alem,Dinh Thai Hoang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for drowsiness detection using Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) and LSTM, with federated learning via Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC), achieves 89.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents, but detection is challenging due to decentralized and diverse facial data.

Method: Proposes SSA with LSTM for feature extraction and GSC for federated learning, plus a tool for automated video data processing.

Result: Achieves 89.9% accuracy in federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles real-world data variability and shows promise for enhancing road safety.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

### [19] [TITAN-Guide: Taming Inference-Time AligNment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00289)
*Christian Simon,Masato Ishii,Akio Hayakawa,Zhi Zhong,Shusuke Takahashi,Takashi Shibuya,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITAN-Guide proposes a memory-efficient, training-free method for guiding Text-to-Video diffusion models, improving control and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free guidance frameworks for diffusion models suffer from high memory usage or sub-optimal control, limiting their use in computationally intense tasks like Text-to-Video generation.

Method: TITAN-Guide optimizes diffusion latents without backpropagation using forward gradient descents and directional directives, reducing memory requirements.

Result: The method efficiently manages memory during latent optimization and enhances Text-to-Video performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide offers a practical solution for guiding diffusion models with minimal memory overhead and improved control.

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

### [20] [AniMer+: Unified Pose and Shape Estimation Across Mammalia and Aves via Family-Aware Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00298)
*Jin Lyu,Liang An,Li Lin,Pujin Cheng,Yebin Liu,Xiaoying Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AniMer+ introduces a unified approach for reconstructing mammals and birds using a high-capacity, family-aware ViT with MoE design and synthetic datasets to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower spatial intelligence and enable accurate animal pose and shape estimation across species, addressing limitations of previous methods and data scarcity.

Method: Uses a family-aware ViT with MoE design, partitioning layers into taxa-specific and shared components, and generates synthetic datasets (CtrlAni3D and CtrlAVES3D) for training.

Result: Superior performance on benchmarks, including the challenging Animal Kingdom dataset, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: AniMer+ effectively addresses data scarcity and network capacity issues, enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

*Danzhen Fu,Jiagao Hu,Daiguo Zhou,Fei Wang,Zepeng Wang,Wenhua Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios enhances robustness in pedestrian detection models by integrating video inpainting and human motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian detection models lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous scenarios in training datasets.

Method: Identify pedestrian regions, expand bounding boxes, resize and stitch into a unified canvas, apply a binary mask for editable areas, and guide editing with pose sequence control.

Result: Achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: The method is robust and versatile for multi-view pedestrian video generation, useful for data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

### [22] [Exploring Fourier Prior and Event Collaboration for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00308)
*Chunyan She,Fujun Han,Chengyu Fang,Shukai Duan,Lidan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method for low-light image enhancement using event cameras, decoupling the process into visibility restoration and structure refinement, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods underutilize modality-specific advantages, limiting performance. The paper aims to fully exploit these advantages by analyzing each sensing modality's role.

Method: The pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration (using a network with amplitude-phase entanglement in Fourier space) and structure refinement (using dynamic alignment fusion). A contrastive loss is also introduced for discriminative representations.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in experiments.

Conclusion: The decoupled two-stage approach effectively enhances low-light images by leveraging event camera advantages and dynamic alignment.

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR models struggle with the structural diversity and complexity of mathematical formulas in scientific literature.

Method: The approach uses general vision-language models and supervised fine-tuning on the CSFormula dataset, which includes diverse and complex formulas.

Result: The method outperforms specialized models in accuracy and robustness across various styles and domains.

Conclusion: DocTron-Formula sets a new standard for automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific
and general vision-language models often struggle to handle the structural
diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical
content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built
upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for
specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale
and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a
new paradigm for the automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GV-VAD, a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised framework for video anomaly detection, using synthetic videos to augment training data and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies limit VAD dataset scalability and model performance.

Method: Proposes GV-VAD, leveraging text-conditioned video generation models to create synthetic videos for training augmentation, with a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy.

Result: GV-VAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses dataset limitations and enhances VAD performance through synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

*Sunghyun Park,Seokeon Choi,Hyoungwoo Park,Sungrack Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes personalization guidance for text-to-image diffusion models to balance target fidelity and text editability, outperforming existing methods like CFG and AG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between aligning with target concepts and preserving original model knowledge in few-shot fine-tuning scenarios.

Method: Uses an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt and dynamically controls unlearning via weight interpolation during inference.

Result: Improves text alignment and target distribution fidelity without extra computational cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances adaptation and preservation, integrating well with fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

TL;DR: A practical method for calibrating camera spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating, outperforming traditional reference-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spectral sensitivity calibration is vital for tasks like color correction and material analysis, but existing methods need specialized equipment. This work aims to simplify the process.

Method: Uses an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet to capture images of direct and diffracted light, estimating spectral sensitivity and grating parameters in closed-form.

Result: Outperforms conventional reference target-based methods in synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The method is effective, practical, and accessible, requiring only off-the-shelf materials.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms
conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and
practicality.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across varied datasets and tasks.

Method: Uses a language-based PromptEngineer for task-specific prompts and a VisionReasoner (LVLM) for inference, fully automated and modular.

Result: Achieves high accuracy on tasks like TQA (99.13%), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L).

Conclusion: LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images with informative prompts, influenced by design choices like model selection.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

*Yan Gong,Mengjun Chen,Hao Liu,Gao Yongsheng,Lei Yang,Naibang Wang,Ziying Song,Haoqun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) for multi-object tracking (MOT) in autonomous vehicles, improving stability and accuracy by dynamically adapting to ego-vehicle speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT methods ignore ego-vehicle speed's impact on observation noise and reference frames, degrading tracking in dynamic scenarios.

Method: SG-LKF uses MotionScaleNet (MSNet) to predict parameters and a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss for better inter-frame association.

Result: SG-LKF achieves top performance on KITTI 2D MOT (79.59% HOTA) and KITTI 3D MOT (82.03% HOTA), and outperforms SimpleTrack on nuScenes 3D MOT.

Conclusion: The proposed SG-LKF effectively addresses speed-induced tracking challenges, enhancing MOT performance in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

*Zongheng Tang,Yi Liu,Yifan Sun,Yulu Gao,Jinyu Chen,Runsheng Xu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoST, a unified spatio-temporal collaborative perception method, improving efficiency and accuracy by merging multi-agent and multi-time fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods separate multi-agent and multi-time fusion, leading to inefficiencies like redundant feature transmission.

Method: CoST aggregates observations from different agents and times into a unified spatio-temporal space, enabling efficient feature transmission and superior fusion.

Result: CoST enhances perception performance, reduces transmission bandwidth, and is compatible with existing methods.

Conclusion: CoST offers a holistic, efficient, and accurate solution for collaborative perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

TL;DR: A machine learning method for classifying honey botanical origins using LDA for feature extraction and SVM/KNN for classification, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the classification of honey botanical origins using machine learning techniques.

Method: Three-step process: dataset preparation (class transformation), feature extraction (LDA), and classification (SVM/KNN).

Result: Achieved 95.13% accuracy for image-based and 92.80% for instance-based classification.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for honey botanical origin classification, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction by combining feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (generalization-based or overfitting-based) struggle with unseen views or limited geometry clues, leading to poor reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes SparseRecon, using volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraints to enhance reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with small overlapping views.

Conclusion: SparseRecon effectively addresses ambiguity and occlusion issues, producing high-quality geometry from sparse views.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

### [32] [Representation Shift: Unifying Token Compression with FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00367)
*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Representation Shift, a training-free metric for token compression in Transformers, compatible with FlashAttention, improving efficiency without attention maps or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the quadratic cost of self-attention and GPU memory overhead in large Transformer models by enabling token compression without reliance on attention maps.

Method: Proposes Representation Shift, a model-agnostic metric to measure token representation changes, integrating token compression with FlashAttention.

Result: Achieves speedups of up to 5.5% in video-text retrieval and 4.4% in video QA, demonstrating effective token compression.

Conclusion: Representation Shift offers a practical solution for efficient token compression, compatible with modern attention optimizations like FlashAttention.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

*Yuji Sato,Yasunori Ishii,Takayoshi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiAnt improves long-term action anticipation by combining forward and backward prediction with a large language model, outperforming unidirectional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of unidirectional approaches in capturing distinct sub-actions for better early risk detection in automated driving and robotics.

Method: Combines forward and backward prediction using a large language model to enhance feature extraction and prediction.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on Ego4D dataset, measured by edit distance.

Conclusion: BiAnt's bidirectional approach effectively improves long-term action anticipation performance.

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

*Kamal Basha S,Athira Nambiar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adapt-WeldNet, an adaptive framework for welding defect detection, and DDIA, an interpretability analysis framework, to improve performance and transparency in defect detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NDT methods and existing neural network approaches often fail to detect subtle defects or lack interpretability, posing safety risks in critical industries like oil and gas.

Method: The paper proposes Adapt-WeldNet for systematic evaluation of pre-trained architectures and transfer learning, and DDIA for interpretability using XAI techniques and expert validation.

Result: The framework enhances defect detection performance and provides actionable insights, while DDIA ensures reliability and transparency through expert-backed XAI techniques.

Conclusion: This work improves trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection, particularly in offshore and marine environments.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

*Won June Cho,Hongjun Yoon,Daeky Jeong,Hyeongyeol Lim,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid architecture combining state space models (SSMs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) for predicting spatial gene expression from histopathology images, outperforming ViT in robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and complexity of spatial transcriptomics limit clinical adoption, necessitating a practical alternative like predicting gene expression from histopathology images. Current ViT-based models underperform clinically.

Method: Proposes $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid SSM-ViT backbone, pretrained on colorectal cancer datasets using DINOv2. Evaluated against five other architectures in random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings.

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than ViT in LOSO evaluation and shows 43% smaller performance degradation. It also excels in classification, retrieval, and survival tasks.

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$ is a promising next-generation backbone for pathology vision foundation models, offering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

### [36] [Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00391)
*Guanjie Huang,Danny H. K. Tsang,Shan Yang,Guangzhi Lei,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cued-Agent, a collaborative multi-agent system for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition (ACSR), addressing challenges like temporal asynchrony and limited data by integrating specialized sub-agents for hand and lip recognition, dynamic fusion, and semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ACSR methods struggle with multimodal fusion due to temporal asynchrony and limited data, leading to suboptimal performance. Multi-agent systems offer potential for handling such complexities.

Method: Cued-Agent employs four sub-agents: Hand Recognition (using keyframe screening and expert prompts), Lip Recognition (Transformer-based), Hand Prompt Decoding (dynamic fusion), and Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word (semantic refinement).

Result: Cued-Agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios, validated on an expanded Mandarin CS dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent system effectively addresses ACSR challenges, demonstrating superior performance and offering a scalable solution for limited-data scenarios.

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

*Fei Zhang,Tianfei Zhou,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Ivor W. Tsang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAPT addresses the information asymmetry in prompt tuning by decoupling visual modality into foreground and background, aligning them with text, and using a pull-push regularization for unbiased attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies an overlooked issue in prompt tuning where visual modality dominates, leading to biased attention.

Method: Proposes DAPT, which decouples visual modality into foreground/background, aligns them with text, and applies visual pull-push regularization.

Result: DAPT achieves superior performance in few-shot learning, generalization, and data-efficient learning.

Conclusion: DAPT effectively balances modal alignment and attention, improving vision-language model performance.

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

TL;DR: A detection framework for AI-generated videos combines RGB appearance features and optical flow residuals to identify forgery by capturing spatial-temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos from diffusion models challenges existing forgery detection methods, which often miss fine-grained temporal inconsistencies.

Method: A dual-branch architecture analyzes RGB frames for appearance artifacts and optical flow residuals for motion anomalies, integrating both for detection.

Result: The method effectively detects forged videos, showing robustness and generalization across ten generative models in text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging spatial-temporal consistency for improved forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: iSafetyBench is a new video-language benchmark for evaluating vision-language models in industrial settings, focusing on routine and hazardous actions. Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, models struggle with iSafetyBench, highlighting the need for safety-aware improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in evaluating vision-language models for high-stakes industrial domains, where recognizing both routine and hazardous actions is critical, motivated the creation of iSafetyBench.

Method: The benchmark includes 1,100 real-world industrial video clips annotated with 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories, paired with multiple-choice questions for evaluation. Eight state-of-the-art models were tested under zero-shot conditions.

Result: Models performed poorly on iSafetyBench, especially in recognizing hazardous activities and multi-label scenarios, revealing significant gaps in safety-critical contexts.

Conclusion: iSafetyBench highlights the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models in industrial applications and serves as a testbed for future progress.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Efficiency Index (DEI) and a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration (PMR) framework to address turbulence-induced distortions in videos, achieving high-quality restoration with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to restore edge details and eliminate mixed distortions in videos affected by strong turbulence and complex dynamics.

Method: Proposes DEI to quantify video dynamic intensity and PMR, a three-stage framework (de-tilting, motion segmentation enhancement, de-blurring) using lightweight backbones and joint training.

Result: PMR effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details, and generalizes well in high-turbulence, dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The method outperforms existing approaches, with code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sortblock accelerates DiTs by dynamically caching block-wise features and skipping redundant computations, achieving 2x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs suffer from high inference latency due to sequential denoising, limiting real-time use. Existing methods overlook evolving semantic focus.

Method: Proposes Sortblock, a training-free framework that caches features based on similarity, ranks residuals, and uses linear prediction to reduce errors.

Result: Achieves over 2x speedup with minimal degradation in output quality across tasks and architectures.

Conclusion: Sortblock is an effective, generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-AE 1.5 improves high-resolution diffusion models by addressing slow convergence issues with structured latent space and augmented diffusion training, achieving better quality and faster performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the trade-off between reconstruction quality and generation quality in latent diffusion models caused by increasing latent channels.

Method: Introduces Structured Latent Space for channel-wise organization and Augmented Diffusion Training for faster convergence.

Result: DC-AE 1.5 outperforms DC-AE in generation quality and speed, e.g., 4x faster on ImageNet 512x512.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enable better scaling and performance in latent diffusion models.

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

*Sangwoo Youn,Minji Lee,Nokap Tony Park,Yeonggyoo Jeon,Taeyoung Na*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using video inpainting models for outpainting, introduces a hierarchical discriminator, and a specialized loss function to improve visual and global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video outpainting often produce blurry results when directly applying inpainting models. The paper aims to address this by enhancing discriminator designs and loss functions.

Method: The authors suggest differentiating adversarial training into global and local goals, introducing a hierarchical discriminator, and developing a specialized outpainting loss function.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The hierarchical discriminator and specialized loss function significantly improve video outpainting, producing visually appealing and coherent results.

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

TL;DR: UIS-Mamba introduces a Mamba-based model for underwater instance segmentation, addressing challenges like color distortion and blurred boundaries with Dynamic Tree Scan and Hidden State Weaken modules, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scenes pose unique challenges for instance segmentation, such as color distortion and blurred boundaries, which existing methods struggle to handle.

Method: Proposes UIS-Mamba with Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) for dynamic local receptive fields and Hidden State Weaken (HSW) to suppress background interference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UIIS and USIS10K datasets with low computational complexity.

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba effectively adapts Mamba for underwater tasks, offering a robust solution for underwater instance segmentation.

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

*Seunggeun Chi,Enna Sachdeva,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method improves amodal completion in human-object interactions by using physical priors and multi-regional inpainting, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with plausible completions in dynamic HOI scenarios due to limited understanding.

Method: Uses physical prior knowledge and multi-regional inpainting with customized denoising in a diffusion model.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, enhancing realism and accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach advances machine perception in dynamic environments and is robust without ground-truth annotations.

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

*M. A. P√©rez-Cuti√±o,J. Valverde,J. Capit√°n,J. M. D√≠az-B√°√±ez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AerialCSP, a synthetic dataset for CSP plant aerial imagery, to reduce manual labeling needs and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack domain-specific elements for CSP plants, making model generalization difficult without costly manual labeling.

Method: Creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset simulating CSP plant imagery, for pretraining models.

Result: Pretraining on AerialCSP improves real-world fault detection, especially for rare and small defects.

Conclusion: AerialCSP provides a practical solution for reducing manual labeling and enhancing model performance in CSP plant inspections.

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

*Jiale Zhou,Wenhan Wang,Shikun Li,Xiaolei Qu,Xin Guo,Yizhong Liu,Wenzhong Tang,Xun Lin,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoTTA is a test-time adaptation framework for tubular structure segmentation, addressing domain shifts by enhancing topological representation and continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts degrade performance in tubular structure segmentation (TSS), especially due to topological sensitivity and local feature variations.

Method: TopoTTA uses Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs) for topological adaptation and Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) for continuity improvement.

Result: TopoTTA improves performance by 31.81% in clDice across four scenarios and ten datasets.

Conclusion: TopoTTA effectively handles topological distribution shifts and is a plug-and-play solution for CNN-based TSS models.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

*Longfei Huang,Yu Liang,Hao Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Wei Dong,Lunde Chen,Wanyu Liu,Bo Li,Pengtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDMatte leverages diffusion models for interactive matting, improving fine-grained detail extraction and interaction via visual prompts, coordinate embeddings, and masked self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive matting methods lack precision in edge regions, while diffusion models offer robust capabilities for detail synthesis and interaction.

Method: SDMatte transforms text-driven diffusion model interactions into visual prompts, integrates coordinate and opacity embeddings into U-Net, and uses masked self-attention.

Result: Experiments show SDMatte outperforms other methods in interactive matting.

Conclusion: SDMatte effectively addresses fine-grained detail extraction in matting, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

*Hongyi Cai,Mohammad Mahdinur Rahman,Mingkang Dong,Jie Li,Muxin Pu,Zhili Fang,Yinan Peng,Hanjun Luo,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias is a framework that automatically detects and mitigates social biases in Text-to-Image models without prior knowledge of bias types, improving fairness while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models often exhibit unintended social biases, even when attributes aren't mentioned, and existing debiasing methods struggle with subtle or overlapping biases.

Method: AutoDebias uses vision-language models to detect biased patterns and generates inclusive prompts to guide a CLIP-based training process for fairer outputs.

Result: AutoDebias achieves 91.6% accuracy in detecting biases, reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, and preserves visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AutoDebias effectively addresses subtle and overlapping biases in T2I models, offering a scalable solution for fairness without compromising quality.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTime is a multimodal framework built on CLIP to predict fungal growth stages and timestamps from images and text, improving temporal modeling in biological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models like CLIP lack effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics, which is crucial for biological growth monitoring.

Method: CLIPTime extends CLIP to jointly predict developmental stages (classification) and timestamps (regression) using synthetic fungal growth data.

Result: CLIPTime successfully models biological progression and provides interpretable, time-aware predictions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of vision-language models for real-world biological monitoring applications.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

*Baisong Li,Xingwang Wang,Haixiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIF-Net is a fusion framework for multispectral and hyperspectral images, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task with invertible Mamba architecture and a lightweight Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information in MHIF makes the task ill-posed, and previous methods failed to address data misalignment effectively.

Method: PIF-Net uses an invertible Mamba architecture for global spectral modeling and introduces a Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module for dynamic feature calibration.

Result: PIF-Net achieves superior image restoration performance on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: PIF-Net effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of MHIF, balancing spectral and spatial information with computational efficiency.

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR models struggle with high fidelity alignment and temporal consistency due to limited control over the generation process.

Method: Incorporates semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in latent diffusion space to balance detail recovery and temporal coherence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in detail recovery and perceptual quality, preserving high-reality visual content.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR is effective for complex video super-resolution tasks, offering improved fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyPCV-Former is a hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos, outperforming benchmarks with 7% and 5.6% improvements on TIMo and DAD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean-based methods fail to capture hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity in video anomaly detection.

Method: Extracts spatial features from point cloud sequences, embeds them in Lorentzian hyperbolic space, and uses a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention mechanism for temporal modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements on TIMo (7%) and DAD (5.6%) datasets.

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former effectively addresses limitations of Euclidean methods by leveraging hyperbolic geometry for better anomaly detection.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: LAMIC is a training-free framework for multi-reference image synthesis, enhancing layout control and consistency with novel attention mechanisms and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating coherent images from multiple references with spatial layout awareness in controllable image synthesis.

Method: Extends single-reference diffusion models to multi-reference scenarios using Group Isolation Attention (GIA) and Region-Modulated Attention (RMA). Introduces metrics like IN-R, FI-R, and BG-S for evaluation.

Result: LAMIC outperforms existing methods in layout control, background consistency, and identity preservation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.

Conclusion: LAMIC sets a new training-free paradigm for multi-image composition, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization and scalability with evolving foundation models.

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

TL;DR: LesiOnTime improves small lesion segmentation in breast DCE-MRI by integrating longitudinal imaging and BI-RADS scores, outperforming baselines by 5% Dice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods focus on large lesions and ignore longitudinal and clinical data, which are crucial for early cancer detection.

Method: Proposes a 3D segmentation approach with Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) and BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) to mimic clinical workflows.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% Dice on a longitudinal dataset, with TPA and BCR providing complementary gains.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal and clinical context enhances early lesion segmentation, validating the clinical workflow approach.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: An unsupervised pipeline for labeling geographical areas in Sentinel-2 imagery using segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks, improving robustness and reducing labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling remote sensing imagery is costly and time-consuming, requiring expert input. Existing tools depend on pre-labeled data, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to group pixels by color and spatial similarity, encoding a robust feature space. Graph networks aggregate segment information for local and neighborhood context.

Result: Reduces labeling outliers, enables granular labeling, and forms rotationally invariant semantic relationships in the encoding space.

Conclusion: The unsupervised approach overcomes limitations of pre-labeled data dependency, offering a scalable and accurate solution for remote sensing imagery labeling.

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoMask, a pixel-level benchmark for spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos, addressing challenges like shorter object durations and sparser trajectories. It includes an automatic annotation pipeline and a training dataset (EgoMask-Train), showing significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing importance of egocentric videos in applications like augmented reality and robotics, coupled with the underexplored nature of this setting compared to exocentric videos, drives the need for better spatiotemporal grounding methods.

Method: The authors analyze discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, introduce EgoMask (a benchmark with automatic annotation), and create EgoMask-Train for model training. Experiments compare state-of-the-art models on this benchmark.

Result: Existing models perform poorly on EgoMask, but fine-tuning with EgoMask-Train improves performance significantly while maintaining exocentric dataset performance.

Conclusion: The work provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPANet, an efficient path aggregation network, improves underwater fish detection by combining complementary feature integration with lightweight design, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater fish detection is challenging due to low resolution, background interference, and target similarity. Existing methods are either inefficient or overly complex.

Method: EPANet uses an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network (EPA-FPN) for semantic-spatial complementarity and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP) for feature diversity.

Result: EPANet achieves higher detection accuracy and faster inference speed than state-of-the-art methods, with comparable or lower parameter complexity.

Conclusion: EPANet provides an effective and efficient solution for underwater fish detection, balancing performance and model simplicity.

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

*Seunghyun Shin,Dongmin Shin,Jisu Shin,Hae-Gon Jeon,Joon-Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reference-based video color grading framework using a diffusion model to generate LUTs for artistic color adjustments, preserving structural details and enabling fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify the complex and skill-intensive process of video color grading for artistic purposes, making it accessible beyond professionals.

Method: Generate LUTs via a diffusion model to align color attributes between reference scenes and input video, incorporating user preferences via text prompts.

Result: Effective color grading with preserved structural details and fast inference, validated by user studies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully democratizes video color grading, combining artistic intent with technical efficiency.

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly

### [62] [Your other Left! Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00549)
*Daniel Wolf,Heiko Hillenhagen,Billurvan Taskin,Alex B√§uerle,Meinrad Beer,Michael G√∂tz,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: State-of-the-art VLMs fail at determining relative positions in medical images, despite moderate improvements with visual prompts. A new benchmark dataset, MIRP, is introduced for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making requires accurate understanding of anatomical structures' relative positions, yet VLMs' capability in this area is underexplored.

Method: Evaluated VLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, JanusPro) and tested visual prompts (alphanumeric/colored markers) for performance enhancement.

Result: VLMs performed poorly on medical images, relying more on prior knowledge than image content. Visual prompts improved results slightly but not significantly.

Conclusion: VLMs lack fundamental capability for relative positioning in medical imaging. The MIRP dataset is introduced to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

### [63] [DBLP: Noise Bridge Consistency Distillation For Efficient And Reliable Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00552)
*Chihan Huang,Belal Alsinglawi,Islam Al-qudah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBLP introduces an efficient diffusion-based adversarial purification method using noise bridge distillation and adaptive semantic enhancement, achieving SOTA results with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and existing purification methods are inefficient due to iterative denoising.

Method: Proposes Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP) with noise bridge distillation and adaptive semantic enhancement.

Result: Achieves SOTA robust accuracy, superior image quality, and ~0.2s inference time.

Conclusion: DBLP advances real-time adversarial purification with efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

### [64] [HiPrune: Training-Free Visual Token Pruning via Hierarchical Attention in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00553)
*Jizhihui Liu,Feiyi Du,Guangdao Zhu,Niu Lian,Jun Li,Bin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPrune is a training-free, model-agnostic token pruning framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that leverages hierarchical attention to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of lengthy visual token sequences in VLMs without relying on special tokens or task-specific training.

Method: HiPrune identifies and prunes three types of tokens (Anchor, Buffer, Register) based on hierarchical attention in vision encoders, requiring no retraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% accuracy with 33.3% tokens and reducing FLOPs/latency by up to 9x.

Conclusion: HiPrune is scalable, efficient, and generalizable across VLMs, offering significant computational savings without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

### [65] [Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557)
*Qi Chen,Lingxiao Yang,Yun Chen,Nailong Zhao,Jianhuang Lai,Jie Shao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeCP is a training-free class purification framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, addressing class redundancy and visual-language ambiguity to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods for OVSS overlook challenges like class redundancy and visual-language ambiguity, leading to suboptimal results. FreeCP aims to purify semantic categories and rectify these errors.

Method: FreeCP purifies semantic categories by addressing redundancy and ambiguity, then uses these purified representations for segmentation predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks show FreeCP significantly enhances segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.

Conclusion: FreeCP effectively improves segmentation by tackling class redundancy and ambiguity, proving its value as a plug-and-play module in OVSS.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

*Jens U. Kreber,Joerg Stueckler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysNAP is a diffusion model-based method for generating physically plausible articulated objects aligned with partial point clouds, using SDFs and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects are common in everyday environments, but generating them with physical plausibility and alignment to partial point clouds is challenging.

Method: Uses SDFs for part shapes, guides diffusion with point cloud alignment loss, and enforces non-penetration and mobility constraints. Category-aware diffusion improves alignment.

Result: Evaluated on PartNet-Mobility, PhysNAP improves constraint consistency and offers a tradeoff with generative ability compared to unguided diffusion.

Conclusion: PhysNAP effectively generates physically plausible articulated objects with better alignment and constraint consistency.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

### [67] [Weakly Supervised Virus Capsid Detection with Image-Level Annotations in Electron Microscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00563)
*Hannah Kniesel,Leon Sick,Tristan Payer,Tim Bergner,Kavitha Shaga Devan,Clarissa Read,Paul Walther,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a weakly supervised object detection method using image-level annotations to avoid costly bounding box annotations, outperforming other weak labeling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoiding expensive and expert-dependent bounding box annotations for object detection by leveraging easier-to-acquire image-level labels.

Method: Uses a pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels via optimization with a shrinking receptive field, bypassing the need for specialized architectures.

Result: Pseudo-labels outperform other weak labeling methods and even ground truth labels when annotation time is limited.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces annotation costs while maintaining or improving detection performance.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

### [68] [CoProU-VO: Combining Projected Uncertainty for End-to-End Unsupervised Monocular Visual Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00568)
*Jingchao Xie,Oussema Dhaouadi,Weirong Chen,Johannes Meier,Jacques Kaiser,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoProU-VO introduces a novel method for unsupervised Visual Odometry by combining uncertainty across frames to improve pose estimation in dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic objects in scenes violate the static assumption of traditional VO methods, leading to errors in pose estimation. Uncertainty modeling is needed to filter out unreliable regions.

Method: The paper proposes CoProU-VO, an end-to-end approach using vision transformers to combine uncertainty from consecutive frames via probabilistic formulation, learning depth, uncertainty, and poses simultaneously.

Result: Experiments on KITTI and nuScenes show significant improvements over existing methods, especially in challenging highway scenes.

Conclusion: Cross-frame uncertainty propagation effectively enhances robustness in dynamic scenes, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

### [69] [Uncertainty-Aware Likelihood Ratio Estimation for Pixel-Wise Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00587)
*Marc H√∂lle,Walter Kellermann,Vasileios Belagiannis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation improves detection of unknown objects in semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, outperforming state-of-the-art with low false positives and high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to distinguish rare known objects from truly unknown ones in complex scenes, leading to confident misclassifications.

Method: An evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test is used, capturing uncertainty from rare training examples and synthetic outliers.

Result: Achieves 2.5% false positive rate and 90.91% precision on five benchmarks with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages uncertainty to improve unknown object detection, offering practical benefits for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code
is available at https://github.com/glasbruch/ULRE.

*Stefan Englmeier,Max A. B√ºttner,Katharina Winter,Fabian B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel context-aware motion retrieval framework is proposed for identifying rare human behaviors in autonomous driving datasets, improving retrieval accuracy by 27.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems need reliable evaluation in safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs, but rare behaviors are hard to retrieve in large datasets.

Method: Combines SMPL-based motion sequences and video frames into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language for text-based retrieval.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% in motion-context retrieval on the WayMoCo dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable retrieval of human behavior for robust autonomous driving evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

*Yihe Tian,Kwan Man Cheng,Zhengbo Zhang,Tao Zhang,Suju Li,Dongmei Yan,Bing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework (EVAL) reconstructs extended VIIRS-like NTL data for China, improving accuracy and temporal coverage (1986-2012).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NTL data lacks long-term coverage and suffers from intensity underestimation and structural omission.

Method: Two-stage process: Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) for initial reconstruction and Dual Feature Refiner (DFR) for refinement using impervious surface masks.

Result: EVAL outperforms existing products (R¬≤: 0.68‚Üí0.80, RMSE: 1.27‚Üí0.99) and maintains high socioeconomic correlation.

Conclusion: EVAL provides reliable, long-term NTL data for research, publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

*Mingrui Liu,Sixiao Zhang,Cheng Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wukong is a transformer-based NSFW detection framework for T2I generation, leveraging early denoising steps and pre-trained U-Net cross-attention for efficient and accurate detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NSFW safeguards (text or image filters) are either inefficient or prone to adversarial attacks, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Wukong uses intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's cross-attention parameters for early detection within the diffusion process.

Result: Wukong outperforms text-based safeguards and matches image filters' accuracy while being more efficient.

Conclusion: Wukong provides an effective and efficient solution for NSFW detection in T2I generation, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

*Jiajun Le,Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMoE introduces a Mixture-of-Experts framework for two-view geometry, addressing heterogeneous motion patterns with targeted modeling and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle diverse motion patterns in complex scenes, leading to inaccurate motion fields.

Method: Uses Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition and MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier to model heterogeneous sub-fields and assign experts for targeted refinement.

Result: GeoMoE achieves superior performance in relative pose and homography estimation with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively decouples and refines motion sub-fields, offering a streamlined solution for two-view geometry challenges.

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: DPoser-X is a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human poses, addressing challenges like pose complexity and dataset scarcity. It unifies pose tasks as inverse problems, uses variational diffusion sampling, and introduces novel training and scheduling methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior is challenging due to pose complexity and limited high-quality datasets.

Method: Introduces DPoser, a diffusion model for pose prior, extended to DPoser-X. Uses variational diffusion sampling, truncated timestep scheduling, and masked training to combine datasets.

Result: DPoser-X outperforms state-of-the-art models in body, hand, face, and full-body pose benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPoser-X sets a new benchmark for whole-body human pose prior modeling, demonstrating robustness and versatility.

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems in unconstrained environments face challenges like inconsistent lighting and poses, requiring robust face detection and alignment.

Method: The study introduces Face Generation Attacks and a Landmark Shift Attack to exploit vulnerabilities in face detection systems.

Result: The attacks successfully backdoor the coordinate regression task in face detectors, demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in face detection and offers mitigations to address these security risks.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture
images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face
poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that
regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face

a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a generative Diffusion Model to synthesize attribute-annotated medical images, addressing the scarcity of such datasets. This enhances explainable AI models, improving attribute and target prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust and usability of AI in medical diagnosis by aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning through pathology-related visual attributes.

Method: Enhance a Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning, train it on a small dataset (20 samples), and use its synthetic images to train an explainable model.

Result: Attribute prediction accuracy increased by 13.4%, and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to using only the small real dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can overcome dataset limitations, boosting the practicality of explainable models in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating defenses against patch attacks on object detectors, revealing key insights and improving defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense evaluations lack a unified framework, leading to inconsistent assessments of methods.

Method: Revisits 11 defenses, creates a benchmark with 2 attack goals, 13 attacks, 11 detectors, and 4 metrics, and builds a large-scale dataset.

Result: New insights include the role of data distribution in defense difficulty, the importance of attacked object precision, and robustness of complex/stochastic defenses.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides guidance for evaluating and designing patch attack defenses, with ongoing updates planned.

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

*Hongfei Zhang,Kun Zhou,Ruizheng Wu,Jiangbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using pretrained depth representations for image dehazing, proposing a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module adaptable to various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dehazing methods lack adaptability across diverse scenarios due to architecture-specific designs.

Method: Systematically investigates pretrained depth representations and introduces a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module.

Result: The learned depth features remain consistent across haze levels, and the module proves effective in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is versatile and effective for image dehazing across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

*Chende Zheng,Ruiqi suo,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Shuai Liu,Minghui Yang,Cong Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D3, a training-free method for detecting AI-generated videos by analyzing second-order temporal artifacts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public concern over synthetic video dissemination and limitations of current detection methods in exploring temporal artifacts.

Method: Proposes Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), leveraging second-order dynamical analysis and temporal discrepancies.

Result: D3 outperforms previous methods by 10.39% mean Average Precision on Gen-Video and shows computational efficiency.

Conclusion: D3 is a robust, efficient solution for detecting AI-generated videos, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

### [80] [MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00726)
*Jiale Li,Mingrui Wu,Zixiang Jin,Hao Chen,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIHBench, a benchmark for evaluating object-related hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs, identifies key factors causing hallucinations, and proposes a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism to mitigate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on hallucinations in MLLMs focus on single-image settings, leaving multi-image scenarios unexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors create MIHBench with three tasks to evaluate hallucinations. They analyze factors causing hallucinations and propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism.

Result: Key findings include the relationship between image inputs and hallucinations, and the proposed method reduces hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of multi-image hallucinations and offers an effective solution to improve MLLM performance in such scenarios.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

TL;DR: YOLO-Count is a differentiable model for open-vocabulary object counting and precise quantity control in text-to-image generation, using a novel 'cardinality' map and hybrid supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address general counting challenges and enable precise quantity control in text-to-image generation.

Method: Uses a 'cardinality' map for regression, representation alignment, and hybrid strong-weak supervision. Fully differentiable for gradient-based optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy and robust quantity control for T2I systems.

Conclusion: YOLO-Count effectively bridges open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control with high accuracy.

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

*Adwait Chandorkar,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone for 3D object detection, reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object detection methods rely on complex backbones, limiting efficiency. Lightweight designs are under-explored in 3D detection.

Method: Proposes Dense Backbone, a lightweight architecture, and integrates it with existing detectors like PillarNet.

Result: DensePillarNet reduces parameters by 29%, latency by 28%, with only a 2% accuracy drop on nuScenes.

Conclusion: Dense Backbone offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient 3D object detection without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

*Regine Hartwig,Dominik Muhle,Riccardo Marin,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GECO introduces a self-supervised vision model that learns geometrically coherent features, improving semantic and geometric correspondence tasks with a lightweight, efficient architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised vision models lack 3D geometry awareness, limiting their ability to distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g., left/right eyes).

Method: GECO uses an optimal transport-based training framework to enable supervision beyond keypoints, handling occlusions and disocclusions.

Result: GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance on PFPascal, APK, and CUB datasets, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively, and runs at 30 fps (98.2% faster than prior methods).

Conclusion: PCK alone is insufficient for geometric quality; GECO introduces new metrics for geometry-aware feature learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

*Laura Pedrouzo-Rodriguez,Pedro Delgado-DeRobles,Luis F. Gomez,Ruben Tolosana,Ruben Vera-Rodriguez,Aythami Morales,Julian Fierrez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using facial motion patterns as behavioral biometrics for identity verification in photorealistic avatar-mediated scenarios, proposing a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network with 80% AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the security risks of avatar impersonation in virtual communication by verifying identity through unique facial motion patterns.

Method: Introduces a dataset of genuine/impostor avatar videos and a spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network with temporal attention pooling using facial landmarks.

Result: Facial motion cues achieve ~80% AUC for identity verification, demonstrating reliability.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar systems, providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

*Prerana Ramkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN enhances satellite imagery SR by integrating ESRGAN, segmentation loss, and uncertainty maps, addressing semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence in SR, limiting their use in critical remote sensing applications.

Method: Combines ESRGAN, DeepLabv3 for segmentation loss, and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty maps.

Result: Achieves comparable PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS to Baseline ESRGAN, with better adaptation to domain-aligned datasets.

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN is effective for satellite and UAV imagery, emphasizing domain-aware training for optimal performance.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

*Irene Iele,Francesco Di Feola,Valerio Guarrasi,Paolo Soda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework is proposed for medical image-to-image translation, dynamically adjusting the process to handle out-of-distribution samples without degrading performance on in-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples in medical image-to-image translation without performance degradation.

Method: Introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block to selectively modify features of a pretrained model.

Result: Consistent improvements in low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation tasks over baseline and prior TTA methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sample-specific adjustment improves model resilience, outperforming uniform adaptation methods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

*Zihan Wang,Samira Ebrahimi Kahou,Narges Armanfard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PILOT introduces a dual-branch prompt learning mechanism and label-free test-time adaptation to improve zero-shot anomaly detection under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSAD methods struggle with domain shifts due to limited training data and lack of generalization to new distributions.

Method: PILOT uses a dual-branch prompt learning mechanism and label-free test-time adaptation with pseudo-labels.

Result: PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 benchmarks for anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

Conclusion: PILOT effectively addresses domain shift challenges in ZSAD, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines semantic segmentation in point-cloud datasets for public safety, highlighting challenges like class imbalance and label unification, and suggests standardization and improved labeling for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in unifying heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets for public safety applications, particularly in semantic segmentation of safety-relevant features.

Method: Uses NIST's Point Cloud City dataset with a graded schema and KPConv architecture, evaluating performance via IoU metrics.

Result: Performance varies: large objects (e.g., stairs) segment well, while smaller safety-critical features perform poorly due to class imbalance and geometric limitations.

Conclusion: Standardized annotation and improved labeling techniques are needed for reliable semantic segmentation in public safety applications.

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

*Wenxuan Guo,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Ziwei Wang,Jianjiang Feng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGL-Nav is a novel framework for image-goal navigation using incremental 3D Gaussian localization, outperforming existing methods by efficiently combining coarse geometric matching and fine pose optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for image-goal navigation struggle to model the geometric relationship between the 3D environment and the goal image, leading to inefficiency and inaccuracy.

Method: IGL-Nav incrementally updates a 3D Gaussian scene representation, uses coarse geometric matching for goal localization, and refines the pose with differentiable rendering.

Result: IGL-Nav significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and handles free-view image-goal navigation, even on real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: IGL-Nav provides an efficient and accurate solution for 3D-aware image-goal navigation, advancing the field with its incremental and optimization-based approach.

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:
