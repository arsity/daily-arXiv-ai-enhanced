### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate VR training content generation, reducing development time and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR training is effective but resource-intensive to develop. Automating content creation can address this challenge.

Method: A system with an LLM module extracts task info from text, and an intelligent module converts it into VR animations and visual cues.

Result: The approach improves training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR training more scalable.

Conclusion: Automating VR training content with LLMs offers a scalable solution for industrial training needs.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD) algorithm to improve circle fitting accuracy by detecting and removing noisy points. It outperforms other methods in industrial washer part measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy point sets compromise circle fitting effectiveness, necessitating robust outlier detection methods for industrial applications like quality control.

Method: The PCOD algorithm transforms points to polar coordinates, computes local and global standard deviations, and identifies outliers by comparing local means with global deviation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms ten circle fitting algorithms and five outlier detection methods, achieving higher accuracy in industrial washer part measurements.

Conclusion: PCOD enhances circle fitting accuracy in noisy environments, proving its potential for industrial quality control and design applications.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods (conversion factor-based and pixel-based) to improve measurement accuracy in camera systems using known reference parts, reducing errors from 13-114µm to 1-2µm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement errors in camera systems persist despite specialized equipment, especially when measuring parts of varying diameters.

Method: Two approaches: conversion factor estimation and pixel-based diameter estimation using known references.

Result: Errors reduced from 13-114µm to 1-2µm in tests on glass and metal samples.

Conclusion: The methods significantly enhance accuracy and reliability in diameter measurements using minimal reference parts.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Result: Substantial performance improvements on the MER2024 benchmark, showing synergy between MLLM reasoning and lightweight fusion networks.

Conclusion: MLLM-derived reasoning combined with balanced learning enhances robustness and scalability in emotion recognition.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify and segment sound-producing
objects in videos by leveraging both visual and audio modalities. It has
emerged as a significant research area in multimodal perception, enabling
fine-grained object-level understanding. In this survey, we present a

provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

### [6] [A Large Language Model Powered Integrated Circuit Footprint Geometry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03725)
*Yida Wang,Taiting Lu,Runze Liu,Lanqing Yang,Yifan Yang,Zhe Chen,Yuehai Wang,Yixin Liu,Kaiyuan Lin,Xiaomeng Chen,Dian Ding,Yijie Li,Yi-Chao Chen,Yincheng Jin,Mahanth Gowda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4-IC8K, a framework using LLMs for automated IC footprint geometry labeling from mechanical drawings, addressing challenges in visual perception and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parsing of IC footprint geometry is challenging due to unstructured drawings and lack of existing methods, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: Proposes LLM4-IC8K, a two-stage framework: trains LMMs on synthetic data for geometric reasoning, then fine-tunes on real-world data. Introduces ICGeo8K dataset for validation.

Result: LLM4-IC8K outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs in footprint geometry labeling, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of current LMMs in IC footprint geometry understanding, offering a scalable solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

*Tai Hyoung Rhee,Dong-guw Lee,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for denoising thermal infrared (TIR) images using latent-space and wavelet-domain optimization, achieving superior performance and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR images suffer from non-uniform noise, hindering robotic perception tasks in poor visibility. Addressing this improves object detection, localization, and mapping.

Method: Leverages a pretrained stable diffusion model, fine-tuned with a novel loss combining latent-space and wavelet-domain (DWT/DTCWT) losses, plus cascaded refinement for detail enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on benchmarks and shows strong zero-shot generalization to real-world TIR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for practical robotic deployment, offering high-fidelity denoising and robust performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

### [8] [What is Beneath Misogyny: Misogynous Memes Classification and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03732)
*Kushal Kanwar,Dushyant Singh Chauhan,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Misogyny, a multimodal approach to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes using text and image analysis with a cross-attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting and understanding misogyny in memes due to their multimodal and nuanced nature.

Method: Separate processing of text and image modalities, unified via cross-attention, followed by classification and explanation using a classifier and LLM.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, detecting and classifying misogyny into four categories (Kitchen, Leadership, Working, Shopping) and providing granular explanations.

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny offers an effective solution for identifying and analyzing misogynistic memes, with potential societal impact.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

### [9] [StorySync: Training-Free Subject Consistency in Text-to-Image Generation via Region Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03735)
*Gopalji Gaur,Mohammadreza Zolfaghari,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free method for consistent subject generation in visual storytelling using text-to-image diffusion models, avoiding computational costs of fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of maintaining subject consistency in visual storytelling without disrupting pre-trained model capabilities.

Method: Uses masked cross-image attention sharing and Regional Feature Harmonization to align and refine subject features dynamically.

Result: Successfully generates visually consistent subjects across diverse scenarios while preserving model creativity.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient, avoids retraining, and maintains the diffusion model's existing abilities.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

### [10] [Fusion of Pervasive RF Data with Spatial Images via Vision Transformers for Enhanced Mapping in Smart Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03736)
*Rafayel Mkrtchyan,Armen Manukyan,Hrant Khachatrian,Theofanis P. Raptis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using DINOv2 and RF data improves building mapping accuracy, outperforming baselines with a 65.3% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional smart city mapping techniques (cost, accessibility, accuracy) and biases in open-source maps by integrating RF data.

Method: Combines open-source maps with RF data using a vision transformer (DINOv2) to capture spatial dependencies and structural priors.

Result: Achieves 65.3% IoU, outperforming erroneous maps (40.1%), RF-only (37.3%), and non-AI fusion (42.2%).

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances mapping accuracy by leveraging multimodal data and deep learning, proving effective for smart city applications.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

### [11] [VQ-DeepISC: Vector Quantized-Enabled Digital Semantic Communication with Channel Adaptive Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03740)
*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VQ-DeepISC, a digital semantic communication system using vector quantization and deep learning for efficient, robust image transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in digitizing semantic features while preserving continuity and context, ensuring robustness to channel degradation.

Method: Proposes a VQ-enabled system with a Swin Transformer backbone for feature extraction, VQ modules for discrete latent spaces, and an attention-driven channel adaptation module. Uses KLD regularization and EMA for stable training.

Result: Superior reconstruction fidelity compared to benchmarks, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC effectively addresses semantic feature digitization challenges, offering practical benefits for digital communication systems.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

*Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Maosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a weakly supervised deep learning model for geospatial object detection, addressing challenges like lack of training data and spatial neglect in AI. It introduces spatially explicit methods, attention maps, and multistage training, applied to detect Mars craters and generalize to Earth and planetary features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in GeoAI, such as limited training data and overlooked spatial principles, to improve AI's integration with geospatial research.

Method: Develops a weakly supervised deep learning model using spatially explicit methods (Tobler's first law), attention maps, and multistage training.

Result: Successfully detects natural features like Mars craters and generalizes to Earth and planetary surfaces, reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: Advances GeoAI's theoretical and methodological foundations by integrating spatial principles and improving object detection.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

*Riccardo Fiorista,Awad Abdelhalim,Anson F. Stewart,Gabriel L. Pincus,Ian Thistle,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using CCTV footage and computer vision to estimate urban rail platform occupancy, comparing three methods and introducing a novel linear-optimization approach for accurate counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving safety, efficiency, and customer experience by enabling real-time crowding estimation for transit agencies.

Method: Three computer vision approaches (object detection, crowd-level classification, semantic segmentation) and a novel linear-optimization method for count extraction.

Result: Computer vision methods, tested on a large WMATA dataset, proved effective for real-time crowd estimation.

Conclusion: CCTV data alone can enable precise real-time crowding estimation, aiding timely operational responses.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular deep-learning framework for weed segmentation in drone videos dynamically routes degraded images to specialized transformer models, outperforming CNN-based methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate weed segmentation in precision agriculture, addressing common image degradation issues like blur and noise.

Method: A quality-aware framework analyzes image degradation (blur/noise) and routes inputs to specialized transformer models (baseline, noise-reducing, or blur-correcting).

Result: Outperforms CNN-based methods in segmentation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances deep-learning applications in agriculture by effectively handling degraded drone imagery.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

*Bevin V,Ananthakrishnan P V,Ragesh KR,Sanjay M,Vineeth S,Bibin Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic invoice documents to overcome dataset limitations in machine learning for invoice processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of acquiring large-scale, diverse datasets due to privacy and annotation costs.

Method: Uses OCR for layout extraction, LLM for synthetic content, and inpainting to replace text, creating realistic synthetic invoices.

Result: Produces visually realistic invoice images and aligned structured data (JSON) for training robust models.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, automated solution to enhance small datasets for improved document intelligence models.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Motivation: Existing RFT-based IQA methods lack supervision for the 'think' process and direct fine-tuning limits performance. Refine-IQA addresses these gaps.

Method: Stage-1: Uses Refine-Perception-20K dataset and multi-task rewards to improve visual perception. Stage-2: Introduces probability difference rewards for 'think' process supervision.

Result: Refine-IQA achieves top performance in perception and scoring tasks, with strong 'think' capability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances IQA by addressing supervision gaps and improving perception, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-PreNet, a deep-learning pipeline, addresses data preprocessing bottlenecks in 4D-STEM by integrating denoising, center correction, and distortion calibration, improving accuracy and reliability for automated analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput 4D-STEM faces challenges like noise, beam drift, and distortions, which bias measurements. Current solutions are material-specific and lack generalizability.

Method: Uses attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures trained on simulated datasets for denoising, center correction, and distortion calibration.

Result: Reduces mean squared error by 50% in denoising, achieves sub-pixel center localization (errors <0.04 pixels), and outperforms traditional algorithms.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet enables reliable, high-throughput 4D-STEM real-time analysis, enhancing automated characterization.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

TL;DR: HPSv3 introduces a human-centric metric for text-to-image generation, leveraging a large dataset (HPDv3) and a VLM-based model with uncertainty-aware ranking loss. CoHP refines images iteratively using HPSv3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-centric metrics for text-to-image models lack data coverage, feature extraction, and efficient loss functions.

Method: (1) Release HPDv3 dataset (1.08M text-image pairs, 1.17M comparisons). (2) Train VLM-based model with uncertainty-aware ranking loss. (3) Propose CoHP for iterative refinement.

Result: HPSv3 is a robust metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation; CoHP improves image quality without extra data.

Conclusion: HPSv3 and CoHP provide efficient, human-aligned solutions for evaluating and enhancing text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework for automated crater detection using CNNs, YOLO, and ResNet-50, achieving balanced performance with YOLO and high precision for large craters with ResNet-50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impact craters are key for planetary research, and automated detection using deep learning can enhance efficiency and accuracy in analyzing their spatial and morphological features.

Method: A two-stage approach: first, crater identification using CNNs, ResNet-50, and YOLO; second, YOLO-based detection for localization. Applied to Mars and Moon remote sensing data.

Result: YOLO provides balanced detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Conclusion: The framework effectively automates crater detection, with YOLO and ResNet-50 offering complementary strengths for different crater types.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

*Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Ifrah Zawar,P. Thomas Fletcher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model for generating point-based shapes with preserved correspondences, outperforming existing methods and applied to tasks like conditional generation and disease progression prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep generative models for point clouds ignore point correspondences, limiting their utility for tasks requiring shape consistency. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model trained on OASIS-3 data to generate realistic point-based shapes while preserving correspondences.

Result: Generates highly realistic hippocampal shapes with preserved correspondences, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges the gap in deep learning for correspondence-preserving shape generation, with practical applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

*Xiangcen Wu,Shaheer U. Saeed,Yipei Wang,Ester Bonmati Coll,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A recommendation system for prostate cancer segmentation suggests optimal imaging modalities and regions, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists use varied strategies for medical image analysis, but current machine learning models lack dynamic decision-making. This paper aims to enhance segmentation by mimicking radiologist strategies.

Method: A policy network recommends imaging modalities and regions for review, iteratively refining segmentation with a pre-trained model.

Result: The method outperforms standard segmentation networks and improves efficiency, especially for challenging cases. The policy network also developed unique strategies.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for interactive applications, assisting radiologists and potentially improving clinical guidelines.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: A two-stage training method reduces reliance on manual curation for audio-synchronized visual animation, using noisy pretraining and small-scale fine-tuning, achieving scalability and improved synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly manual curation of high-quality videos, limiting scalability. The goal is to reduce human effort while maintaining performance.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) pretrain on noisy, large-scale videos for diverse alignments, (2) fine-tune on small, high-quality datasets. Uses multi-feature conditioning and window attention for synchronization.

Result: Reduces manual curation by 10x, generalizes to 48 classes (3x more diverse than benchmarks), and introduces AVSync48 for evaluation.

Conclusion: The method efficiently scales audio-synchronized animation with minimal human effort, leveraging noisy data and small high-quality datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

*Mamadou Keita,Wassim Hamidouche,Hessen Bougueffa Eutamene,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAVID is a novel framework for detecting AI-generated images using visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods lack generalization and robustness, relying on low-level artifacts. RAVID aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging visual RAG.

Method: RAVID uses a fine-tuned CLIP encoder (RAVID CLIP) with category prompts, retrieves relevant images, and integrates a VLM to enrich input for detection.

Result: RAVID achieves 93.85% accuracy on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark and outperforms traditional methods under image degradations (80.27% vs. 63.44%).

Conclusion: RAVID demonstrates superior performance and robustness, making it a promising solution for AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Michele Andrade,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on deep learning models for estimating food nutrition from 2D images, finding proprietary datasets outperform public ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nutritional estimation from images is challenging due to variability in food presentation and lack of depth information, with reproducibility issues from reliance on proprietary datasets.

Method: Fine-tuning Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on ImageNet and COYO, comparing them against CNN baselines and a state-of-the-art method using JFT-300M, evaluated on Nutrition5k dataset.

Result: JFT-300M pre-trained models outperform public dataset models; COYO unexpectedly underperforms ImageNet, highlighting pre-training dataset characteristics' importance.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset scale, domain relevance, and curation quality are critical for effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

### [25] [JanusNet: Hierarchical Slice-Block Shuffle and Displacement for Semi-Supervised 3D Multi-Organ Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03997)
*Zheng Zhang,Tianzhuzi Tan,Guanchun Yin,Bo Zhang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusNet is a data augmentation framework for 3D medical image segmentation that preserves anatomical continuity while targeting hard-to-segment regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised medical image segmentation suffers from limited training data and disrupted anatomical continuity in existing augmentation methods.

Method: JanusNet combines Slice-Block Shuffle (aligned shuffling preserving anatomical context) and Confidence-Guided Displacement (focusing on hard regions).

Result: Achieves a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: JanusNet effectively leverages anatomical continuity and improves segmentation, especially in challenging regions.

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Motivation: To address slow CAD rendering and costly VLM deployments, ensuring robust and efficient CAD generation from text.

Method: Uses Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) for fast rewards and Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM) for verification, optimizing alignment via prospect theory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAD datasets with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge enhances Text-to-CAD systems by providing verifiable rewards and robust validation, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S²Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) to reduce computational costs. It uses salient data selection and sparse token distillation to address calibration variance and learning challenges, achieving lossless performance under W4A6 quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of video diffusion models due to large parameter sizes and long token sequences motivates the need for efficient quantization methods.

Method: Proposes S²Q-VDiT, leveraging Hessian-aware salient data selection for calibration and attention-guided sparse token distillation to handle learning challenges.

Result: Achieves lossless performance with 3.9× model compression and 1.3× inference acceleration under W4A6 quantization.

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT effectively addresses the challenges of quantizing V-DMs, offering significant computational savings without performance loss.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISEval, a framework to evaluate LMMs' ability to detect flawed inputs, revealing their struggles without guidance and varying performance across error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs, a gap in current research.

Method: Developed ISEval, a framework with seven flawed premise categories and three metrics, evaluated on ten advanced LMMs.

Result: Most models fail to detect flawed inputs without guidance; performance varies by error type and modality trust.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to improve LMMs' proactive input verification and offers insights for mitigation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDSSNet improves semantic segmentation in remote sensing by addressing high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity through adaptive prototypes and semantic-structure coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to unify class representations and distinguish similar features, while class-guided approaches neglect structural information.

Method: PDSSNet uses three modules: APEM for unbiased prototypes, SSCM for semantic-structure coordination, and CSAM for discriminative feature adjustment.

Result: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: PDSSNet effectively combines invariant semantics and variant spatial structure for precise segmentation.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

TL;DR: DCAR introduces a dual-prompt learning framework for Image-Text Retrieval, enhancing fine-grained representation by dynamically adjusting prompts and jointly optimizing attribute and class features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt learning excels in tasks like image classification but struggles with Image-Text Retrieval due to fine-grained attribute and subcategory discrimination challenges.

Method: DCAR dynamically updates attribute weights via text-image mutual information and introduces negative samples with category-matching weighting.

Result: DCAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FDRD benchmark, covering 1,500 fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs.

Conclusion: DCAR effectively addresses fine-grained ITR challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

### [31] [Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04033)
*Hee-Yeun Kim,Byeonggyu Park,Byonghyok Choi,Hansang Cho,Byungkwan Kim,Soomok Lee,Mingu Jeon,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining monocular camera images and 2D radar point clouds to detect pedestrians in NLoS scenarios caused by parked vehicles, improving road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLoS blind spots due to parked vehicles pose safety risks, especially with sudden pedestrian appearances. Existing methods lack generalizability due to reliance on predefined spatial data.

Method: Integrates monocular camera image segmentation for parked vehicle detection with 2D radar PCD for precise spatial inference.

Result: The framework enhances early pedestrian detection in real-world urban environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves NLoS pedestrian localization and road safety by dynamically adapting to real-time conditions.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

TL;DR: CORE-ReID V2 enhances its predecessor by addressing UDA challenges in Person, Vehicle, and Object ReID. It uses CycleGAN for synthetic data and an advanced fusion mechanism (ECAB/SECAB) for better feature representation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in ReID tasks by bridging domain gaps and enhancing feature representation.

Method: Uses CycleGAN for synthetic data pre-training and an ensemble fusion mechanism (ECAB/SECAB) for fine-tuning to improve feature representation and pseudo-label accuracy.

Result: Achieves top performance in mAP and Rank-k accuracy on UDA Person and Vehicle ReID datasets, supporting lightweight backbones like ResNet18/34.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2 advances UDA-based Object ReID, providing a scalable and efficient framework for future research.

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingling Liu,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet addresses efficiency bottlenecks in dark image restoration by eliminating external priors, optimizing frequency processing, and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from inefficiency due to reliance on external priors, redundant multi-stage pipelines, and indiscriminate frequency processing.

Method: SPJFNet uses a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) for lightweight endogenous guidance, lossless wavelet decomposition, and joint Fourier-based enhancement. It also employs a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) for specialized high/low frequency processing.

Result: SPJFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity and computational demands.

Conclusion: SPJFNet offers an efficient and high-performance solution for dark image restoration, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualTrans is a new benchmark for Visual Transformation Reasoning (VTR) addressing sim-to-real gaps and task complexity, featuring 12 tasks and 472 QA pairs. It evaluates spatial, procedural, and quantitative reasoning, revealing weaknesses in dynamic reasoning for state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTR benchmarks lack real-world applicability due to sim-to-real gaps, limited complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage.

Method: VisualTrans introduces a scalable pipeline using first-person videos, automated annotation, and human verification to create 12 tasks with 472 QA pairs.

Result: Models perform well in static spatial tasks but struggle with dynamic, multi-step reasoning, especially in intermediate state recognition and sequence planning.

Conclusion: VisualTrans highlights gaps in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, guiding future research for more capable VTR systems.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPA-CP introduces a novel SSL method for tumor segmentation in CT scans, combining adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods neglect small or numerous tumors and lack thorough investigation of data augmentation for labeled/unlabeled data.

Method: IPA-CP uses a two-way uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-label transition for robust pseudo labels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods on in-house and public datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: IPA-CP effectively addresses challenges in tumor segmentation, offering a robust and informative SSL framework.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

### [36] [Motion is the Choreographer: Learning Latent Pose Dynamics for Seamless Sign Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04049)
*Jiayi He,Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-phase framework for sign language video generation decouples motion semantics from signer identity, enabling high-quality synthesis with minimal data and flexible signer personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of excessive signer-specific data and poor generalization in sign language video generation.

Method: A two-phase synthesis: (1) constructing a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon, and (2) discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis with identity-aware neural rendering.

Result: Disentangling motion from identity enables high-quality synthesis and unprecedented signer personalization flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm is viable and advantageous, offering improved synthesis quality and adaptability.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

*Jitong Liao,Yulu Gao,Shaofei Huang,Jialin Gao,Jie Lei,Ronghua Liang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DOMR framework for dense object matching between egocentric and exocentric views, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence is crucial for visual understanding but challenging due to differences in perspectives.

Method: The DOMR framework includes a Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module that models multiple objects jointly, leveraging positional and semantic relationships, and a mask refinement head for improved accuracy.

Result: DOMR achieves mean IoU scores of 49.7% (Ego→Exo) and 55.2% (Exo→Ego), outperforming previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of DOMR effectively addresses cross-view object correspondence, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

*Chen Luo,Qiyu Jin,Taofeng Xie,Xuemei Wang,Huayu Wang,Congcong Liu,Liming Tang,Guoqing Chen,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Dong Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework for k-space interpolation in MRI, combining global predictability with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for k-space interpolation focus on local predictability, missing global dependencies. Transformers, though effective, lack interpretability.

Method: GPI-WT uses a structured low-rank model (SLR) with learnable global annihilation filters, unfolding optimization into a cascaded network for interpretability.

Result: GPI-WT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and provides superior interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating global dependencies and interpretability.

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff is a unified document restoration model using diffusion, scalable across tasks with learnable prompts and a Prior Pool for feature synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of task-specific models and limited scalability in unified approaches for document restoration.

Method: Uses diffusion with learnable task prompts, a Prior Pool for local/global features, and a Prior Fusion Module for adaptive task-specific priors.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific models while scaling seamlessly to new tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff offers a scalable, efficient solution for multi-task document restoration.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCSAFormer, an efficient medical image segmentation network, addresses limitations of transformer-based methods by introducing Compressed Attention (CA) and Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) modules, achieving better performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation face high computational complexity and limited local contextual feature capture.

Method: TCSAFormer uses a Compressed Attention module to reduce complexity and a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network to enhance local and multiscale feature capture.

Result: TCSAFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse datasets with lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer provides an efficient and accurate solution for medical image segmentation, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces O-Bench, a VQA benchmark for occlusion perception, revealing a performance gap between MLLMs and humans, and identifies three failure patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve MLLMs' occlusion perception, a critical but under-explored aspect of spatial understanding.

Method: Developed O-Bench using a layered synthesis approach on SA-1B, annotating 4,588 QA pairs across five tasks. Evaluated 22 MLLMs against human performance.

Result: Found a significant gap between MLLMs and humans, not bridged by scaling or reasoning. Identified three failure patterns.

Conclusion: O-Bench serves as a vital tool for evaluating and improving MLLMs' occlusion perception, inspiring better visual intelligence.

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

*Chengqian Dai,Yonghong Guo,Hongzhao Xiang,Yigui Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TNet introduces a Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network to enhance global-local feature interactions in remote sensing segmentation, outperforming benchmarks with efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks like UNet focus on intra-scale relationships but neglect global contextual dependencies across resolutions.

Method: TNet uses convolution and addition to progressively integrate low-resolution (global context) into high-resolution (local details) features.

Result: TNet-R achieves mIoU of 85.35% (Vaihingen), 87.05% (Potsdam), and 52.19% (LoveDA).

Conclusion: TNet effectively blends global and local information, offering competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods lack explicit 3D consistency or require implicit incorporation, limiting visual quality and coherence.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion models with 3D Gaussian splatting for explicit 3D consistency.

Result: Produces high-resolution, visually compelling results on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data while maintaining 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: 3DSR effectively enhances visual quality and 3D coherence without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

TL;DR: DET-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing depth and edge-aware regularization, enhancing geometric accuracy and visual fidelity in sparse-view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions due to non-local depth regularization and poor handling of semantic boundaries.

Method: DET-GS uses hierarchical geometric depth supervision, edge-aware regularization with semantic masks, and an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss.

Result: DET-GS outperforms SOTA methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity on sparse-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: DET-GS provides a robust solution for high-fidelity novel view synthesis by addressing depth noise and preserving scene boundaries.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

### [45] [NEARL-CLIP: Interacted Query Adaptation with Orthogonal Regularization for Medical Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04101)
*Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Yu Huang,Piao Yang,Feilong Tang,Zhengqin Xu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP is a novel framework for medical image analysis using VLMs, addressing domain gaps with cross-modality interaction and orthogonality techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated medical datasets and domain gaps hinder the direct use of VLMs like CLIP in medical imaging. Existing methods often misalign modalities.

Method: Proposes NEARL-CLIP with USEformer for dynamic cross-modality queries and OCA for orthogonality-based knowledge decoupling, adding only 1.46M parameters.

Result: Enhances modality interaction and knowledge enrichment, improving VLM performance in medical imaging.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP effectively bridges the domain gap and unlocks VLM potential for medical image analysis with minimal added parameters.

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

TL;DR: ARCADE is an AR-based platform designed to simplify human perception studies for CV model evaluation, offering cross-platform data collection, customizable protocols, and AR streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception studies are valuable but complex and hard to scale; AR presents a unique opportunity to streamline this process.

Method: Developed ARCADE, a platform supporting AR data collection, pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for user studies. Demonstrated with depth and lighting estimation models.

Result: ARCADE effectively elicits human perceptual judgments and shows usability and flexibility across deployment settings.

Conclusion: ARCADE is a flexible and effective tool for human-centered CV model evaluation, leveraging AR's advantages.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

*Jingchao Wang,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang,Yefeng Zheng,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg is a lightweight framework for Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) that leverages MLLM features without extra encoders, balancing performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between performance and cost in RES by avoiding heavy models like SAM while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses MLLM's visual encoder features, introduces a DSFF module for feature fusion, and a lightweight mask decoder (34M parameters).

Result: Outperforms SAM-based and SAM-free methods, achieving better performance-cost balance.

Conclusion: MLLMSeg is an efficient RES solution, leveraging MLLM features effectively without added complexity.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

*Likai Wang,Ruize Han,Xiangqun Zhang,Wei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLIPVehicle, a unified framework for joint vehicle detection and re-identification, addressing the conflict between detection and Re-ID objectives. It introduces a dual-granularity alignment module and multi-level learning strategy, validated on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vehicle search are resource-intensive and impractical, requiring separate detection and Re-ID steps. The paper aims to unify these tasks efficiently.

Method: CLIPVehicle uses a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module with VLMs and a multi-level learning strategy (global, instance, feature levels).

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art in vehicle Re-ID and person search, validated on CityFlowVS and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle effectively unifies detection and Re-ID, offering a practical solution for vehicle search with superior performance.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OC-DiT is a diffusion model for object-centric prediction, achieving zero-shot instance segmentation by conditioning on object templates and image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of disentangling object instances in instance segmentation without retraining on target data.

Method: Uses a conditional latent diffusion framework with two variants: a coarse model for initial proposals and a refinement model for parallel refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks without retraining.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

*Zheng Cheng,Wenri Wang,Guangyong Chen,Yakun Ju,Yihua Cheng,Zhisong Liu,Yanda Meng,Jintao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-scale feature extraction can outperform multi-scale methods in underwater image enhancement, leading to the proposed SSD-Net, which uses asymmetrical decomposition and combines CNN and Transformer strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-scale feature extraction methods are complex and may not be necessary for high-quality underwater image enhancement.

Method: Proposes SSD-Net with asymmetrical decomposition, combining CNN and Transformer via PFDB and BFCB modules for feature decoupling and fusion.

Result: Single-scale methods match or surpass multi-scale performance while reducing complexity.

Conclusion: SSD-Net effectively enhances underwater images by leveraging single-scale features and innovative decomposition mechanisms.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach combines privileged information and binary mask encoding to improve litter detection, achieving better accuracy and efficiency without added model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global rise in litter pollution by enhancing automated detection tools, particularly for small or obscured litter.

Method: Combines privileged information with deep learning object detection, encodes bounding box info as binary masks, and evaluates across five models on SODA, BDW, and UAVVaste datasets.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across models, better generalization, and maintained computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, scalable solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge to address cross-domain generalization in deception detection, leveraging multimodal data for adaptable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deception detection methods struggle with domain shifts and lack diverse samples, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The challenge evaluates models on cross-domain generalization using multimodal (audio, video, text) data.

Result: 21 teams participated, submitting final results for the challenge.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to advance adaptable, explainable deception detection systems and multimodal learning.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Mingbao Lin,Taojian Zhou,Guorong Cai,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS²Net introduces multi-view deep supervision for medical image segmentation, combining detail and semantic feature supervision with an adaptive uncertainty-based loss, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods supervise either coarse-grained semantic or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, ignoring their vital relationships in medical image analysis.

Method: DS²Net uses Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM) for multi-view supervision, along with an adaptive uncertainty-based loss.

Result: DS²Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmarks across colonoscopy, ultrasound, and microscope datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DS²Net successfully integrates multi-view deep supervision and adaptive loss, advancing medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFGVC is a training-free framework for few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that reformulates the task as multimodal retrieval, leveraging structured text descriptions and multimodal templates to improve generalization and avoid overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods relying on pre-trained models suffer from overfitting and weak generalization in few-shot FGVC. UniFGVC addresses this by integrating open-world knowledge from multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: UniFGVC uses a Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to generate structured text descriptions from images, forming multimodal templates. It then employs off-the-shelf encoders for retrieval in a joint vision-text space.

Result: UniFGVC outperforms prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and some fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches on 12 FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniFGVC provides a versatile, training-free solution for few-shot FGVC with strong generalization and adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net is a unified framework for generating RGB-D video sequences with precise camera control, combining RGB and depth synthesis in a geometry-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat RGB and depth generation separately, lacking spatial and geometric alignment. IDC-Net aims to unify these tasks for better camera control and geometric fidelity.

Method: IDC-Net uses a joint learning framework with a geometry-aware diffusion model and a camera-image-depth consistent dataset for training. It includes a geometry-aware transformer block for fine-grained camera control.

Result: IDC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and geometric consistency, enabling direct use in 3D scene reconstruction without post-processing.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework of IDC-Net improves RGB-D sequence generation, offering practical benefits for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM-Fusion combines meta-learning and in-context adaptation to enhance multi-task generalization in LoRA models, reducing conflicts and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods cause inter-weight conflicts and domain forgetting, especially in few-shot or long-tailed scenarios.

Method: Proposes ICM-Fusion with task vector arithmetic and Fusion VAE to dynamically balance and reconstruct fused LoRA weights.

Result: ICM-Fusion reduces multi-tasking loss and enhances performance in few-shot scenarios across visual and linguistic tasks.

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion is adaptable, effective, and outperforms current LoRA fusion methods.

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAVN is a network for restoring degraded face videos using audio and visual correlations, outperforming existing methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face videos often suffer from degradations, and existing methods overlook visual-audio correlations, especially in mouth regions. GAVN aims to address this gap.

Method: GAVN uses identity and temporal complementary learning: it captures temporal features in low-resolution space, extracts identity features with audio and landmarks in high-resolution space, and integrates both for reconstruction.

Result: GAVN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.

Conclusion: GAVN effectively restores face videos by leveraging audio-visual correlations and achieves superior performance across multiple degradation types.

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of 6,300 real-world memes annotated for toxicity and proposes a tag generation module to enhance meme moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of accessible data and high costs in meme moderation, exacerbated by social media's role in spreading harmful content.

Method: Created a two-stage annotated dataset (toxic/normal and fine-grained labels) and a tag generation module for context enrichment.

Result: Incorporating socially grounded tags improves performance of state-of-the-art VLMs in detection tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable foundation for better content moderation in multimodal online spaces.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Motivation: Existing GRPO-based methods for anomaly detection in MLLMs lack efficient training data utilization and structured supervision, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework introduces a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process and a fine-grained reward mechanism to enhance model performance.

Result: The method shows significant improvements in accuracy and adaptability for anomaly detection across industrial datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between general MLLM capabilities and specialized anomaly detection needs.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

*Jin Kuang,Dong Liu,Yukuang Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U2CLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal correlation modeling to address feature uncertainty and noise dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook intrinsic uncertainty in feature representations under dark conditions, leading to degraded gradients and noise dominance, impairing reliability and causal reasoning.

Method: Proposes U2CLLIE with two key components: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module for noise suppression and feature optimization, and (2) a hierarchical causality-aware framework with Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) and causal correlation modules (NeCo and AsC).

Result: U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, showing robustness and generalization across scenes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates gradient vanishing and noise dominance, enhancing low-light image quality through uncertainty-aware and causality-aware modeling.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

TL;DR: The paper explores the practical utility and training stability of the ViT-22B model in a local environment, compares its performance to ViT, and investigates its potential for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete understanding of the practical utility of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B and explore their capabilities beyond traditional tasks.

Method: Examines ViT-22B's training behavior in a local environment, modifies the model for stability, and proposes an image generation architecture using ViT and ViT-22B.

Result: ViT-22B outperforms ViT under the same parameter size and shows potential for image generation, though training instability was noted.

Conclusion: ViT-22B is a promising structure for vision tasks, including image generation, but requires modifications for stable training.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

*Fengyi Wu,Yimian Dai,Tianfang Zhang,Yixuan Ding,Jian Yang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ combines RPCA's interpretability with deep learning efficiency for sparse object segmentation, addressing traditional RPCA limitations like computational burden and rigid priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RPCA models are computationally heavy, rely on hyperparameters, and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: RPCANet++ unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a network with Background Approximation, Object Extraction, and Image Restoration Modules, enhanced by Memory-Augmented and Deep Contrast Prior Modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets, with improved interpretability via low-rankness and sparsity measurements.

Conclusion: RPCANet++ sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation by merging RPCA's strengths with deep learning efficiency.

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

### [63] [From Learning to Unlearning: Biomedical Security Protection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04192)
*Dunyuan Xu,Xikai Yang,Yaoqian Li,Jinpeng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLMU-Med, the first benchmark for evaluating unlearning in biomedical MLLMs, addressing privacy and incorrect knowledge removal. It highlights limited effectiveness of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical MLLMs risk privacy leaks and incorrect outputs due to undetected harmful training data. Retraining is impractical, so unlearning is proposed as a solution.

Method: Developed MLLMU-Med, a benchmark with synthetic private data and factual errors, and introduced an Unlearning Efficiency Score to evaluate performance.

Result: Current unlearning methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge from biomedical MLLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for future research in improving unlearning techniques for biomedical MLLMs.

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAT (Gather and Trace) is a novel model for Video TextVQA that improves accuracy and efficiency by focusing on instance-oriented text reading and dynamic evolution tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frame-level frameworks suffer from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: GAT uses a context-aggregated instance gathering module for unified textual representation and an instance-focused trajectory tracing module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: GAT outperforms existing methods by 3.86% in accuracy and is ten times faster than video large language models.

Conclusion: GAT is effective and generalizes well, setting a new state-of-the-art for Video TextVQA.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BootSC is a deep spectral clustering model that integrates all stages of spectral clustering into a single end-to-end network, addressing disjoint optimization and limited representation capacity. It uses optimal-transport-derived supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the disjoint optimization process and limited representation capacity in traditional spectral clustering.

Method: Jointly learns affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and k-means clustering in an end-to-end network, using optimal-transport-derived supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., a 16% NMI improvement on ImageNet-Dogs.

Conclusion: BootSC effectively integrates and optimizes spectral clustering stages, significantly enhancing clustering performance.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

*Ben Zhang,LuLu Yu,Lei Gao,Jing Liu,QuanJiang Guo,Hui Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViFP is a framework to improve visual-language model reasoning by detecting false positives (FPs) and enhancing reasoning reliability through sub-question templates and multi-turn QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of false positive reasoning in VLMs, where correct answers stem from incorrect reasoning paths, and overcoming dataset dependency and poor generalization in existing methods.

Method: ViFP constructs sub-question templates for visual reasoning dimensions, uses multi-turn QA for accurate reasoning paths, and dynamically analyzes reasoning consistency to detect FPs. It also employs a targeted CoT mechanism.

Result: ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4% on A-OKVQA, reduces FPs, and outperforms previous methods by 4.3%.

Conclusion: ViFP enhances reasoning reliability in VLMs by addressing FP issues and improving accuracy, validated by the new VoC metric.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

TL;DR: Proposes MMCAF-Net, a multimodal deep learning model for medical diagnosis, addressing challenges in aligning imaging and EHR data with cross-attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy by overcoming dimensionality mismatches between medical imaging and EHR data.

Method: Uses a feature pyramid and 3D multi-scale convolutional attention for lesion feature extraction, plus a cross-attention module for multimodal fusion.

Result: Achieves superior diagnostic accuracy on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net effectively integrates multimodal data, enhancing medical disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation models, proposing oracle components to improve performance by leveraging groundtruth information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary models fail to recognize concepts outside training taxonomy, with performance stagnating for years.

Method: Introduces novel oracle components to identify and decouple bottlenecks using groundtruth data.

Result: Validation experiments reveal insights into model failures and suggest future research directions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a pathway to unlock advancements in open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitGaussian decouples static and dynamic scene components in 3D reconstruction from monocular video, improving quality and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods entangle static and dynamic elements, causing artifacts like motion leakage and flickering.

Method: Proposes SplitGaussian, a framework that explicitly separates static and dynamic components, decoupling motion modeling from background geometry.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion separation.

Conclusion: Disentangled design enhances temporal consistency, fidelity, and convergence speed.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of VLMs to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings, which degrades cross-modal alignment and generalization.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of solutions: multi-modal replay strategies, cross-modal regularization, and parameter-efficient adaptation. Analyzes evaluation protocols and benchmarks.

Result: Identifies core failure modes in VLM-CL and maps solutions to these challenges, highlighting gaps in current benchmarks.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a diagnostic reference for lifelong VLM development, with open problems like continual pre-training and zero-shot learning needing further research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V introduces a layered approach for Text-to-Video generation, enabling coherent multi-object motion control by compositing background and foreground objects separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with multi-object motion, especially when trajectories intersect, due to semantic conflicts in colliding regions.

Method: LayerT2V generates videos by layering background and foreground objects, allowing independent control and integration of multiple elements.

Result: LayerT2V outperforms SOTA methods with 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics for multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: LayerT2V effectively addresses multi-object motion challenges in T2V generation, offering superior performance and control.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates motion intentions, improving interpretability and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles but is challenging due to human motion's multimodal and uncertain nature. Existing diffusion models lack explicit motion intention integration.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-based model with motion intention recognition (lateral/longitudinal components) and an efficient guidance mechanism for interpretable trajectories.

Result: Evaluated on ETH and UCY benchmarks, the model achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion intentions enhances interpretability and precision in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving transparency and reliability of black-box AI systems in document processing, especially to avoid biases and spurious correlations in high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes DocVCE, leveraging latent diffusion models and classifier guidance to generate visual counterfactual explanations, followed by hierarchical patch-wise refinement.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on three datasets (RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, DocLayNet) and three models (ResNet, ConvNeXt, DiT) using validity, closeness, and realism metrics.

Conclusion: First work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis, providing actionable insights into model decisions.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Conclusion: CNNs are effective for SAR-based classification, with antenna height impacting success.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to
classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

### [75] [PIS3R: Very Large Parallax Image Stitching via Deep 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04236)
*Muhua Zhu,Xinhao Jin,Chengbo Wang,Yongcong Zhang,Yifei Xue,Tie Ji,Yizhen Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIS3R is a novel image stitching method using deep 3D reconstruction to handle large parallax, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stitching methods struggle with large parallax due to depth variations and significant camera baselines.

Method: Uses a transformer for 3D scene reconstruction, reprojects point clouds for alignment, and refines results with a diffusion module.

Result: Accurate stitching for large parallax, preserving geometric integrity and outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PIS3R is robust for large parallax and suitable for downstream 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Method: Integration of computer vision, ethology, and neuroscience with AI and machine learning techniques.

Result: Provides multifaceted insights into rodent social behavior but identifies challenges in AI integration.

Conclusion: Offers practical solutions for researchers and encourages further discussion on evolving tool requirements in social neuroscience.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from

benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses
several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools
available for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and
limitations. Additionally, we suggest practical solutions to address common
hurdles, aiming to guide young researchers in adopting these methods and to

*Xiao Wang,Ziwen Wang,Wentao Wu,Anjie Wang,Jiashu Wu,Yantao Pan,Chenglong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAV, a framework for vehicle part segmentation, addressing limitations of SAM by incorporating a knowledge graph and context retrieval. It also releases a new dataset, VehicleSeg10K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large segmentation models like SAM lack fine-grained capabilities for vehicle part segmentation due to missing semantic labels and inaccessible text-prompted functionality.

Method: SAV combines a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context retrieval module to enhance segmentation with structural and contextual priors.

Result: The framework is tested on VehicleSeg10K and other datasets, showing improved performance and generalization.

Conclusion: SAV advances vehicle part segmentation by integrating structured knowledge and contextual learning, supported by a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %
Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon
acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT) in Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) suffers from severe forgetting, showing PVMs retain knowledge well. It proposes DFT*, a simple enhancement to DFT, outperforming complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the assumption that DFT in CSS is highly prone to catastrophic forgetting and to explore the actual anti-forgetting capabilities of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs).

Method: Systematically revisits forgetting in DFT across benchmarks (Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K) using ResNet101 and Swin-B backbones. Proposes DFT*, which freezes the PVM backbone, pre-allocates classifiers, and retains learned classifiers.

Result: PVMs under DFT retain knowledge with minimal forgetting. DFT* outperforms 16 state-of-the-art CSS methods with fewer parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that PVMs inherently resist forgetting in CSS, and DFT* offers a simple yet highly effective solution, challenging the need for complex mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

*Chenlei Lv,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PKSS-Align is a robust point cloud registration method handling similarity transformations, noise, and defects without training or complex encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sensitivity to transformations, noise, and incomplete structures in point cloud registration.

Method: Uses Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS) for shape feature-based similarity, avoiding point-to-point metrics.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align is practical, efficient, and effective for diverse point cloud registration challenges.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of novel view synthesis with varying baseline settings, including sparse and diverse input views.

Method: Integrates MVS and MDE features, employs a projection-and-sampling mechanism for depth fusion, and uses 3D Gaussian representations for efficiency.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on DTU, RealEstate10K, and promising zero-shot results on LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360.

Conclusion: MuRF effectively generalizes across diverse baseline settings and scenarios, improving rendering quality and efficiency.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple
objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also
demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360
datasets.

*Yifan Wang,Ziyi Liu,Xiaolong Sun,Jiawei Wang,Hongmin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LATR, a Length-Aware Transformer for Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), which improves performance by assigning queries to handle segments of varying temporal lengths and suppressing mismatched predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of explicit supervision in DETR-based models causes learned queries to overlap, leading to redundant predictions in TSG tasks.

Method: LATR divides queries into three groups (short, middle, long durations) and introduces a length classification task to suppress mismatched predictions, ensuring each query specializes in its role.

Result: LATR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating length priors into TSG tasks is critical, and LATR's design effectively addresses query redundancy, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAEPD, a foundational model for DAS signal recognition using a Masked Autoencoder, pretrained on diverse datasets. It employs Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for efficient downstream tasks, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data distribution disparities and limited labeled training data in DAS applications to improve cross-domain generalization.

Method: Pretraining a Masked Autoencoder (MAEPD) on diverse DAS signals, followed by Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for downstream tasks, freezing most parameters and fine-tuning only small prompt vectors.

Result: MAEPD achieves 96.94% accuracy in gait recognition, outperforming Full Fine Tuning by 0.61% with 45% faster training. It also performs well in pipeline leakage detection.

Conclusion: MAEPD offers an efficient, scalable, and generalizable solution for DAS signal recognition, addressing domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempFlow-GRPO improves flow matching models by addressing temporal uniformity in reward assignment, enhancing human preference alignment in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching models struggle with fine-grained reward optimization due to uniform credit assignment, limiting their alignment with human preferences.

Method: Introduces TempFlow-GRPO with trajectory branching for process rewards and noise-aware weighting for optimized policy learning across timesteps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO effectively addresses temporal uniformity, improving exploration and convergence in flow-based generation.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiemanLine is a minimal 3D line representation on Riemannian manifolds, accommodating both individual lines and parallel-line groups, improving accuracy and reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line representations ignore structural regularities like parallel lines common in man-made environments, limiting efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Decouples lines into global (vanishing direction on S²) and local (scaled normal vectors) components, reducing parameter space and embedding parallelism naturally.

Result: Achieves more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, reduces parameter dimensionality, and improves convergence stability.

Conclusion: RiemanLine offers a unified, efficient representation for 3D lines, enhancing performance in camera localization and structural mapping.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotatedMVPS improves shape and reflectance recovery under natural light using a rotation stage and integrates learning-based priors for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPS methods require controlled settings or neglect reflectance and illumination recovery, limiting their use in natural scenarios.

Method: RotatedMVPS uses a rotation stage for light consistency and integrates learning-based single-view priors into MVPS.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show improved accuracy in shape and reflectance recovery.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS enhances MVPS applicability in natural illumination and inverse rendering tasks.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPO improves MLLMs' long-video understanding via reinforcement learning for event-aware keyframe selection and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with long videos due to context limits and training costs, leading to suboptimal sparse frame sampling.

Method: Proposes TSPO, using reinforcement learning for event-aware keyframe selection and joint optimization with rule-based rewards.

Result: TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-video benchmarks and shows transferability across Video-MLLMs.

Conclusion: TSPO effectively addresses long-video challenges in MLLMs, enhancing understanding and transferability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in cross-modal transfer from vision to time series, including data-modality, multivariate-forecasting, and probabilistic-forecasting gaps.

Method: Proposes VisionTS++ with three innovations: vision-model-based filtering, colorized multivariate conversion, and multi-quantile forecasting.

Result: Achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized models by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9/12 probabilistic forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing universal time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoN, a few-shot learning framework, uses a graph-based approach with a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) to improve ear biometric recognition by jointly processing multiple impressions of an identity, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ear biometrics face challenges like scarce annotated data and intra-class variability. Existing methods fail to capture consistent identity features from isolated impressions.

Method: ProtoN employs a graph-based approach with PGNN, refining impression and prototype representations via dual-path message-passing and cross-graph prototype alignment. A hybrid loss function balances episodic and global classification.

Result: ProtoN achieves 99.60% Rank-1 accuracy and 0.025 EER on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ProtoN effectively addresses data scarcity and variability in ear biometrics, demonstrating superior performance for few-shot recognition.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited

*Yinan Yu,Alex Gonzalez-Caceres,Samuel Scheidegger,Sanjay Somanath,Alexander Hollberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SI3FP is a pipeline for generating LoD3 thermal models from images using computer vision and deep learning, addressing challenges in scalable feature identification for building renovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-phase renovation planning requires accurate thermal 3D models (LoD3), but scalable feature identification (e.g., windows) is challenging.

Method: SI3FP extracts geometries from images using computer vision and deep learning, directly modeling geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane to reduce distortions.

Result: Tested on Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved ~5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, suitable for early-stage renovation analysis.

Conclusion: SI3FP enables scalable energy renovation planning and has broader urban development applications.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

*Haoji Zhang,Xin Gu,Jiawen Li,Chixiang Ma,Sule Bai,Chubin Zhang,Bowen Zhang,Zhichao Zhou,Dongliang He,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITAL is a tool-augmented learning framework for MLLMs, enhancing video reasoning with multimodal CoT and addressing challenges like cross-modal interaction and hallucination. It outperforms existing methods in video QA and temporal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based CoT reasoning in MLLMs lacks cross-modal interaction and suffers from hallucination, especially in long videos. VITAL aims to improve this with tool-augmented learning.

Method: Proposes VITAL, an end-to-end agentic framework with a visual toolbox for dense frame sampling and multimodal CoT. Introduces datasets MTVR-CoT-72k and MTVR-RL-110k, and the DGRPO algorithm for multi-task RL.

Result: VITAL outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, excelling in long video scenarios for QA and temporal grounding.

Conclusion: VITAL advances video reasoning in MLLMs, demonstrating superior performance and providing publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

*Christian Bohn,Thomas Kurbiel,Klaus Friedrichs,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention for efficient multitask learning, reducing FLOPs and latency while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' Multi-Head-Attention is computationally expensive for multitask learning due to quadratic scaling with task numbers.

Method: Introduces Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention to efficiently aggregate information across tasks.

Result: Achieves order-of-magnitude reductions in FLOPs and latency, with up to 7.4% improvement in task metrics.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and efficient solution for multitask learning with Transformers.

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

*Tong Wang,Guanyu Yang,Nian Liu,Zongyan Han,Jinxing Zhou,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a new task for object-level retrieval and segmentation using composed expressions, and presents CORE, a model outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods lack object-level precision, limiting their ability to localize specific objects. COR addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes COR127K benchmark and CORE model, which integrates reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning.

Result: CORE outperforms existing models in base and novel categories, setting a strong baseline for COR.

Conclusion: COR advances fine-grained multi-modal retrieval, with CORE providing an effective solution and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

*Jonas Ammeling,Jonathan Ganz,Emely Rosbach,Ludwig Lausser,Christof A. Bertram,Katharina Breininger,Marc Aubreville*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models, adapted with LoRA, outperform linear probing and nearly match full-data performance with only 10% training data, while also improving robustness to unseen tumor domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data in pathology hampers deep learning performance. Self-supervised foundation models can mitigate this by leveraging unlabeled data for robust feature extraction.

Method: Investigated data scaling laws and robustness of foundation models for mitotic figure classification, comparing LoRA-adapted models, linear probing, and end-to-end-trained CNNs/Vision Transformers.

Result: LoRA-adapted models achieve near-full-data performance with 10% training data and reduce out-of-domain performance gaps. Traditional fine-tuning remains competitive.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted foundation models offer a promising solution for limited-data scenarios in pathology, balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

*Qingguo Hu,Ante Wang,Jia Song,Delai Qiu,Qingsong Liu,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-improvement framework (CVC) to enhance LVLMs' visual perception by inferring masked objects using causal relationships, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs lack deep visual perception due to limited visual knowledge in training data, hindering tasks like identifying subtle image differences.

Method: Proposes CVC, a visual knowledge-intensive task, using automated instance construction for self-improvement via trial and error learning.

Result: Substantial improvements on specialized tasks (5.4% and 4.0% gains with LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively) and comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CVC framework effectively enhances LVLMs' visual perception and reasoning, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaoyu Li,Yaowei Li,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DVD is a cascaded video diffusion model that decouples 4D content generation into layout prediction and structure-aware generation, achieving high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly generating high-dimensional data like 4D is complex; 4DVD simplifies this by decoupling the process.

Method: 4DVD first predicts dense view content layout, then uses structure-aware spatio-temporal generation to refine the output.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Conclusion: 4DVD enables accurate 4D representation and has practical applications, demonstrated by experiments on the D-Objaverse dataset.

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrEVL explores frozen pretrained embeddings for efficient vision-language tasks, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of vision-language models by leveraging frozen embeddings for efficiency.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained embeddings and evaluates their effectiveness on discriminative tasks, measuring performance, speed, and energy consumption.

Result: Achieves 85-95% of SOTA performance with 68.4M parameters, 2.3x speedup, and 52% lower energy use.

Conclusion: Frozen embeddings are viable when pretraining aligns with task needs, offering efficiency gains with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

### [97] [Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04472)
*Hongxu Chen,Zhen Wang,Taoran Mei,Lin Li,Bowei Zhu,Runshi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ErasePro improves concept erasure in text-to-image models by enforcing zero-residual alignment and using progressive layer-wise updates, addressing incomplete erasure and quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concept erasure in text-to-image models suffer from incomplete erasure due to non-zero alignment residuals and quality degradation from concentrated parameter updates in deep layers.

Method: ErasePro introduces a zero-residual constraint for perfect alignment and employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy to transfer target concept features gradually.

Result: Empirical results show ErasePro's effectiveness in tasks like instance, art style, and nudity erasure, achieving more complete erasure and better generative quality.

Conclusion: ErasePro offers a robust solution for concept erasure, balancing completeness and generative quality through its novel optimization approach.

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

*Bowen Chai,Zheng Chen,Libo Zhu,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVSR introduces a low-bit quantization model for video super-resolution (VSR) using spatio-temporal complexity awareness and learnable bias alignment to maintain performance while reducing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for VSR are resource-intensive and slow, limiting practical use. Quantization can help but is challenging due to temporal characteristics and fidelity needs.

Method: Proposes STCA mechanism to measure spatial/temporal complexities and allocate layer-specific ranks. Uses LBA module to reduce quantization errors. Jointly refines FP and low-bit branches.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to full-precision models and outperforms other low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: QuantVSR effectively balances performance and efficiency, making VSR models more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

*Panagiotis Alimisis,Christos Diou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Delta Embeddings for representing interventions in causal representation learning, improving OOD robustness without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on scene variables under causal models, but neglects intervention representations. Addressing this gap can enhance model generalization and robustness.

Method: Proposes Causal Delta Embeddings, which are invariant to visual scenes and sparse in affecting causal variables. A framework learns these from image pairs without supervision.

Result: Experiments show Causal Delta Embeddings outperform baselines in OOD settings on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focusing on intervention representations via Causal Delta Embeddings significantly improves OOD robustness in causal representation learning.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

TL;DR: MonoCloth reconstructs and animates clothed human avatars from monocular videos using part-based decomposition and a dedicated cloth simulation module, improving quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited geometric information and complex non-rigid motion in monocular videos make 3D human avatar reconstruction challenging.

Method: Part-based decomposition separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing, with detailed geometry recovery for face/hands and a cloth simulation module for garments.

Result: MonoCloth outperforms existing methods in visual reconstruction quality and animation realism, and supports clothing transfer.

Conclusion: MonoCloth's part-based design enhances versatility and practical utility for 3D avatar reconstruction and animation.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for skeleton-based temporal action segmentation using a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder and motion word quantization, outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods focus on video data, neglecting skeleton sequences despite their practical advantages like robustness and privacy.

Method: Uses a temporal autoencoder to disentangle joint information, divides latent sequences into patches, and quantizes them into motion words for action clustering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in unsupervised skeleton-based action segmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAIDX is a new deepfake detection framework combining RAG and GRPO for better accuracy and explainability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors lack transparency and rely on labor-intensive annotations, prompting the need for a more accurate and explainable solution.

Method: RAIDX integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved detection and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained explanations.

Result: RAIDX achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection and provides interpretable textual and visual explanations.

Conclusion: RAIDX successfully addresses gaps in accuracy and explainability, setting a new standard for deepfake detection frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Result: Achieves improved segmentation accuracy on medical datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg, and Kvasir-SEG.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key
element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer
vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these
methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models
specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive
processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores,
enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in
standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods often neglect critical information in teacher logit distributions, particularly Top-K knowledge, which this paper aims to exploit.

Method: TopKD includes a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) to amplify informative logits and a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL) for targeted supervision, integrating seamlessly with existing methods.

Result: TopKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods on datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and works well with Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the untapped potential of logits in knowledge distillation, demonstrating TopKD's effectiveness and versatility across architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

*Safwen Naimi,Arij Said,Wassim Bouachir,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InceptoFormer is a neural framework combining Inception1D and Transformer for Parkinson's Disease severity evaluation via gait analysis, achieving 96.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PD severity assessment by capturing multi-scale temporal features and addressing class imbalance.

Method: Uses Inception1D for multi-scale feature extraction and Transformer for long-range dependencies, with oversampling for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves 96.6% accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer effectively evaluates PD severity, offering a robust solution for gait dynamics analysis.

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

### [106] [Hierarchical Event Memory for Accurate and Low-latency Online Video Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04546)
*Minghang Zheng,Yuxin Peng,Benyuan Sun,Yi Yang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical event memory framework for online video temporal grounding (OnVTG) to improve event modeling and retain long-term historical information, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OnVTG models lack effective event modeling and long-term historical information retention, leading to low performance.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical event memory for event-level modeling and a future prediction branch for real-time event forecasting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current OnVTG models by enhancing event modeling and historical information retention.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

TL;DR: A two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline is proposed to address challenges in marine video understanding, leveraging video, text, and segmentation masks for improved analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning datasets fail to generalize to marine environments, limiting insights into marine life.

Method: A two-stage pipeline using video, text, and segmentation masks, with video splitting for detecting salient object transitions.

Result: Improved marine video understanding, analysis, and generation, enriched captioning semantics.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset advance marine video captioning and understanding.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TWGTM, a unified framework for joint virtual try-on (VTON) and virtual try-off (VTOFF) tasks, addressing their complementary symmetry through bidirectional feature disentanglement and phased training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works treat VTON and VTOFF as isolated tasks, neglecting their complementary symmetry. This gap hinders systematic investigation and unified solutions.

Method: Proposes TWGTM, a unified framework using dual-conditioned guidance from latent and pixel spaces, and a phased training paradigm to bridge modality gaps.

Result: Validated on DressCode and VITON-HD datasets, TWGTM shows efficacy and competitive performance in both tasks.

Conclusion: TWGTM successfully unifies VTON and VTOFF, offering a bidirectional solution with practical applications in garment-centric image synthesis.

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

*Franz Thaler,Darko Stern,Gernot Plank,Martin Urschler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for whole heart segmentation using CT and MR data to address domain shift challenges, achieving high accuracy for patient-specific cardiac models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death, necessitating advanced methods for analyzing cardiac structures from medical images to improve diagnosis and personalized therapy.

Method: The approach includes balanced joint training using CT and MR data, strong intensity and spatial augmentation, and a 5-fold ensemble model.

Result: The method achieved 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT, and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, outperforming or matching domain-specific models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses domain shift and provides accurate segmentations for generating patient-specific cardiac digital twin models.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

*Jinxi Liu,Zijian He,Guangrun Wang,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMFA is a unified diffusion framework for virtual try-on and try-off, eliminating the need for exhibition garments and supporting arbitrary poses. It uses partial diffusion for dynamic control and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, limiting flexibility in pose variations and real-world practicality. OMFA aims to overcome these constraints.

Method: OMFA employs a partial diffusion strategy, selectively applying noise and denoising to components like garments or faces, enabling bidirectional transformations. It uses SMPL-X-based pose conditioning for multi-view and arbitrary-pose support.

Result: OMFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in try-on and try-off tasks, operating without masks and requiring only a single portrait and target pose.

Conclusion: OMFA provides a practical, generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis, advancing realism and usability in virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

TL;DR: Event-based vision offers a robust solution for detecting drones, overcoming limitations of traditional cameras like motion blur and poor lighting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveillance systems fail to reliably detect small, agile drones due to motion blur and lighting challenges.

Method: Survey of event-based vision, including data representation, spiking neural networks, and advanced tasks like tracking and identification.

Result: Event cameras eliminate motion blur, enable consistent detection in extreme lighting, and support low-latency processing.

Conclusion: Event-based vision is a powerful foundation for next-gen counter-UAV systems, offering reliability, low latency, and efficiency.

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

*Yunbi Liu,Enqi Tang,Shiyu Li,Lei Ma,Juncheng Li,Shu Lou,Yongchu Pan,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAlignDiff introduces a diffusion-based method for tooth alignment, combining point cloud regression and diffusion modeling to improve orthodontic treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for tooth alignment rely on deterministic geometric constraints, missing the anatomical distribution of transformation matrices.

Method: TAlignDiff uses a point cloud-based regression network (PRN) for alignment and a diffusion-based denoising module (DTMD) to learn transformation matrix distributions.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches, showing effectiveness in tooth alignment for orthodontic treatment.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff's unified framework enhances alignment accuracy by integrating geometric constraints and diffusion refinement.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces W-DAVEL, a weakly-supervised task for dense audio-visual event localization, using cross-modal salient anchors and agreement scores to improve localization without temporal labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing events in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels, leveraging cross-modal consistency for better performance.

Method: Proposes a Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation module for agreement scores, Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification for anchor features, and Anchor-based Temporal Propagation for enhanced localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization by exploiting cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to training bias, introduces the POPEv2 benchmark, and proposes Obliviate, an unlearning method to mitigate hallucination by updating the LM head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LVLMs, where generated text contradicts visual input, is linked to training bias, prompting a systematic study of training data's role.

Method: Introduces POPEv2 benchmark with counterfactual images, probes model components, and proposes Obliviate, a lightweight unlearning method targeting the LM head.

Result: LVLMs exhibit training bias, performing poorly on counterfactual images. Obliviate reduces hallucination efficiently, updating only 2% of parameters.

Conclusion: Obliviate effectively mitigates hallucination, scales well with model size and data volume, and generalizes beyond object-level hallucination.

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tractography by capturing both local structural details and global dependencies in streamline propagation.

Method: Uses a dual-pathway encoding network for local and global modeling, combined with a conditional diffusion model for end-to-end training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (ISMRM Challenge, TractoInferno) and shows strong generalizability across datasets.

Conclusion: DDTracking provides anatomically plausible, robust, and scalable tractography for diverse dMRI applications.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K2Sight improves medical image grounding by decomposing clinical concepts into visual attributes, enabling efficient training of compact models with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist VLMs struggle in medical grounding due to domain-specific terms, while specialized VLMs require extensive resources. K2Sight addresses this gap.

Method: K2Sight uses structured semantic supervision, decomposing clinical concepts into visual attributes (e.g., shape, density) and encoding them into prompts for training.

Result: Compact models (0.23B and 2B parameters) trained with 1.5% of data match or outperform 7B+ medical VLMs, with up to 9.82% mAP50 improvement.

Conclusion: K2Sight efficiently bridges domain knowledge and spatial structure, enabling high performance with minimal data and model size.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for skin disease classification evaluates pre-processing techniques and model architectures, finding DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing most effective (93% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin disease classification is challenging due to inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, requiring robust CAD systems.

Method: Evaluated RGB, CMY, and CLAHE pre-processing with CNN and transformer models (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5, ViT, Swin, DinoV2).

Result: DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieved the highest accuracy (93%) and F1-scores, with Grad-CAM showing precise lesion localization.

Conclusion: Effective pre-processing and model choice are crucial for robust and explainable dermatological CAD systems.

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

various real-world applications. Among them, audio-visual systems are among the
most widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and
voice of a person has gained attention due to the presence of unique
correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual
Environments (FAME) 2026 Challenge focuses on exploring face-voice association
under the unique condition of a multilingual scenario. This condition is
inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and
most often people communicate under multilingual scenarios. The challenge uses
a dataset named Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice
association in multilingual environments. This report provides the details of
the challenge, dataset, baseline models, and task details for the FAME
Challenge.

### [119] [Pseudo Depth Meets Gaussian: A Feed-forward RGB SLAM Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04597)
*Linqing Zhao,Xiuwei Xu,Yirui Wang,Hao Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yansong Tang,Haibin Yan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM and feed-forward pose prediction, improving speed and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in real-sized 3D geometry recovery from pose-free RGB streams, avoiding slow optimization and depth sensor dependency.

Method: Integrates 3D Gaussian mapping with SLAM, uses feed-forward recurrent prediction for camera pose, and employs local graph rendering for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (comparable to SplaTAM) with 90% faster tracking on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers a fast, robust solution for online 3D reconstruction without depth sensors or slow optimization.

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

*Tongfan Guan,Jiaxin Guo,Chen Wang,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniDepth unifies monocular and stereo depth estimation by iteratively aligning their latent representations, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular and stereo depth estimation have complementary strengths but remain disjoint in practice. OmniDepth aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses iterative bidirectional alignment and a cross-attentive mechanism to synchronize monocular contextual cues with stereo representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing zero-shot generalization error by >40% on benchmarks like Middlebury and ETH3D.

Conclusion: OmniDepth harmonizes multi-view geometry with monocular context, overcoming modality-specific limitations for robust 3D perception.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Kagan Ozturk,Deeksha Arun,Kevin W. Bowyer,Patrick Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of bilateral ear symmetry on CNN-based ear recognition, showing that treating left and right ears separately improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite CNNs' success in ear recognition, the influence of bilateral ear symmetry on learned features is understudied.

Method: Developed an ear side classifier, incorporated side information in training/testing, and conducted cross-dataset evaluations on five datasets.

Result: Separate treatment of left and right ears during training/testing yields notable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Practical insights for training CNN-based ear recognition systems are provided, emphasizing the importance of bilateral symmetry.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:

that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EncQA benchmark evaluates VLMs on chart understanding, revealing performance gaps across visual encodings and tasks, suggesting targeted improvements over scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs' progress on chart understanding benchmarks doesn't fully address essential visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces EncQA, a benchmark with 2,076 synthetic QA pairs covering 6 visual encodings and 8 tasks, evaluated on 9 VLMs.

Result: Performance varies across encodings and tasks, with no improvement from model scaling for many cases.

Conclusion: Targeted strategies for specific visual reasoning gaps are needed, not just scaling models or datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-SAM is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that enhances pixel-level perceptual understanding, unifying segmentation tasks and introducing Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation for interactive prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in pixel-level perception and SAM's shortcomings in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation.

Method: Proposes X-SAM, a unified MLLM framework with VGD segmentation and a co-training strategy for diverse datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: X-SAM advances multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A
sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides
accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to

*Gustav Hanning,Kalle Åström,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCuboid is an optimization-based method for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation using multi-view alignment of dense deep features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on single views and panoramic images, limiting accuracy and flexibility. PixCuboid addresses this by leveraging multi-view alignment.

Method: Uses optimization-based multi-view alignment of dense deep features, trained end-to-end to improve convergence and loss landscapes. Simple heuristics initialize the layout.

Result: Outperforms competitors on new benchmarks (ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics) with verified ground truth. Extends to multi-room estimation despite single-cuboid training.

Conclusion: PixCuboid offers a flexible, high-performance solution for room layout estimation, with potential for broader applications like multi-room scenarios.

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

*Young D. Kwon,Rui Li,Sijia Li,Da Li,Sourav Bhattacharya,Stylianos I. Venieris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune is a compression framework for text-to-image diffusion models, reducing memory and latency while preserving output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale diffusion models (8-11B parameters) are resource-intensive, making on-device inference challenging.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Position Pruning, Positional Weight Preservation, and Sensitivity-Guided Distillation to compress models.

Result: Achieves 77.5-80.4% memory reduction, 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, with minimal quality drop (2.6% GenEval, 7% HPSv2).

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune enables efficient on-device inference while maintaining perceptual quality, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

*Yansheng Gao,Yufei Zheng,Jinghan Qu,Zixi Zhu,Yukuan Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt is a prompt tuning framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that enhances robustness against weak semantic perturbations by integrating noise prompts and noise-resistant visual prototypes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to subtle noise, degrading their generalization to unseen classes.

Method: ANPrompt constructs noise prompts from perturbed text embeddings, integrates them with learnable tokens, and computes a Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP). It uses alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives.

Result: ANPrompt outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, showing superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: ANPrompt effectively addresses the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs to weak semantic noise, improving robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality, which are crucial for AI assistants to perceive and act effectively.

Method: A hybrid RGB-MoCap system is used to capture interactions, with assistants following GPT-generated scripts in a vision-language-action framework.

Result: InterVLA includes 11.4 hours of multimodal data (1.2M frames) across 7 videos, with benchmarks for motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and prediction.

Conclusion: InterVLA and its benchmarks will support future research in developing AI agents for the physical world.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Motivation: Training multi-agent systems is challenging and requires extensive manual design. TurboTrain aims to streamline this process.

Method: TurboTrain uses masked reconstruction learning for pretraining and gradient conflict suppression for balanced multi-task learning.

Result: Evaluated on V2XPnP-Seq, TurboTrain improves state-of-the-art multi-agent perception and prediction models.

Conclusion: Pretraining captures spatiotemporal features effectively, and balanced learning enhances detection and prediction.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced

TL;DR: BEVCon is a contrastive learning framework for improving BEV perception in autonomous driving, enhancing feature representations in BEV encoders and image backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV perception is vital for autonomous driving tasks, but representation learning in BEV models is underexplored.

Method: BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: instance feature contrast for BEV features and perspective view contrast for the image backbone.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show up to +2.4% mAP improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: Representation learning is crucial for BEV perception and complements task-specific optimizations.

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

*Ziyang Leng,Jiawei Yang,Wenlong Yi,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-Occ is a framework for 3D occupancy representation learning in autonomous driving, improving spatiotemporal feature learning and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently aggregating 3D occupancy over time is challenging due to high processing costs and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.

Method: ST-Occ uses a spatiotemporal memory for historical info and memory attention for current occupancy representation with uncertainty/dynamic awareness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU and reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.

Conclusion: ST-Occ effectively enhances spatiotemporal representation for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.
