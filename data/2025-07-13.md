### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) to address mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL approaches lack solutions for mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MMoE includes description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and intra/inter-level mixture of experts for dynamic feature selection.

Result: MMoE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MMoE effectively addresses key challenges in MEL, offering a robust solution with dynamic feature selection.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT) leverages domain-agnostic text embeddings for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA for segmentation lacks utilization of domain-agnostic text properties, despite advances in vision-language representation learning.

Method: CoPT uses LLM-generated domain descriptions and CLIP embeddings to learn domain-invariant features via a covariance-based loss.

Result: CoPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four UDA segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoPT effectively bridges the gap between vision-language models and UDA for segmentation, improving generalization.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework to test the robustness of unlearning techniques in image generation models, revealing vulnerabilities in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal concerns of AI-generated content by evaluating the effectiveness of machine unlearning in diffusion-based models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: Proposes Recall, a framework using adversarial image prompts guided by a reference image to test unlearning robustness.

Result: Recall outperforms existing methods in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity, exposing vulnerabilities in unlearning techniques.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust unlearning solutions to ensure the safety of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

### [4] [Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07148)
*Getamesay Haile Dagnaw,Yanming Zhu,Muhammad Hassan Maqsood,Wencheng Yang,Xingshuai Dong,Xuefei Yin,Alan Wee-Chung Liew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive review of XAI methods in biomedical image analysis, focusing on modality-aware approaches, multimodal learning, and vision-language models, while offering practical guidance and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing XAI surveys by providing a modality-aware perspective, covering recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and offering practical guidance for biomedical image analysis.

Method: Systematic categorization and analysis of XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy, and examining multimodal learning and vision-language models.

Result: A structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical contexts, highlighting challenges and opportunities, along with evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks.

Conclusion: The survey lays a foundation for advancing interpretable deep learning in biomedical image analysis, addressing persistent challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to modality conflicts, introduces the MMMC dataset, and tests three methods to mitigate the issue, with reinforcement learning performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in MLLMs caused by inherent conflicts in multimodal inputs, a problem overlooked by prior research.

Method: Defines modality conflict, constructs the MMMC dataset, and evaluates three approaches: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperforms others in reducing hallucinations; supervised fine-tuning is stable and promising.

Conclusion: Highlights the impact of modality conflict on hallucinations and advances understanding of MLLM robustness.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments using UAVs, combining YOLOv8 for detection, feature matching, and hue histogram analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous target identification is crucial for applications like search and rescue and threat detection, especially when GNSS is unavailable and visual cues are the only descriptors.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for vessel detection, followed by feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to identify the target, and geometric principles for localization.

Result: Demonstrated in real-world experiments during MBZIRC2023, showing effectiveness in GNSS-denied scenarios. Evaluated detection accuracy and localization precision against an oracle approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method is viable for autonomous maritime surveillance in GNSS-denied environments, with practical applications in search and rescue and threat detection.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp is a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network that improves feature extraction and segmentation performance without needing extra labeled data. It introduces two modules for better feature fusion and boundary reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods rely on additional labeled data or task similarity, limiting generalizability. CL-Polyp aims to overcome these challenges using contrastive learning and lightweight modules.

Method: CL-Polyp uses contrastive learning to enhance encoder feature extraction by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs. It includes the MASPP module for multi-scale feature fusion and the CA module for boundary reconstruction.

Result: CL-Polyp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving IoU by 0.011 on Kvasir-SEG and 0.020 on CVC-ClinicDB.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp is effective for polyp segmentation, offering improved performance without additional annotations, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model aligns EEG signals with semantic captions for image reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results by leveraging a transformer-based encoder and latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome EEG's spatial limitations for image reconstruction by using semantic captions as an intermediary.

Method: Aligns EEG signals with multilevel captions via contrastive learning, then uses a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation.

Result: Achieves top performance on EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways and semantic topography.

Conclusion: Semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG, advancing neuroscience and AI interpretability.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

### [9] [A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures, Consistency, and Cinematic Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07202)
*Mohamed Elmoghany,Ryan Rossi,Seunghyun Yoon,Subhojyoti Mukherjee,Eslam Bakr,Puneet Mathur,Gang Wu,Viet Dac Lai,Nedim Lipka,Ruiyi Zhang,Varun Manjunatha,Chien Nguyen,Daksh Dangi,Abel Salinas,Mohammad Taesiri,Hongjie Chen,Xiaolei Huang,Joe Barrow,Nesreen Ahmed,Hoda Eldardiry,Namyong Park,Yu Wang,Jaemin Cho,Anh Totti Nguyen,Zhengzhong Tu,Thien Nguyen,Dinesh Manocha,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Franck Dernoncourt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews 32 video generation methods, identifying key components for long-form, multi-character videos with narrative coherence and high fidelity, and proposes a taxonomy for categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with long-form videos (beyond 16 seconds), especially in maintaining character consistency, scene layouts, and motion coherence. Multi-subject videos further exacerbate these issues.

Method: The authors analyzed 32 papers on video generation to identify architectural components and training strategies that improve long-form video quality. They also developed a taxonomy to categorize methods by design and performance.

Result: The study highlights effective strategies for generating long-form videos with narrative coherence and high fidelity, while also providing a comparative framework for existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights into improving long-form video generation and presents a taxonomy to guide future research and development in the field.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCI, an RGB-only method for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID), using color information to mitigate appearance bias without additional models or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to reliance on extra models or annotations. The paper explores color as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for learning clothing-invariant features.

Method: Introduces CSCI, leveraging foreground and background colors, and S2A self-attention to disentangle color bias from identity features.

Result: Improves baseline by 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video ReID.

Conclusion: Color is a cost-effective solution for appearance bias in CC-ReID, validated by strong performance and no need for extra supervision.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow, resource-intensive mask generation in VFX production.

Method: Uses ML for text-prompted object detection, per-frame segmentation, and video tracking for temporal consistency. Deployed via containerization.

Result: Reduced manual effort, faster preliminary composites, and enhanced VFX production efficiency.

Conclusion: The pipeline improves efficiency and is quickly adopted by artists.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual

comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal language-guided framework, DisenQ, is proposed to disentangle biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features for activity-based person identification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person identification struggles with identity cues entangled in motion and appearance variations. Additional visual data like pose/silhouette often suffer from extraction inaccuracies.

Method: DisenQ, a unified querying transformer, leverages structured textual supervision to disentangle features, ensuring identity cues remain independent of appearance and motion.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and strong generalization to traditional video-based identification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in activity-biometrics, demonstrating robustness and generalization.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

### [13] [LinguaMark: Do Multimodal Models Speak Fairly? A Benchmark-Based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07274)
*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark is a multilingual benchmark for evaluating Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on Visual Question Answering (VQA), revealing biases and performance gaps across languages and social attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs often lack linguistic coverage, leading to biased outputs. Prior work neglects multilingual evaluation, prompting the need for LinguaMark.

Method: LinguaMark evaluates LMMs using 6,875 image-text pairs in 11 languages and five social attributes, measuring Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) perform best overall, while open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) show competitive performance. Qwen2.5 excels in multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: LinguaMark highlights multilingual and fairness gaps in LMMs, providing a benchmark for future research. The dataset and code are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

### [14] [MagiC: Evaluating Multimodal Cognition Toward Grounded Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07297)
*Chengfei Wu,Ronald Seoh,Bingxuan Li,Liqiang Zhang,Fengrong Han,Dan Goldwasser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagiC is a benchmark to evaluate grounded multimodal cognition in vision-language models, assessing reasoning quality and alignment with visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models genuinely perform visual reasoning or rely on biases, MagiC provides a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: MagiC includes 5,500 weakly supervised and 900 human-curated QA examples, evaluating models on correctness, reasoning, grounding, and self-correction.

Result: 15 models (7B-70B parameters) were assessed, revealing limitations in grounded reasoning. New metrics (MagiScore, StepSense) were introduced.

Conclusion: MagiC highlights gaps in current models' visual reasoning and offers insights for improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

### [15] [ADIEE: Automatic Dataset Creation and Scorer for Instruction-Guided Image Editing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07317)
*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE introduces an automated dataset creation approach to train a scoring model for evaluating instruction-guided image editing, outperforming existing models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective automated evaluation in instruction-guided image editing, addressing limitations of current VLMs (alignment issues, lack of transparency, and cost inefficiency).

Method: ADIEE generates a large-scale dataset (100K+ samples) to fine-tune a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model, decoding a numeric score from a custom token.

Result: The scorer outperforms open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, improving score correlation with human ratings by 17.24% and pair-wise comparison accuracy by up to 9.35%.

Conclusion: ADIEE's scorer is effective for automated evaluation, acting as a reward model to enhance edit selection and model fine-tuning, demonstrated by boosting MagicBrush's evaluation score by 8.98%.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive reinforcement learning approach to improve visual storytelling models by enhancing entity identity consistency across frames, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling models often fail to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to referential inconsistencies and hallucinations. This is due to a lack of explicit training on entity connections.

Method: The authors introduce a contrastive reinforcement learning framework, extending the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negatives. They use Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function to fine-tune Qwen Storyteller.

Result: Improvements include grounding mAP (+14.8%), F1 (+17.1%), pronoun grounding accuracy (except "its"), and cross-frame persistence (+13.7%). Well-structured stories increased by 23.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances entity identity consistency in visual storytelling, demonstrating measurable improvements in grounding and story coherence.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC is a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion, enhancing data diversity with minimal annotation effort by synthesizing pseudo geometries and leveraging depth foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable depth completion models requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are labor-intensive to collect. PacGDC addresses this by reducing annotation effort while increasing data diversity.

Method: PacGDC synthesizes pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales of depth maps using multiple depth foundation models. It incorporates interpolation, relocation, and unlabeled images to diversify geometries.

Result: PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PacGDC offers a scalable and efficient solution for generalizable depth completion, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

### [19] [Adaptive Particle-Based Shape Modeling for Anatomical Surface Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07379)
*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSM improves shape modeling by using particles and radial basis functions but lacks self-adaptivity. This paper introduces adaptive mechanisms for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSM methods lack self-adaptivity to local geometric features, limiting their accuracy in representing complex anatomical variability.

Method: Introduces two adaptive mechanisms: a neighborhood correspondence loss and a geodesic correspondence algorithm for regularization.

Result: Evaluated on challenging datasets, showing improved adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and better accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive mechanisms enhance PSM by improving surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSAGSM, a lightweight plug-and-play module for Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos, enhancing GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and spatial attention. It also presents the TTA dataset for table tennis PES benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability, limiting their performance in fine-grained action recognition.

Method: Proposes MSAGSM, combining multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention to improve GSM. Introduces the TTA dataset for benchmarking.

Result: MSAGSM consistently improves performance across five PES benchmarks with minimal overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MSAGSM effectively addresses limitations of existing PES models and advances the field with a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through
Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-category animal motion transfer preserves species-specific habits, leveraging a habit-preservation module and LLM for unobserved species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on human motion and neglect animal habitual behaviors, necessitating a specialized approach for animal motion transfer.

Method: Proposes a generative framework with a habit-preservation module and LLM integration for motion transfer to unobserved species.

Result: Validated on the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, the model outperforms existing methods in preserving habitual behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in animal motion transfer, preserving species-specific habits and enabling generalization to new species.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

*Yongtang Bao,Chengjie Tang,Yuze Wang,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-Wild is a method for interactive segmentation in unconstrained photo collections using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing transient occlusions and lighting inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconstrained photo collections are easier to obtain but suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions, which existing methods fail to address.

Method: Seg-Wild integrates multi-dimensional feature embeddings for 3D Gaussians and uses Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth anomalies. It projects 3D Gaussians to 2D for segmentation.

Result: Seg-Wild outperforms previous methods in segmentation and reconstruction quality for in-the-wild scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles unconstrained scenes and improves segmentation accuracy, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

*Xinan Zhang,Muhammad Zubair Irshad,Anthony Yezzi,Yi-Chang Tsai,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis and amodal completion, outperforming multi-stage methods with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis and amodal completion are multi-stage and inefficient, lacking cross-view dependency consideration.

Method: Uses masked fine-tuning (input-level and feature-level) for an end-to-end model, integrating with image-to-mesh models without extra training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results (PSNR +3.9, Volume IoU +0.28) and reduces reconstruction time by 95%.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ is scalable, efficient, and generalizes well to real-world occluded reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

*Xinyao Yu,Hao Sun,Zeyu Ling,Ziwei Niu,Zhenjia Bai,Rui Qin,Yen-Wei Chen,Lanfen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC introduces an efficient prompt-based strategy for text-image classification, reducing computational costs and trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) are computationally expensive to fine-tune, prompting the need for efficient interaction strategies.

Method: EPIC uses temporal prompts on intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction to align modalities efficiently.

Result: Achieves reduced resource consumption (1% of foundation model parameters) and superior performance on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE, comparable on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC offers a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning LMMs without compromising performance.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of open-source MLLMs in structured reasoning and decision-making tasks.

Method: Hybrid vision encoder, GateMixer connector, MCoT-Instruct-287K dataset, two-stage CoT training, and self-verification inference strategy.

Result: Corvid surpasses similar-scale MLLMs, excelling in mathematical and science reasoning.

Conclusion: Corvid advances MLLM reasoning capabilities, offering a robust solution for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Motivation: Addressing the gap in high-resolution data for industrial anomaly detection, the authors aim to improve accuracy and speed in 3D anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes a scalable pipeline for generating realistic anomalies and introduces Simple3D, which uses Multi-scale Neighborhood Descriptors (MSND) and Local Feature Spatial Aggregation (LFSA) for efficient feature capture.

Result: Simple3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed, achieving real-time inference (20+ fps) on the MiniShift dataset.

Conclusion: High-resolution data and effective feature aggregation are crucial for advancing practical 3D anomaly detection.

Abstract: In industrial point cloud analysis, detecting subtle anomalies demands
high-resolution spatial data, yet prevailing benchmarks emphasize
low-resolution inputs. To address this disparity, we propose a scalable
pipeline for generating realistic and subtle 3D anomalies. Employing this
pipeline, we developed MiniShift, the inaugural high-resolution 3D anomaly
detection dataset, encompassing 2,577 point clouds, each with 500,000 points

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSANet improves ultrasound video segmentation by enhancing noise robustness through dual semantic-aware modules (AFSA and LGSA), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging's noise challenges hinder automated lesion/organ segmentation, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: DSANet uses AFSA for channel-wise feature fusion and LGSA to integrate local and global features, avoiding pixel-level dependencies.

Result: DSANet achieves higher segmentation accuracy and faster inference (FPS) than existing methods.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively addresses noise in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer, and BWV is a key diagnostic feature. Limited research exists on BWV detection in dermatological images, prompting this study.

Method: A non-annotated dataset is converted into an annotated one using color threshold techniques. A custom DCNN is trained on multiple datasets, replacing standard activation layers.

Result: The DCNN achieves 85.71%-95.05% accuracy across datasets. Explainable AI is used to interpret the model's decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed DCNN and XAI approach significantly improve BWV detection, aiding early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Motivation: Addressing boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores, and false positives in existing OoD segmentation methods for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Three-stage framework: Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS), Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC), and Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) for refinement.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (e.g., AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR95 down to 0.07) and improved robustness in real-world driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Objectomaly effectively enhances OoD segmentation by integrating object-level priors, validated by benchmarks and real-world tests.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive

Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the

Motivation: Adverse weather degrades image quality, reducing face recognition accuracy. Existing models lack dedicated modules for weather-induced degradations, leading to distorted facial textures.

Method: Proposes a GAN-based framework with two modules: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) for enhancing structure and color fidelity, and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) for robust feature extraction under adverse weather.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion-based methods, reducing texture distortions and improving facial structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: The SFFT and DAFE modules effectively enhance structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) to protect personal video data from unauthorized use in Visual Object Tracking (VOT), addressing inefficiencies and limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in VOT, where unauthorized use of personal videos for training commercial models is overlooked.

Method: Proposes a novel generative framework for TUEs, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt tracker learning and ensure data-privacy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models and datasets.

Conclusion: The TUE framework effectively safeguards video data-privacy in VOT, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Xinyuan Chang,Xinran Liu,Zheng Pan,Mu Xu,Ding Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Map Association (OMA), a benchmark for associating global SD maps with online HD maps to improve autonomous vehicle navigation. It includes a dataset and a baseline method, Map Association Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with integrating global SD maps and online HD maps for hybrid navigation, limiting their planning capabilities.

Method: Proposes the OMA benchmark with a dataset (480k roads, 260k lanes) and a baseline method, Map Association Transformer, using path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: OMA enhances autonomous vehicle navigation by providing a framework for associating hybrid maps, evaluated with proposed metrics.

Conclusion: The OMA benchmark and Map Association Transformer address the gap in hybrid map association, improving autonomous vehicle planning.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMPO introduces a novel method for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by minimizing reverse KL divergence, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving diffusion models by aligning them with human preferences, addressing suboptimal optimization in existing methods.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), which minimizes reverse KL divergence for alignment.

Result: DMPO outperforms existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across datasets.

Conclusion: DMPO provides a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment in diffusion models, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion introduces a group graph dynamics-kinematics network to model human motion by leveraging physical dependencies between joints, improving realism and performance in motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect intrinsic physical dependencies in human motion, leading to unrealistic outputs and increased learning difficulty.

Method: GGMotion uses a group graph network with radial fields for spatio-temporal dependencies, inter/intra-group interaction modules, and equivariant MLPs for joint feature updates. An auxiliary loss supervises motion priors.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, achieving superior short-term motion prediction.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively captures physical dependencies, enhancing motion realism and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled data in this field. It includes diverse scenes, segmentation masks, and a baseline method for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in 4D object segmentation for dynamic scenes by providing a comprehensive, labeled multi-view video dataset, as current methods lack sufficient data.

Method: The method involves collecting and annotating 17 diverse scenes with multi-view videos, providing RGB images, segmentation masks, and a baseline segmentation approach.

Result: The result is the MUVOD dataset, containing 7830 RGB images with segmentation masks, 459 instances of 73 categories, and a subset for 3D object segmentation benchmarking.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights MUVOD as a benchmark for advancing 4D and 3D object segmentation, with available data and metrics to foster progress in the field.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spline-based trajectory representation for dense points, addressing limitations of neural networks and explicit techniques, and introduces a low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for trajectory modeling either lack spatial coherence due to neural network biases or rely on heuristic-based explicit techniques. The potential of implicit representations for sparse temporal signals is under-explored.

Method: A spline-based trajectory representation with explicit knot degrees of freedom is proposed, along with a low-rank time-variant spatial encoding to model knot characteristics.

Result: The method excels in temporal interpolation for sparse inputs and achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction while improving motion coherence.

Conclusion: The spline-based approach outperforms existing methods in preserving spatial coherence and temporal accuracy without relying on traditional constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX introduces a remote sensing foundation model using mixture-of-modality experts to address modality mismatches and efficiency issues in pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models focus on specific modalities, causing mismatches for diverse applications and making fine-tuning costly.

Method: MAPEX uses a modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and modality-aware pruning to create efficient, task-specific models.

Result: MAPEX outperforms fully supervised training and state-of-the-art models on diverse remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: MAPEX provides an efficient, adaptable solution for multi-modal remote sensing tasks, simplifying fine-tuning and deployment.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [39] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'linear reasoning bottleneck' in VLMs, measured by the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), and shows it stems from language model reasoning failures, not perception. Task-dependent interventions can solve this, with postfix tuning revealing dormant reasoning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why VLMs struggle with abstract reasoning tasks despite good perception, focusing on the limitations of their visual embeddings' linear separability.

Method: Introduces the LSC metric, uses postfix tuning to analyze reasoning pathways, and tests task-dependent interventions (activating pathways or adapting weights).

Result: VLMs have dormant reasoning capabilities, but complex tasks require deeper adaptation. Improving representation quality can fail on new prompts.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs depends on targeted alignment, not just better representation learning, offering a new analysis framework.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGKD-WLSS improves weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light by combining diffusion-guided knowledge distillation and depth-guided feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in low-light due to degraded image quality and weak supervision constraints, leading to unreliable class activation maps.

Method: Proposes DGKD-WLSS, using diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation for feature alignment, and depth maps for structural feature enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-light weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS effectively addresses low-light challenges, offering a robust solution for weakly-supervised segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Method: Uses hierarchical adapter modules, shared subspace projection, MTL Decoder, and Sinkhorn-K-means clustering for anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieves 97.5% AUC, 70.4% AP, and 95.2% PRO on MVTec AD, outperforming recent models.

framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the

97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOTA is a multi-scale inference strategy for 3D flood mapping, improving accuracy and coverage without retraining, demonstrated in a case study with significant IoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flood mapping products lack spatial detail or ignore depth, limiting disaster response effectiveness.

Method: HOTA uses overlapping tiles on Sentinel-2 images with SegFormer and a DEM-based depth module for 3D mapping.

Result: HOTA improves IoU from 73% to 84% and achieves <0.5m boundary error in the Kempsey flood case.

Conclusion: HOTA enables accurate, large-scale 3D flood mapping for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack consistency and quality in multi-view outputs, which are essential for applications like digital humans and virtual avatars.

Method: The framework includes a multi-view training data generation pipeline with a Bald Converter, data-augment inpainting model, and face-finetuned multi-view diffusion model. It uses polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention layers for pose conditioning and smooth transitions.

Result: The method achieves accurate, detailed, and realistic hairstyle transfers with seamless consistency across views, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 advances multi-view hair transfer, offering robust and high-quality results for real-world applications.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: Trainless, low-overhead improvements effectively boost long-term tracking performance.

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy and sparse labels from image-based VLMs in 3D point clouds for driving settings.

Method: Consolidate labels for spatio-temporal consistency and robustness, then train a 3D network (LOSC).

Result: Outperforms SOTA in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: LOSC is a simple yet effective method for improving segmentation accuracy in lidar scans.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant

### [46] [SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610)
*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing performance gaps and unexpected behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for spatial visualization in MLLMs are inadequate, often overlapping with training data, leading to unreliable assessments.

Method: Developed SpatialViz-Bench with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities (1,180 problems) and evaluated 33 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs show wide performance variations, unexpected behaviors, and deficiencies in spatial visualization.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench highlights MLLMs' limitations in spatial visualization, filling a critical gap in evaluation.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

*Marc Lafon,Yannis Karmim,Julio Silva-Rodriguez,Paul Couairon,Clément Rambour,Raphaël Fournier-Sniehotta,Ismail Ben Ayed,Jose Dolz,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLU is a new framework for uncertainty quantification in Vision-Language Models, using multi-modal representations and a binary classifier for failure prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Method: ViLU integrates visual and textual embeddings via cross-attention, training a binary classifier for uncertainty prediction using weighted binary cross-entropy loss.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on datasets like ImageNet-1k, CC12M, and LAION-400M.

Conclusion: ViLU effectively quantifies uncertainty in VLMs, especially in post-hoc settings, with its architecture and training being key to its success.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

### [48] [T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633)
*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-GVC is a novel generative video coding framework that uses trajectory-guided motion sampling and diffusion processes to improve video reconstruction in ultra-low bitrate scenarios, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods are limited by domain specificity or reliance on high-level text guidance, leading to unrealistic reconstructions and missed motion details.

Method: T-GVC employs semantic-aware sparse motion sampling and trajectory-aligned loss constraints in diffusion processes for motion guidance.

Result: T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art methods in ultra-low bitrate conditions and achieves better motion control than text-guided approaches.

Conclusion: T-GVC introduces a new direction for generative video coding by combining geometric motion modeling with generative priors.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

*F. Xavier Gaya-Morey,Julia Sanchez-Perez,Cristina Manresa-Yee,Jose M. Buades-Rubio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates age-related bias in deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, focusing on the elderly. It identifies disparities in recognition and attention patterns, proposes three mitigation strategies, and demonstrates improved accuracy for elderly individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning FER models often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with age, compromising fairness and reliability. This study aims to understand and mitigate these biases, especially for the elderly.

Method: The study uses Explainable AI (XAI) to analyze biases, then proposes and evaluates three strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Models are trained on AffectNet with estimated age labels and validated on balanced datasets.

Result: Results show improved recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for expressions like "neutral", "sadness", and "anger". Saliency heatmaps confirm more relevant facial region attention for each age group.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be mitigated with simple training modifications, and approximate demographic labels are valuable for promoting fairness in affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

*Fengqian Pang,Chunyue Lei,Hongfei Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Zhiqiang Xing,Huafeng Wang,Chuyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolCLIP combines cell video and molecular data to improve drug MoA recognition, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on spatial cell features but ignore temporal dynamics and molecular data, limiting MoA recognition accuracy.

Method: MolCLIP integrates microscopic cell videos and molecular data using a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and metric learning.

Result: MolCLIP improves drug identification and MoA recognition by 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP, respectively, on MitoDataset.

Conclusion: Combining temporal cell dynamics and molecular data enhances MoA recognition, with MolCLIP demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model for efficient keypoint annotation in cervical vertebrae radiographs, aiding growth potential prediction in pediatric orthodontics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate growth potential estimation is crucial for effective orthodontic treatment, but manual keypoint annotation is labor-intensive.

Method: ARNet, a user-interactive deep learning model, uses Interaction-guided recalibration and morphology-aware loss to streamline keypoint annotation.

Result: ARNet reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and shows strong performance across datasets.

Conclusion: The research provides an AI-assisted tool for growth assessment, advancing pediatric orthodontics.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, an AU-enhanced dynamic facial expression recognition architecture, integrating AU-expression knowledge to improve deep learning models. It outperforms SOTA methods and addresses label imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating quantified AU-expression knowledge into deep learning models and tackling data label imbalance.

Method: Proposes AU-DFER, integrating AU loss and a weight matrix to combine AU-expression knowledge with deep learning outcomes. Validated on mainstream DFER datasets.

Result: AU-DFER outperforms SOTA methods without extra computation and improves results. Also addresses label imbalance effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating AU-expression knowledge and redesigning loss functions can significantly enhance DFER, highlighting the importance of addressing data imbalance.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Kosuke Nishida,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationale-enhanced decoding (RED) to address the issue of LVLMs ignoring generated rationales in CoT reasoning, improving multi-modal reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore generated rationales in CoT reasoning, undermining grounding and accuracy.

Method: Reformulate multi-modal CoT as KL-constrained reward maximization and propose RED, a plug-and-play decoding strategy that harmonizes visual and rationale information.

Result: RED consistently improves reasoning accuracy over standard CoT and other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs.

Conclusion: RED enhances the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, advancing reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

*Peixian Zhuang,Yijian Wang,Zhenqi Fu,Hongliang Zhang,Sam Kwong,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Tree-Mamba method is proposed for underwater monocular depth estimation, addressing challenges like degraded images and unreliable labels, and a new benchmark (BlueDepth) is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods struggle with UMDE due to inflexible state scanning and unreliable depth labels in datasets.

Method: Tree-Mamba uses a tree-aware scanning strategy to adaptively construct a minimum spanning tree for feature aggregation, enhancing multi-scale representation.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperforms leading methods in accuracy and efficiency, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The Tree-Mamba method and BlueDepth benchmark significantly improve underwater depth estimation, offering reliable solutions and resources.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address local motion blur in images by using a trainable mask predictor and an intra-frame motion analyzer, optimizing computational efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring methods struggle with inefficient resource allocation and handling spatially varying blur patterns.

Method: The approach involves a trainable mask predictor to identify blurred regions and an intra-frame motion analyzer for adaptive blur restoration. Computational efficiency is improved via structural reparameterization.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing FLOPs by 49% while achieving superior performance on blur datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses local motion blur with improved efficiency and accuracy, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: CrossVLAD is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models (VLMs), introducing CRAFT, an efficient attack method outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security challenges in unified VLMs where adversarial inputs must remain effective across unpredictable task instructions.

Method: Introduces CrossVLAD, a dataset from MSCOCO with GPT-4 annotations, and CRAFT, a region-centric attack framework for cross-task adversarial attacks.

Result: CRAFT outperforms existing methods in cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of CRAFT in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: The paper revisits the 'Name that dataset' task for chest X-ray datasets to explore bias, applying transformations to increase difficulty and testing various network architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if dataset bias exists in popular open-source chest X-ray datasets, given the sensitivity of medical data and the importance of unbiased AI in medical imaging.

Method: Applied dataset transformations to identify bias and tested multiple network architectures on NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest datasets.

Result: Highlights the presence of bias in medical datasets and aims to encourage explainable research and more open-source medical datasets.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for unbiased AI in medical imaging and promotes transparency and open-source data in the field.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simplified 3D promptable segmentation method is introduced, addressing the limitations of SAM in 3D medical imaging by reducing inference time and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's 2D design doesn't extend well to 3D medical data, and existing 3D methods are computationally heavy and complex.

Method: The proposed method simplifies 3D segmentation, inspired by SegVol, avoiding sliding-window inference and prompt management issues.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced inference time and complexity.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for 3D medical imaging segmentation, improving efficiency and usability.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by proposing an energy-based decoding method that dynamically selects hidden states to balance the 'Yes' ratio and improve performance across VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs are limited by decoding restrictions, complex visual input modifications, or reliance on external models. The paper identifies an imbalance in 'Yes' ratios across VQA datasets and aims to reduce bias.

Method: An energy-based decoding method is introduced, dynamically selecting hidden states from layers with minimal energy scores to balance 'Yes' ratios and enhance performance.

Result: The method improves accuracy by 4.82% and reduces the yes-ratio gap by 8.81% across three VQA benchmarks (POPE, MME, MMVP), outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-based decoding effectively reduces bias and enhances performance in LVLMs, offering a simple yet impactful solution for safer deployment.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream SNN improves early human activity recognition with 2% higher accuracy on THU EACT-50, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early human activity recognition is vital for safety and responsiveness in human-robot interfaces, leveraging event-based vision sensors for low latency.

Method: A high-rate two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) processes events without accumulating them into low-rate frames, enhancing early prediction.

Result: The SNN achieves 2% higher final accuracy on THU EACT-50 and demonstrates improved early recognition in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method advances early event-based recognition, with practical impact shown in sports motion capture.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDST, a sparse-dense side-tuning architecture for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), addressing limitations of prior methods by focusing on sparse moment retrieval and enhancing context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VTG rely on frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting adaptability. Side-tuning (ST) is efficient but overlooks the sparse nature of Moment Retrieval (MR).

Method: Proposes SDST, an anchor-free ST architecture, and Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention for better context modeling. Integrates InternVideo2 backbone into ST.

Result: Significant improvement over existing ST methods, achieving competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, with 73% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SDST effectively addresses the limitations of prior ST methods, offering a parameter-efficient and high-performing solution for VTG.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

*Charlie Budd,Silvère Ségaud,Matthew Elliot,Graeme Stasiuk,Yijing Xie,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-RAFT improves cross-modal image correspondence in neurosurgery by reducing errors by 36.6% over a baseline and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical decision-making with real-time quantitative fluorescence via hyperspectral imaging.

Method: Modified RAFT optical flow model (X-RAFT) with distinct encoders for each modality, fine-tuned self-supervised using flow-cycle-consistency.

Result: 36.6% error reduction over baseline and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively addresses cross-modal correspondence challenges in neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method improves geometric accuracy in additive manufacturing by comparing CAD and XCT volumes, outperforming traditional DVC methods with faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality control in AM is crucial for industries like automotive and aerospace, but geometric inaccuracies from shrinkage and deformations pose challenges. Current DVC methods struggle with registration accuracy and computational demands.

Method: The paper introduces a deep learning approach using dynamic patch-based processing to estimate voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes, evaluated with Dice Score and Binary Difference Map (BDM).

Result: The method improves Dice Score by 9.2% and voxel match rate by 9.9%, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: This work enables more reliable and efficient AM production, with potential for closed-loop compensation in manufacturing.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOOTER is a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, providing guidelines, tools, and a benchmark dataset. It reveals gaps between human perception and automated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unrestricted adversarial attacks bypass traditional defenses, but lack imperceptibility guarantees. A unified framework is needed for statistically significant human evaluations.

Method: Introduces SCOOTER, an open-source framework with guidelines, tools, and a dataset. Conducts large-scale human vs. model comparisons.

Result: Human evaluations show six attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. GPT-4o detects only four attacks.

Conclusion: Automated vision systems misalign with human perception, highlighting the need for SCOOTER as a benchmark.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study on calibration techniques for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training methods, with practical guidelines for robust calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve calibration robustness under real-world dataset shifts for image classification tasks.

Method: Comparison of post-hoc calibration methods and in-training strategies (e.g., label smoothing) across eight classification tasks and natural shifts.

Result: Key findings include the effectiveness of entropy regularization with label smoothing, robustness of post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure, and trade-offs between in-distribution and shifted calibration. Ensembling and finetuning foundation models yield the best results.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines for robust calibration under shift, emphasizing the effectiveness of ensembling and finetuning, while noting trade-offs and limitations of recent methods.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset for evaluating language-guided spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, addressing biases in existing datasets and challenging current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks focus on spatial reasoning, with datasets often mixing semantic cues, leading to superficial model interpretations.

Method: The authors create S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with 200k+ vision-language pairs and 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries, deliberately excluding object names to avoid biases.

Result: Benchmarks show current 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs struggle with the dataset, highlighting its necessity.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D and the 3D-SRS benchmark aim to advance spatially aware AI for embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network using 3D CNNs and a differential frame fusion module for accurate heart rate measurement from facial videos, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models lack accuracy, robustness, and generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses 3D CNNs, differential frame fusion, TSM with self-attention, and a dynamic hybrid loss function.

Result: Achieved MAE of 7.58 on MMPD test set, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates superior robustness and generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT improves Visual Prompt Tuning by generating instance-aware prompts fused with dataset-level prompts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VPT uses fixed dataset-level prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance due to dataset variance.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts per input, combines them with dataset-level prompts using PCA, and reduces learnable parameters.

Result: ViaPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 34 datasets.

Conclusion: ViaPT sets a new paradigm for optimizing visual prompts in vision transformers by balancing instance and dataset knowledge.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Synergistic Prompting (SyP) to address performance degradation in multi-modal models due to missing inputs, introducing dynamic adapters and a synergistic strategy for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods fail to adapt to varying missing-data conditions and struggle with reliability when critical modalities are missing.

Method: SyP uses a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to balance modality information.

Result: SyP outperforms existing methods on three datasets, showing robustness under diverse missing conditions.

Conclusion: SyP effectively handles missing modalities with superior adaptability and reliability, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based method for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting, comparing patient-specific and multi-patient training strategies. PS models excel with larger datasets, while MP models generalize better without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lung tumor motion forecasting is crucial for proton therapy, but transformer-based methods are unexplored despite their success in trajectory forecasting.

Method: Uses ViT for tumor motion prediction, comparing patient-specific (PS) and multi-patient (MP) training. Evaluated on 31 patients' DRRs, with metrics ADE and FDE.

Result: PS models outperform MP on planning data but MP models generalize better to treatment data without retraining.

Conclusion: ViT is effective for markerless tumor motion forecasting; PS models offer precision, while MP models provide robust, ready-to-use performance.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of content-based puzzle solvers under corruptions like missing pieces and eroded edges, finding deep learning models, especially Positional Diffusion, adapt better than heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing puzzle solvers lack evaluation under realistic corruptions, crucial for real-world applications like artefact reassembly.

Method: Introduces three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions, evaluates heuristic and deep learning solvers, and analyzes their performance.

Result: Standard solvers decline rapidly with corruption, but deep learning models improve robustness through fine-tuning. Positional Diffusion performs best.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for enhanced solvers for real-world applications and suggests promising research directions.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

TL;DR: SimCIS addresses plasticity loss and data order reliance in continual image segmentation by leveraging query-based transformers and feature alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues of plasticity loss and heavy reliance on input data order in decoupled frameworks for continual image segmentation.

Method: Proposes SimCIS, which selects image features for query assignment to ensure perfect alignment and introduces cross-stage consistency and a visual query-based replay mechanism.

Result: SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS is a simple yet powerful baseline for continual image segmentation, effectively addressing key challenges and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale dataset for 3D anomaly detection in manufacturing, addressing the lack of real-world industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects significantly impact manufacturing yield, but current datasets and methods fall short in real-world settings.

Method: 3D-ADAM includes 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 parts, with 27,346 annotated defects and 8,110 machine element features, captured under real industrial conditions.

Result: Evaluation shows current SOTA models struggle with 3D-ADAM, highlighting its challenge and industrial relevance.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM aims to advance robust 3D anomaly detection models for manufacturing.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: THUNDER offers a reliable, fast, and flexible tool for evaluating digital pathology models, with publicly available code for broader adoption.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

### [75] [Single-Step Latent Diffusion for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07878)
*Jiayi Wu,Tianfu Wang,Md Abu Bakr Siddique,Md Jahidul Islam,Cornelia Fermuller,Yiannis Aloimonos,Christopher A. Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLURPP combines latent diffusion models and scene decomposition for efficient underwater image restoration, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based underwater image restoration methods are slow and produce artifacts in complex scenes.

Method: SLURPP integrates pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition and uses a physics-based synthetic data pipeline for training.

Result: SLURPP is 200X faster than current methods and improves PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks, with better real-world performance.

Conclusion: SLURPP advances underwater image restoration by combining efficiency, accuracy, and realistic results.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

*Jinhong Wang,Tajamul Ashraf,Zongyan Han,Jorma Laaksonen,Rao Mohammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The MIRA framework improves factual accuracy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic context adjustment and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually inconsistent responses in medical diagnosis, and RAG, while helpful, faces challenges like insufficient or excessive retrieval and over-reliance on retrieved data.

Method: MIRA introduces a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module for dynamic context adjustment and a medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a knowledge base with query-rewrite for multimodal reasoning.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art results in medical VQA and report generation benchmarks, significantly improving factual accuracy.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively balances inherent model knowledge and external references, enhancing MLLM performance in medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

*Mateusz Wasala,Mateusz Smolarczyk,Michal Danilowicz,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an embedded implementation of an unsupervised feature point detection and description architecture using a quantised SuperPoint CNN, optimized for resource-limited platforms like FPGAs, achieving high performance (54 fps) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate position estimation is crucial for autonomous navigation systems, and VSLAM relies on reliable feature extraction. The goal is to reduce computational demands without sacrificing detection quality for efficient deployment on mobile or embedded systems.

Method: The authors propose a quantised SuperPoint CNN, implemented on an AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA SoC, using Brevitas and FINN for quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. Performance was evaluated on the TUM dataset.

Result: The solution processes 640 x 480 pixel images at 54 fps on an FPGA, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on the TUM dataset assessed quantisation techniques' impact on accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: The embedded implementation successfully balances computational efficiency and detection quality, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms in visual odometry tasks.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy called CiCi is proposed for rPPG tasks, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency in signals to enhance model adaptation during inference, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods for rPPG face limitations due to privacy concerns and real-time adaptation needs, prompting the need for a more adaptable solution.

Method: The CiCi framework integrates expert knowledge-based self-supervised learning, using consistency and inconsistency priors in rPPG signals, along with a gradient dynamic control mechanism.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets under TTA, excelling in real-time self-supervised adaptation without source data access.

Conclusion: The CiCi framework effectively addresses real-world deployment challenges in rPPG, offering robust and stable adaptation during inference.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

*Juan Pablo Oberhauser,Daniel Grzenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time ID algorithm for mice in home cages improves tracking accuracy and reduces ID switches by combining custom ear tags, object tracking, and transformer-based classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated monitoring of mice is challenging due to their similar appearances, high mobility, and dense housing. Accurate ID assignment is needed for better data collection and welfare.

Method: Developed a three-part pipeline: (1) MouseTracks for tracking, (2) Mouseformer for ID classification, and (3) MouseMap for final ID assignment. Uses custom ear tags and cameras.

Result: Achieves 30 fps ID assignment with 24/7 coverage, outperforming existing methods in tracking efficiency and reducing ID switches.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables precise, real-time monitoring of mice, enhancing research accuracy and animal welfare.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

TL;DR: A framework for scaling vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos using reinforcement learning, featuring a dataset, training pipeline, and efficient infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of long video reasoning in VLMs by integrating large-scale data, advanced training methods, and optimized infrastructure.

Method: Combines a dataset (LongVideo-Reason), a two-stage training pipeline (CoT-SFT and RL), and MR-SP infrastructure for efficient long video RL training.

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B outperforms benchmarks like VideoMME and matches Gemini-1.5-Pro in reasoning tasks, with MR-SP achieving 2.1x speedup.

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1 advances long video reasoning in VLMs, with released infrastructure supporting multimodal RL training on hour-long videos.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: A method for synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos using M3arsSynth for 3D reconstruction and MarsGen for video generation, outperforming terrestrial-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality Martian landscape videos for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation, despite data scarcity and domain gaps.

Method: Combines M3arsSynth (3D reconstruction from stereo images) and MarsGen (video synthesis conditioned on initial frames or prompts).

Result: Superior visual fidelity and 3D consistency compared to terrestrial-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses Martian video synthesis challenges, enabling realistic simulations.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

*Haoyu Wu,Diankun Wu,Tianyu He,Junliang Guo,Yang Ye,Yueqi Duan,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometry Forcing, a method to enhance video diffusion models by aligning their representations with 3D geometric features, improving visual quality and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models often lack geometric-aware structure despite videos being projections of a 3D world. The goal is to bridge this gap.

Method: Geometry Forcing aligns video diffusion models' representations with a pretrained geometric foundation model using Angular Alignment (cosine similarity) and Scale Alignment (feature regression).

Result: The method improves visual quality and 3D consistency in camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively enhances video diffusion models by incorporating latent 3D representations, outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Online Spatio-Temporal understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), highlighting challenges in dynamic reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate MLLMs offline with fixed inputs, but real-world embodied perception requires online, incremental reasoning over dynamic scenes.

Method: OST-Bench uses 1.4k scenes and 10k QA pairs from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes to test MLLMs on complex spatio-temporal tasks.

Result: Leading MLLMs struggle with online spatio-temporal reasoning, showing declining accuracy as exploration and memory demands increase.

Conclusion: OST-Bench identifies core challenges in online embodied reasoning and provides resources to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how data properties affect CLIP's ability to learn binding, identifying key issues like low attribute density and saliency bias in natural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs), and prior fixes (e.g., hard negatives) failed. The study explores data's role in this limitation.

Method: Uses a synthetic dataset to rigorously analyze data properties (e.g., attribute density, caption completeness, saliency bias) and their impact on CLIP's binding performance.

Result: Natural data properties hinder binding; scaling batch size or adding hard negatives doesn't help. Only data with specific properties enables reliable binding.

Conclusion: Data properties are critical for CLIP's binding ability, suggesting future work should focus on improving data design rather than model architecture or training tricks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: STTM is a training-free method for merging spatio-temporal tokens in video LLMs, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face quadratic computational scaling with token count, prompting the need for efficient token reduction without training.

Method: STTM transforms frames into multi-granular spatial tokens via quadtree search and merges them temporally.

Result: STTM achieves 2×-3× speed-ups with minimal accuracy drops (0.5%-2%) under token budgets of 50%-30%.

Conclusion: STTM efficiently reduces computational overhead in video LLMs by leveraging spatial-temporal redundancy, enabling KV cache reuse.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASIC, a unified evaluation framework for brain visual decoding, addressing limitations of coarse metrics by focusing on structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding lack granularity, neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained distinctions, necessitating a more robust framework.

Method: BASIC uses hierarchical segmentation-based metrics for structural fidelity and multimodal large language models for semantic-level comparisons, benchmarking diverse decoding methods.

Result: The framework provides discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive evaluation of brain visual decoding methods.

Conclusion: BASIC offers a more refined and neuroscientifically grounded approach to evaluating visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

TL;DR: A framework for few-shot keypoint detection using sketches, overcoming cross-modal and style challenges with prototypical adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of source data in few-shot keypoint detection by leveraging sketches as a source-free alternative.

Method: Uses a prototypical setup with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation.

Result: Demonstrates success in few-shot convergence for novel keypoints and classes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap in few-shot keypoint detection using sketches.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel

### [89] [Single-pass Adaptive Image Tokenization for Minimum Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07995)
*Shivam Duggal,Sanghyun Byun,William T. Freeman,Antonio Torralba,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity, predicting token count for images in one forward pass, matching performance of multi-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length representations ignore input complexity variations; adaptive methods require test-time search. KARL aims to simplify this by predicting token count in a single pass.

Method: KARL uses a single-pass approach, halting once approximate Kolmogorov Complexity is reached. Training resembles Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, predicting halting based on reconstruction quality.

Result: KARL matches adaptive tokenizers' performance while operating in one pass. Scaling laws analyze encoder/decoder size and tokenization types.

Conclusion: KARL aligns with Algorithmic Information Theory, showing intuitive complexity predictions across structure, noise, and familiarity axes.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

*Mingkai Jia,Wei Yin,Xiaotao Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiao-Xiao Long,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-VAEs compress visual data into discrete tokens, but lag behind VAEs. The proposed method, \NickName, enhances codebook representation, improves reconstruction, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To narrow the performance gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs by improving quantization and minimizing information loss.

Method: Retains latent dimensions and uses sub-codebooks for quantization. Evaluated on 512p and 2k benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks, with better rFID and PSNR than SD-VAE.

Conclusion: \NickName excels in reconstruction, advancing HD image processing fidelity.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD
image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, featuring traceable evidence and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR, a training paradigm, improves performance on benchmarks like TreeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing benchmark holistically evaluates visual grounded reasoning capabilities, prompting the creation of TreeBench.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence, and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR uses reinforcement learning to jointly supervise localization and reasoning.

Result: Advanced models struggle on TreeBench (e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores 54.87%). TreeVGR improves performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traceability is key for advancing vision-grounded reasoning, as demonstrated by TreeBench and TreeVGR.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### [92] [Impact of Pretraining Word Co-occurrence on Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08000)
*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how word co-occurrence statistics in CLIP/LMM pretraining data affect compositional generalization, showing strong correlations between PMI and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how concept combinations in training data impact CLIP/LMM performance, especially for uncommon pairings.

Method: Measure co-occurrence with PMI, test on synthetic and edited natural images, and evaluate CLIP/LMM performance.

Result: Strong correlation between PMI and accuracy (r=0.97 for CLIP), with effects transferring to LMMs (r=0.70 for TextVQA).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better algorithms to improve compositional generalization without scaling training data combinatorially.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

*Marie-Christine Pali,Christina Schwaiger,Malik Galijasevic,Valentin K. Ladenhauf,Stephanie Mangesius,Elke R. Gizewski*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning approach for carotid artery segmentation in multi-sequence MRI, addressing plaque complexity and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery plaques in MRI is vital for assessing atherosclerosis and stroke risk, but challenges include plaque complexity and scarce labeled data.

Method: Proposes a two-network system: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation, using a multi-level multi-sequence U-Net and semi-supervised learning with input transformations.

Result: Evaluated on 52 patients, the approach shows effectiveness, with fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning improving segmentation.

Conclusion: Fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning enhance carotid artery segmentation in MRI, especially with limited data.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning autoencoders (D-CNN and VQ-VAE) for compressing industrial XCT data, evaluating their impact on recovered data quality and introducing an edge-preservation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient storage of large imaging datasets due to advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: Used D-CNN and VQ-VAE with varying compression rates on XCT data from a sandstone sample, comparing decoded image quality to original data. Introduced an edge-preservation metric.

Result: Different architectures and compression rates suit varying data preservation needs. Edge-preservation metrics improved decoding quality assessment.

Conclusion: The findings guide scientists in selecting appropriate compression strategies for data storage and analysis.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GridTD is an unsupervised continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction, combining multi-resolution grid encoding and tensor decomposition for efficient and accurate high-dimensional image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised representations for CI reconstruction struggle to balance representation ability and efficiency, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: GridTD integrates a lightweight neural network with tensor decomposition, optimized via multi-resolution hash grid encoding, leveraging hierarchical modeling and compactness.

Result: Theoretical analyses and experiments on tasks like video SCI and dynamic MRI show GridTD outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: GridTD is a versatile, state-of-the-art solution for CI reconstruction, offering superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

TL;DR: A generative framework synthesizes breast ultrasound images using clinical descriptions and structural masks, enhancing deep learning models for breast cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of expert-annotated breast ultrasound (BUS) images limits robust deep learning model development.

Method: The framework integrates clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, controlled by characteristics like morphology and echogenicity. A semantic-curvature mask generator creates diverse tumor masks.

Result: Synthetic BUS images improve downstream diagnosis tasks, validated by quantitative evaluations and visual Turing tests by sonographers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data scarcity, producing realistic synthetic images with potential for broader clinical use.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework integrates multimodal data (CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, genomic) to improve recurrence prediction in ccRCC, addressing limitations of single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prognostic models for ccRCC, relying on single data modalities, often fail to capture disease complexity, leading to suboptimal predictive accuracy.

Method: The framework uses domain-specific models (CLAM for histopathology, MeD-3D for CT/MRI, MLP for clinical/genomic data) to extract features, fused via early/late integration, and handles incomplete data.

Result: The multimodal DL approach enhances predictive accuracy for ccRCC recurrence by leveraging complementary data sources.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data with DL improves recurrence prediction in ccRCC, offering potential for better clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

*Abrar Faiyaz,Nhat Hoang,Giovanni Schifitto,Md Nasir Uddin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ArteryX is a MATLAB-based toolbox for quantifying cerebrovascular features from 3D TOF MRA, addressing challenges in existing methods with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing cerebral vasculature lack standardization and sensitivity to subtle vascular changes, necessitating a more reliable and efficient tool.

Method: ArteryX uses a semi-supervised, vessel-fused network-based landmarking approach to track and manage tracings, minimizing user intervention.

Result: Validated on cerebral small vessel disease patients, ArteryX showed improved sensitivity and outperformed existing semi-automated methods.

Conclusion: ArteryX promises early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons, advancing understanding of vascular contributions to brain health.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
