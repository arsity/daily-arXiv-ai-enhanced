### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual, a novel framework for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR), combines two sub-networks (SAMBA and FIA) to address limitations of traditional methods, outperforming recent approaches in tasks like deraining and dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UHD IR methods (e.g., downsampling or frequency-domain approaches) suffer from irreversible information loss or ineffective artifact handling, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: RetinexDual uses SAMBA for reflectance correction (coarse-to-fine) and FIA for frequency-domain illumination/color correction, leveraging Retinex theory.

Result: RetinexDual excels in UHD IR tasks (deraining, deblurring, dehazing, LLIE), outperforming recent methods in quality and metrics.

Conclusion: RetinexDual's dual-network design and component-specific optimizations are key to its success, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENTRep introduces a grand challenge for ENT endoscopy analysis, combining fine-grained classification with bilingual retrieval tasks, supported by expert-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ENT care lacks robust automated analysis tools due to device variability, subtle findings, and the need for case retrieval. Existing benchmarks rarely support these needs.

Method: The challenge integrates anatomical classification, image-to-image, and text-to-image retrieval using a bilingual dataset with expert annotations and narrative descriptions.

Result: Performance was evaluated on public and private test splits, with results from top teams provided.

Conclusion: ENTRep addresses gaps in ENT endoscopy analysis, offering a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD unifies knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking and joint consensus gating, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods are pretrained in isolation, missing complementary insights and creating impractical large models for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: CoMAD distills from three ViT-Base teachers (MAE, MoCo v3, iBOT) with asymmetric masking, aligning embeddings via linear adapters and layer normalization, and fusing them with joint consensus gating. Training uses dual-level KL divergence.

Result: CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4% Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5% box AP / 40.5% mask AP on MS-COCO, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMAD effectively distills diverse self-supervised knowledge into a compact model, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR introduces a reconstruction-free, attention-based diffusion model for real-time anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based anomaly detection methods face challenges like computational inefficiency, inaccurate reconstructions, and dependency on noise level choices.

Method: RADAR directly generates anomaly maps from diffusion models, bypassing reconstruction steps, and is evaluated on 3D-printed materials and MVTec-AD datasets.

Result: RADAR achieves superior performance, improving F1 scores by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on 3D-printed materials compared to the next best model.

Conclusion: RADAR offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to reconstruction-based anomaly detection, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper aims to accurately track eye movements using event cameras and deep learning, achieving 81% accuracy with a CNN_LSTM model, and suggests future work on interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise eye tracking is challenging due to rapid eye movements and expensive equipment. The goal is to develop a cost-effective, interpretable algorithm for applications in VR/AR.

Method: The study uses deep learning, specifically a CNN_LSTM model, to predict eye center positions from event camera inputs.

Result: The CNN_LSTM model achieved approximately 81% accuracy in eye center prediction.

Conclusion: The research successfully developed an effective model for eye tracking and proposes future enhancements using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for better interpretability and performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN is a 3D human motion prediction model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Lucas polynomial activations, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Method: LuKAN uses discrete wavelet transform for temporal encoding, spatial projection for joint dependencies, and a KAN layer with Lucas polynomials for efficient approximation.

Result: LuKAN outperforms baselines on three datasets, showing competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LuKAN offers an effective, efficient solution for 3D human motion prediction with its compact architecture and Lucas polynomial recurrence.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench is introduced to evaluate MLLMs' ability to identify fine-grained visual clues and integrate them with world knowledge for complex reasoning, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the ability to assess subtle visual clues critical for deep reasoning, necessitating a new evaluation framework.

Method: VER-Bench includes 374 questions across various reasoning types, each with structured evidence (visual clues and reasoning).

Result: The benchmark exposes models' weaknesses in extracting subtle visual evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments.

Conclusion: Enhancing models' capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction and reasoning is essential for genuine visual understanding.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM introduces multi-modal queries and dual-stream attention to improve object detection accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors struggle with occlusions, fine-grained localization, and inefficiency due to fixed queries and dense attention.

Method: DAMM uses appearance-based, positional, and random learned queries, along with dual-stream cross-attention for semantic and spatial refinement.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in AP and recall on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention effectively enhance detection accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of label ambiguity in hateful video detection by analyzing fine-grained, timestamped segments, revealing how coarse annotations introduce noise and affect model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of hate speech in online videos is a critical issue, but existing detection methods rely on noisy, video-level annotations, ignoring temporal granularity.

Method: The study trims hateful videos using annotated timestamps to isolate hateful segments, analyzes their characteristics, and evaluates the impact of label noise on models.

Result: Coarse annotations introduce semantic overlap and confusion, altering model decision boundaries and reducing classification confidence.

Conclusion: Temporally aware models and benchmarks are needed for robust and interpretable hate speech detection.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that dynamically adjusts models to individual test videos, improving generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing highlight detection methods use fixed models, failing to adapt to unique video characteristics, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Highlight-TTA dynamically adapts models during testing using cross-modality hallucinations as an auxiliary task, optimized via meta-auxiliary training.

Result: Experiments show Highlight-TTA enhances performance of three state-of-the-art models across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA effectively improves video highlight detection by adapting models to test videos, outperforming fixed-model approaches.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to adapt monocular depth estimators for fisheye images using calibration tokens, avoiding retraining and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs trained on perspective images fail on fisheye images due to covariate shift from different camera calibrations.

Method: Uses calibration tokens to align latent embeddings of fisheye images to perspective images, leveraging self-supervised training with recalibrated perspective images.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining, using a lightweight and self-supervised approach.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

### [12] [Toward Errorless Training ImageNet-1k](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04941)
*Bo Deng,Levi Heath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feedforward neural network trained on ImageNet 2012 achieves 98.3% accuracy, with 99.69 Top-1 rate, using a new method. The model has 322M parameters and suggests double-labeling as a reason for not reaching 100%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy in image classification using a new training method on the ImageNet dataset.

Method: Feedforward artificial neural network trained with a novel approach on ImageNet 2012.

Result: Achieves 98.3% accuracy, 99.69 Top-1 rate, and 285.9 perfectly classified labels per batch.

Conclusion: High performance is achieved, but double-labeling in the dataset may prevent 100% accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM enhances vision-language models by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into prompt learning, improving generalization without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories.

Method: ProMIM uses a masking strategy on visible image patches to generate robust, instance-conditioned prompts, augmenting existing methods like CoOp and CoCoOp.

Result: ProMIM consistently improves generalization in zero-shot and few-shot tasks without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM offers a lightweight, effective solution for enhancing vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT enhances weakly supervised dynamic scene graph generation by leveraging relation-aware knowledge and motion-aware attention maps to improve object detection in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WS-DSGG methods rely on external object detectors, which perform poorly in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals.

Method: TRKT uses relation-aware knowledge mining with category-specific attention maps and inter-frame attention augmentation, along with a dual-stream fusion module to refine object localization.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset.

Conclusion: TRKT effectively addresses the limitations of external detectors in WS-DSGG by integrating motion- and relation-aware knowledge, improving detection accuracy.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

### [15] [AdvDINO: Domain-Adversarial Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Spatial Proteomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04955)
*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO is a domain-adversarial SSL framework that enhances domain-invariant feature learning, tested on biomedical imaging to mitigate biases and improve biological representation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SSL methods lack robustness to domain shifts, which is critical in biomedical imaging where batch effects obscure true signals.

Method: Integrates a gradient reversal layer into DINOv2 for domain-invariant features, applied to multiplex immunofluorescence images.

Result: Mitigates slide-specific biases, uncovers phenotype clusters with prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction.

Conclusion: AdvDINO is broadly applicable to domains with domain shifts and limited annotations, enhancing generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse annotations and hierarchical prototype disambiguation to achieve high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation rely on resource-intensive offline learning or densely annotated data, limiting practicality.

Method: HOW-Seg constructs class prototypes on query data, uses sparse human annotations for guidance, refines prototypes hierarchically, and employs a dense CRF for label optimization.

Result: HOW-Seg matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods with sparse annotations and achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2 with denser annotations.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a practical and high-performing solution for open-world segmentation.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

### [17] [UGOD: Uncertainty-Guided Differentiable Opacity and Soft Dropout for Enhanced Sparse-View 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04968)
*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive weighting of Gaussians in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve rendering quality in sparse-view scenarios, using learned uncertainties for opacity updates and soft dropout regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods treat Gaussians equally, leading to overfitting, especially in sparse-view settings. The paper aims to address this by leveraging adaptive weighting.

Method: Proposes learned uncertainties to guide Gaussian opacity updates and employs soft differentiable dropout regularization for rendering.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher quality with fewer Gaussians (e.g., 3.27% PSNR improvement over DropGaussian on MipNeRF 360).

Conclusion: Adaptive weighting via learned uncertainties enhances 3DGS performance in sparse-view scenarios, offering better rendering quality and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends canvas-based attention scheduling for real-time object detection by introducing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, improving performance on edge platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of executing high-resolution object detection under strict latency constraints on limited computing resources in edge platforms.

Method: Extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling by allowing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Improves quality/cost trade-offs, achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements to canvas-based attention scheduling enable better performance and flexibility for real-time perception on edge platforms.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

*Zheng Chen,Mingde Zhou,Jinpei Guo,Jiale Yuan,Yifei Ji,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC is a single-step diffusion image compression model addressing latency and fidelity issues in diffusion-based compression by using informative latents and a fidelity guidance module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image compression suffers from high decoding latency and poor fidelity due to multi-step sampling and over-reliance on generative priors.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained VAE for rich latent information, replaces iterative denoising with single-step decoding, and introduces a fidelity guidance module and rate annealing training.

Result: SODEC outperforms existing methods in rate-distortion-perception performance and improves decoding speed by over 20x.

Conclusion: SODEC effectively addresses the drawbacks of diffusion-based compression, offering faster and higher-fidelity results.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

*Shenglun Chen,Xinzhu Ma,Hong Zhang,Haojie Li,Zhihui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth completion framework leverages depth foundation models for robustness without large-scale training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth completion models degrade in out-of-distribution scenarios due to reliance on limited data. Foundation models offer robustness potential.

Method: Uses a depth foundation model for environmental cues, dual-space propagation (3D/2D), and a learnable correction module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 16 datasets, excelling in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework achieves robust depth completion without extensive training, validated by superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified modality separation framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using vision-language models (VLMs) to address the modality gap, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct UDA with VLMs transfers only modality-invariant knowledge due to the modality gap, limiting target performance.

Method: A framework disentangles modality-specific and invariant components from VLM features, uses modality-adaptive ensemble weights, and categorizes samples via a modality discrepancy metric.

Result: Achieves up to 9% performance gain with 9x computational efficiency across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the modality gap, enhancing UDA performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

*Yue Li,Weifan Wang,Tai Sing Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how familiarity training in a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder induces global context sensitivity in early layers, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fast weights. Results show manifold transformation, alignment of latent representations, broader self-attention scope, and amplified effects with LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how rapid learning of global image context in early visual cortex can be modeled in deep neural networks, focusing on fast weights and recurrent interactions.

Method: A ViT-based autoencoder with LoRA for fast weights is used to simulate familiarity training, analyzing self-attention circuits and latent representations.

Result: Familiarity training aligns early and top layer representations, broadens self-attention scope, and enhances effects with LoRA, mimicking neural circuit behavior.

Conclusion: Familiarity training introduces global sensitivity in hierarchical networks, and hybrid fast-slow weight architectures may model rapid context learning in the brain.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-ReID improves occluded Re-ID by leveraging fine-grained attributes without extra data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained vision-language models struggle with occluded Re-ID due to neglect of fine-grained attributes.

Method: AG-ReID uses a two-stage process: attribute pseudo-label generation and dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained features.

Result: AG-ReID achieves top performance on Re-ID datasets, excelling in occluded scenarios and subtle attribute differences.

Conclusion: AG-ReID effectively addresses occluded Re-ID challenges by integrating fine-grained attributes, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CRAM, a method for video continual learning using compressed vision and rehearsal-based training to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable neural networks to learn continuously from video streams without large storage, mimicking biological learning and handling natural distribution shifts.

Method: Uses compressed vision (video codes instead of raw data) and a rehearsal buffer. Addresses forgetting by refreshing video codes with careful decompression and recompression.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on large-scale benchmarks (EpicKitchens-100, Kinetics-700) with under 2 GB memory usage.

Conclusion: CRAM effectively reduces memory requirements for video continual learning while maintaining performance, advancing practical deployment.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDRL integrates causal inference with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to improve domain generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing domain-specific variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images have high variability and domain shifts due to confounders like equipment differences, leading to poor generalization of VLMs in medical tasks.

Method: MCDRL uses CLIP to identify lesion regions and build a confounder dictionary via text prompts, then trains a causal intervention network to eliminate domain-specific variations while preserving anatomical details.

Result: MCDRL outperforms other methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robust generalization.

Conclusion: MCDRL effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in medical imaging by combining causal inference with VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Motivation: The lack of specialized quality assessment models for AI-enhanced UGC limits user experience and advancement of enhancement methods.

Method: Constructed AU-IQA dataset with 4,800 AI-UGC images from three enhancement types (super-resolution, low-light, denoising) and evaluated existing quality assessment models.

Result: Evaluated traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models on the AU-IQA dataset.

Conclusion: Provides insights into the effectiveness of current approaches for assessing AI-UGC quality, with the dataset available for further research.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is a major global health issue with high costs. Manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.

Method: Proposes skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes. Introduces MedConceptEval and CCS metrics for clinical relevance.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro in clinical relevance metrics.

Conclusion: skin-SOAP offers scalable, clinically grounded documentation, reducing manual effort and the need for large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCSSIM, a novel metric for evaluating image quality in generative AI by focusing on Scene Composition Structure (SCS) preservation, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image quality metrics fail to adequately assess the structural integrity of scene compositions in generative AI outputs, necessitating a new approach.

Method: SCSSIM is a training-free, analytical metric that uses Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning and statistical measures to quantify SCS preservation.

Result: SCSSIM shows high invariance to non-compositional distortions and a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, accurately reflecting SCS changes.

Conclusion: SCSSIM is a superior tool for evaluating generative models, ensuring scene composition integrity without the drawbacks of existing metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

TL;DR: Proposes HAMoBE, a Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts framework for video-based person ReID, improving performance by +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of discriminative feature selection in existing video-based ReID methods by mimicking human perceptual mechanisms.

Method: Uses a two-level framework: extracts low-level features from a pre-trained model (e.g., CLIP) and employs specialized experts for appearance, body shape, and gait, dynamically adjusted by a dual-input gating network.

Result: Achieves significant improvements, e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy on MEVID benchmarks.

Conclusion: HAMoBE effectively enhances video-based ReID by adaptively integrating discriminative features.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Result: Experiments show Spot-IT significantly improves MLLMs' performance in precise detail extraction from complex layouts, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in fine-grained tasks and demonstrates the effectiveness of Spot-IT in addressing these challenges.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

*Yifeng Huang,Zhang Chen,Yi Xu,Minh Hoai,Zhong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualMat is a dual-path diffusion framework for PBR material estimation from single images, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating PBR materials from single images under complex lighting conditions, leveraging dual latent spaces for better accuracy.

Method: Uses two latent paths: albedo-optimized (RGB space) and material-specialized (compact space), with feature distillation and rectified flow for efficiency. Extends to high-resolution/multi-view via patch-based estimation and cross-view attention.

Result: Achieves up to 28% better albedo estimation and 39% reduction in metallic-roughness errors, outperforming existing methods on Objaverse and real-world data.

Conclusion: DualMat is a highly effective framework for PBR material estimation, offering significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS is a two-stage framework for Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) that decouples class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, improving retention-plasticity balance and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSS methods suffer from interference between old and new class learning due to tightly coupled segmentation masks and class labels in single-stage architectures.

Method: DecoupleCSS uses a two-stage approach: (1) class-aware detection with pre-trained encoders and LoRA adaptation, and (2) class-agnostic segmentation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: The framework achieves better retention-plasticity balance and state-of-the-art performance in CSS tasks.

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in CSS by decoupling detection and segmentation, enabling efficient continual learning.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

*Ruiyu Li,Changyuan Qiu,Hangrui Cao,Qihan Ren,Yuqing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task by leveraging scene semantics and texture cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image colorization is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, but scene semantics and texture provide useful color cues. The goal is to improve colorization by moving beyond regression to classification and adversarial learning.

Method: The approach involves building models based on prior works, applying modifications for specific scenarios, and comparing results. Classification and adversarial learning are key techniques.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the focus is on improving colorization by leveraging multi-modal color prediction.

Conclusion: The paper aims to advance image colorization by combining classification and adversarial learning, addressing limitations of regression-based methods.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup is a novel makeup transfer framework that eliminates auxiliary face-control components, leveraging source-reference pairs and a lightweight injector for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods rely on auxiliary components, introducing errors and suboptimal results. FLUX-Makeup aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: FLUX-Makeup uses FLUX-Kontext with source images as conditional input and introduces RefLoRAInjector for efficient makeup feature extraction. A robust data generation pipeline enhances training supervision.

Result: FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing datasets.

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup provides a high-fidelity, identity-consistent, and robust solution for makeup transfer without auxiliary components.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaFusion is a prompt-guided framework that dynamically integrates multiple pathology foundation models (PFMs) to enhance performance and interpretability in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs have latent biases from diverse pretraining contexts, limiting generalisability and transparency in applications.

Method: AdaFusion compresses and aligns tile-level features from multiple PFMs, using a lightweight attention mechanism for adaptive fusion based on tissue phenotype context.

Result: AdaFusion outperforms individual PFMs in classification and regression tasks across three benchmarks, providing interpretable insights into model specialisation.

Conclusion: AdaFusion effectively bridges heterogeneous PFMs, improving performance and interpretability of model biases.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

*Jingxuan He,Busheng Su,Finn Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGen is a novel framework for generating long, coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion, using in-context LoRA finetuning and interleaved segment generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with identity drift and short video clips, limiting their practical use for long, controlled video generation.

Method: PoseGen uses in-context LoRA finetuning for identity preservation and pose conditioning, along with an interleaved segment generation method for unlimited video length.

Result: PoseGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and produces artifact-free, unlimited-duration videos.

Conclusion: PoseGen addresses key challenges in video generation, offering superior performance in identity and motion control for long videos.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

*Liang Bai,Hong Song,Jinfu Li,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Tianyu Fu,Danni Ai,Deqiang Xiao,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty) is a novel method for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that balances base-class discriminability and new-class generalization using margin penalties and adaptive merging of low-rank adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in class-incremental learning due to data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs, aiming to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization.

Method: Proposes SMP with Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) for base task learning and Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) for incremental tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200, balancing base and new classes effectively.

Conclusion: SMP effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by integrating margin penalties and adaptive merging, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation MIL framework, reduces inference costs in pathological image classification by filtering irrelevant patches via a two-step training process, achieving faster and more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs in MIL due to processing thousands of patches from gigapixel WSIs.

Method: Two-step training: self-distillation (SD) for WSI classification and asymmetric distillation (AD) to predict patch relevance. Uses DMIN and DB-LIPN networks. Introduces a CKA classifier.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, e.g., 5.3% accuracy improvement on Camelyon16 and 1.2x faster inference. Consistent gains in AUC, accuracy, F1, and Brier scores.

Conclusion: AHDMIL offers a scalable solution for efficient and accurate pathological image classification.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual grounding framework improves object localization by generating multiple latent expressions from a single textual input, incorporating complementary visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse textual cues, leading to misidentification of similar objects due to the mismatch with rich visual details.

Method: The framework uses subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts, along with positive-margin contrastive learning for alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches and excels in the GRES benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between textual and visual domains, enhancing object localization accuracy.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

TL;DR: FedGIN is a Federated Learning framework for multimodal medical image segmentation, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues with a GIN augmentation module. It improves performance across MRI and CT modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model for accurate medical image segmentation across diverse modalities without sharing raw data, overcoming challenges like domain shift and data scarcity.

Method: Proposes FedGIN, integrating a GIN augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions in Federated Learning, tested on imputed and complete datasets.

Result: FedGIN improved 3D Dice scores by 12-18% in limited-data scenarios and achieved near-centralized performance in complete datasets, with 30% and 10% improvements over MRI-only and CT-only baselines.

Conclusion: FedGIN effectively generalizes across modalities under privacy constraints, enhancing segmentation accuracy and clinical workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for automatically discovering chronic pain-related features in mice, outperforming human experts and existing methods in classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manual labeling and lack clarity on behaviors representing chronic pain, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: Uses a universal action space projector to extract mouse action features automatically, avoiding human bias.

Result: Achieves 48.41% accuracy in 15-class pain classification and 73.1% in simplified 3-class classification, outperforming human experts and B-SOiD.

Conclusion: Demonstrates clinical potential for pain research and drug development, providing new insights.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rotation-equivariant ASISR method to improve high-resolution image recovery by maintaining geometric patterns' integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common geometric patterns in low-resolution images are often warped, leading to artifacts in high-resolution recoveries. Rotation equivariance is needed to preserve orientations and structural integrity.

Method: The authors redesign the INR and encoder modules to incorporate rotation equivariance, enabling end-to-end equivariance from input to output. Theoretical analysis evaluates intrinsic equivariance error.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate the method's superiority. The framework can be integrated into existing ASISR methods to enhance performance.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation-equivariant ASISR method effectively maintains geometric integrity and can be easily integrated into current methods.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: X-MoGen is a unified framework for cross-species text-driven motion generation, addressing morphological differences between humans and animals with a two-stage architecture and a novel dataset, UniMo4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human and animal motion separately, limiting generalization. A joint approach can unify representation and improve plausibility.

Method: X-MoGen uses a two-stage process: a conditional graph variational autoencoder for T-pose priors and motion encoding, followed by masked motion modeling for text-conditioned generation. A morphological consistency module ensures skeletal plausibility.

Result: X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UniMo4D dataset, covering 115 species and 119k motion sequences, for both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: X-MoGen successfully addresses cross-species motion generation challenges, offering a unified and scalable solution with improved performance.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, and existing methods perform poorly on MLLM-based systems due to their complex architectures.

Method: PhysPatch uses semantic-based mask initialization, SVD-based local alignment loss, and potential field-based mask refinement to optimize patches.

Result: PhysPatch outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned outputs and ensures physically feasible patch placement.

Conclusion: PhysPatch enhances attack effectiveness and real-world deployability for adversarial patches in MLLM-based AD systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

### [45] [Multi-tracklet Tracking for Generic Targets with Adaptive Detection Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05172)
*Zewei Wu,Longhao Wang,Cui Wang,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) to address challenges in tracking unseen categories by integrating adaptive tracklet generation and multi-tracklet association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen categories due to low-confidence detections, weak constraints, and occlusions.

Method: MTT clusters detections into tracklets using spatio-temporal correlation, then uses location and appearance clues for association.

Result: Demonstrates competitiveness on generic multiple object tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: MTT effectively mitigates error propagation and improves tracking robustness.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

### [46] [SPA++: Generalized Graph Spectral Alignment for Versatile Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05182)
*Zhiqing Xiao,Haobo Wang,Xu Lu,Wentao Ye,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPA++ is a graph spectral alignment framework for domain adaptation, improving transferability and discriminability by aligning domain graphs in eigenspaces and using neighbor-aware propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior domain adaptation methods overlook intra-domain structures, leading to poor discriminability. SPA++ addresses this tradeoff.

Method: SPA++ combines coarse graph alignment, spectral regularization, neighbor-aware propagation, data augmentation, and consistency regularization.

Result: SPA++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing robustness and adaptability in various domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPA++ effectively balances transferability and discriminability, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

*Dongchen Si,Di Wang,Erzhong Gao,Xiaolei Qin,Liu Zhao,Jing Zhang,Minqiang Xu,Jianbo Zhan,Jianshe Wang,Lin Liu,Bo Du,Liangpei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEX is a multimodal LLM for land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by leveraging spectral priors and vision-language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models underutilize spectral information, leading to suboptimal performance in multispectral remote sensing.

Method: Constructs the SPIE dataset with spectral priors encoded as textual attributes, and designs SPEX with multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: SPEX outperforms existing methods on five public datasets and provides interpretable textual explanations.

Conclusion: SPEX advances land cover extraction by integrating spectral and textual data, offering improved accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

### [48] [EndoMatcher: Generalizable Endoscopic Image Matcher via Multi-Domain Pre-training for Robot-Assisted Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05205)
*Bingyu Yang,Qingyao Tian,Yimeng Geng,Huai Liao,Xinyan Huang,Jiebo Luo,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoMatcher is a generalizable endoscopic image matcher using multi-domain pre-training and a two-branch Vision Transformer for robust feature matching, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense feature matching in endoscopic images is challenging due to weak textures, viewpoint variations, and lack of annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks and is trained on Endo-Mix6, a multi-domain dataset of 1.2M image pairs. A progressive multi-objective training strategy addresses dataset diversity and stability.

Result: EndoMatcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on Hamlyn and Bladder datasets, and improving MDPA by 9.40% on Gastro-Matching.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher generalizes well to unseen organs and conditions, providing dense and accurate matching in challenging endoscopic scenarios.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

### [49] [VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211)
*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFlowOpt is a token pruning framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that reduces computational costs by pruning 90% of visual tokens while maintaining performance, cutting KV-Cache memory by 89% and speeding up inference by 3.8x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods in LMMs are simplistic, leading to performance degradation. VFlowOpt addresses this by optimizing pruning strategies to retain critical visual information.

Method: VFlowOpt derives importance maps based on attention-derived context relevance and patch-level entropy, progressively prunes tokens with a recycling mechanism, and optimizes pruning hyperparameters using visual information flow.

Result: The framework prunes 90% of visual tokens with minimal performance loss, reducing KV-Cache memory by 89% and accelerating inference by 3.8 times.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt offers an efficient and effective token pruning solution for LMMs, balancing computational savings with performance retention.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### [50] [Textual and Visual Guided Task Adaptation for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05213)
*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a source-free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) method using textual and visual information to adapt to target domains without source data, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Few-Shot Segmentation due to domain discrepancies and privacy/data transfer concerns.

Method: Leverages Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) and alignment modules (VVEA, TVEA) for cross-domain adaptation without source data.

Result: Achieves 2.18% (1-shot) and 4.11% (5-shot) accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts to target domains without source data, outperforming existing CD-FSS approaches.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

*Xiao Wang,Liye Jin,Xufeng Lou,Shiao Wang,Lan Chen,Bo Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework using Qwen2.5-VL, optimized with SFT and GRPO, and validated on a new dataset TNLLT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods lack flexibility and reasoning insights, limiting performance. The paper aims to improve this by leveraging large models and reasoning-based strategies.

Method: Proposes ReasoningTrack, embedding updated language descriptions with vision features in a unified backbone, optimized via SFT and GRPO, and evaluated on TNLLT dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the reasoning-based natural language generation strategy.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack advances vision-language tracking by integrating reasoning and large models, supported by a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM v2.1) effectively segments irregular gas bubbles in multiphase flows using minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and learning-based methods fail to segment deformed or coalesced bubbles, a critical challenge in industrial applications like air lubrication systems.

Method: The study frames bubble segmentation as a transfer learning problem, fine-tuning SAM v2.1 with just 100 annotated images.

Result: SAM v2.1 accurately segments non-convex, irregular bubble structures despite minimal training data.

Conclusion: Modern vision foundation models like SAM v2.1 offer a promising solution for complex bubble segmentation tasks in industrial settings.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen is a diffusion-based framework for generating controllable camera images from arbitrary viewpoints, using Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL) to address the lack of ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating high-fidelity images from arbitrary viewpoints in autonomous driving due to missing ground-truth data for extrapolated views.

Method: Proposes FAVS for hierarchical feature matching and CVC-SSL for self-supervised training using a diffusion model to enforce cross-view consistency.

Result: Arbiviewgen generates controllable arbitrary view images without needing additional sensors or depth maps, applicable to multiple vehicle configurations.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen is the first method for controllable arbitrary view camera image generation, leveraging self-supervised learning and feature-aware stitching.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing adversarial robustness with zero-shot generalization in vision-language models.

Method: Analyzed two defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT) and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, tracking evolution from alignment-preserving methods to latent-space purification.

Result: Identified key defense strategies and their evolution, highlighting the effectiveness of methods like TeCoA, LAAT, TIMA, AOM, TTC, and CLIPure.

Conclusion: Future directions include hybrid defense strategies and adversarial pre-training to further enhance robustness without compromising generalization.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and

TL;DR: RegionMed-CLIP is a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework for medical image understanding, addressing data scarcity and overreliance on global features by integrating localized pathological signals and holistic semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of limited annotated medical data and reliance on global image features, which miss subtle pathological regions, motivate the need for a region-aware approach.

Method: Introduces RegionMed-CLIP with an ROI processor for fine-grained regional features and progressive training. Uses MedRegion-500k, a large annotated medical image-text corpus.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive pre-training is critical, and RegionMed-CLIP serves as a robust foundation for multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

TL;DR: The paper reviews gender classification methods, focusing on facial and iris-based approaches, and highlights gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is useful in applications like surveillance and human-computer interaction, leveraging soft biometrics like facial and iris features.

Method: The study reviews existing literature and methodologies for gender classification, emphasizing facial and iris-based techniques.

Result: The paper provides an analysis of current approaches, identifies gaps, and suggests future improvements.

Conclusion: The study serves as a resource for researchers, highlighting challenges and proposing future paths in gender classification.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CF3, a top-down pipeline for creating compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, improving efficiency by reducing computational costs and preserving geometric details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods rely on bottom-up optimization, treating raw 2D features as ground truth, which increases computational costs. The goal is to develop a more efficient approach.

Method: The proposed CF3 method involves a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians, training a per-Gaussian autoencoder on lifted features, and adaptive sparsification to optimize Gaussian attributes while pruning redundant Gaussians.

Result: CF3 achieves a competitive 3D feature field using only 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS, maintaining efficiency and preserving geometric details.

Conclusion: The CF3 pipeline offers a more efficient and compact solution for 3D Gaussian feature fields, reducing computational costs while retaining accuracy and detail.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks is proposed for robust real-time tracking of cardiac features during bypass surgery, outperforming deep learning and conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods struggle with heart motion and image fluctuations during coronary bypass grafting surgery.

Method: Uses a particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks to track 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps.

Result: Achieves a tracking error of 5.00 +/- 0.22 px, better than deep learning (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Conclusion: The proposed method enables real-time, accurate tracking for cardiac perfusion estimation during surgery.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional

### [59] [SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Zhen Hua,Yakun Ju,Wei Zhou,Jun Liu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by SAM, enhances infrared and visible image fusion by leveraging semantic masks for high-fidelity, semantically-aware results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods lack deep semantic understanding, leading to key target loss and artifacts. SGDFuse addresses this by integrating semantic guidance.

Method: Uses SAM-generated semantic masks as priors in a two-stage process: preliminary fusion followed by diffusion-based refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in subjective/objective evaluations and downstream task adaptability.

Conclusion: SGDFuse effectively solves core challenges in image fusion with high fidelity and semantic awareness.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

*Changho Choi,Youngwoo Shin,Gyojin Han,Dong-Jae Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces B4DL, a benchmark for training and evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on 4D LiDAR data, addressing the lack of high-quality annotations and suitable architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D LiDAR point clouds are underutilized in MLLMs due to missing annotations and processing capabilities, despite their potential for dynamic outdoor scene understanding.

Method: Proposes B4DL benchmark, a scalable data generation pipeline, and an MLLM model that processes raw 4D LiDAR data for spatio-temporal reasoning.

Result: The model and benchmark provide a unified solution for 4D LiDAR understanding, with rendered videos, datasets, and inference outputs available.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between 4D LiDAR and language understanding, enabling better dynamic outdoor environment analysis.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated
dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at:

### [61] [Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05271)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF) for remote sensing change detection, leveraging frequency-domain features to enhance edge and fine-grained change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on spatial-domain modeling, limiting feature diversity and hindering detection of subtle changes. Frequency-domain features, especially in the wavelet domain, can better capture fine-grained differences.

Method: WGDF uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components. High-frequency features are enhanced with a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE) module, while low-frequency features use Transformers and a Progressive Contextual Difference Module (PCDM).

Result: WGDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing edge ambiguity and improving detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain modeling, particularly wavelet-guided approaches, significantly enhances change detection in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

*Meiqi Wu,Yaxuan Kang,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu,Xiaotang Chen,Yunfeng Kang,Weiqiang Wang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method (VS-LLM) for analyzing PPAT sketches in art therapy to assess depression, improving accuracy by 17.6% over traditional psychologist evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual interpretation of PPAT sketches in art therapy is labor-intensive and subjective, necessitating an automated solution for large-scale mental state assessment.

Method: The VS-LLM method combines visual and semantic analysis using LLM to evaluate PPAT sketches, focusing on color usage and space utilization despite low drawing accuracy.

Result: The proposed method outperforms psychologist assessments by 17.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness in depression evaluation.

Conclusion: The VS-LLM method offers a scalable and accurate alternative for mental state assessment using PPAT sketches, with potential for broader applications in art therapy.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

### [63] [CoCAViT: Compact Vision Transformer with Robust Global Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05307)
*Xuyang Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCAViT addresses the generalization gap in smaller models by introducing Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA), enhancing robustness and performance on OOD data with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller models show disproportionate performance drops on OOD data, indicating poor generalization. The paper aims to improve robustness in efficient architectures.

Method: Identifies architectural bottlenecks, introduces CoCA for dynamic global-local feature modeling, and presents CoCAViT as a robust visual backbone.

Result: CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with gains on OOD benchmarks, 52.2 mAP on COCO, and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K, maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: CoCAViT effectively bridges the generalization gap in smaller models, offering robust performance across domains with efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes mKG-RAG, a multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework, to enhance RAG-based VQA by integrating structured multimodal knowledge graphs, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RAG-based VQA methods often introduce irrelevant content due to unstructured documents, reducing answer accuracy. Structured multimodal KGs are seen as a solution.

Method: The framework uses MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to build multimodal KGs, along with a dual-stage retrieval strategy for efficient and precise knowledge retrieval.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-based VQA tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal KGs into RAG frameworks significantly improves VQA accuracy and reliability, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured knowledge.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

### [65] [Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323)
*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Textual Inversion (TI) method for open-vocabulary object detection in VLMs, enabling vocabulary extension with minimal data while retaining zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities in VLMs during fine-tuning, while improving detection of novel or fine-grained objects.

Method: Uses Textual Inversion to learn new or improve existing tokens from few examples, keeping the original VLM weights frozen.

Result: The method retains original benchmark performance and zero-shot capabilities, outperforming baselines that suffer from forgetting.

Conclusion: TI is a compute-efficient solution for extending VLM vocabularies without compromising existing capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGabSplat improves 3DGS by using 3D Gabor-based primitives for better high-frequency detail capture, efficiency, and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with high-frequency details, redundant primitives, and inefficiency. 3DGabSplat addresses these issues.

Method: Uses 3D Gabor-based primitives with multi-directional frequency responses and a CUDA-based rasterizer for rendering.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS with 1.35 dB PSNR gain, fewer primitives, and lower memory use.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat is a scalable, efficient, and high-quality solution for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

*Kang Liu,Zhuoqi Ma,Zikang Fang,Yunan Li,Kun Xie,Qiguang Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG is a chest X-ray report generation framework that integrates patient-specific prior knowledge, improving diagnostic accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect patient-specific prior knowledge (e.g., clinical context, prior images), which is crucial for accurate diagnostic reasoning.

Method: PriorRG uses a two-stage pipeline: (1) prior-guided contrastive pre-training for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and (2) prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding to integrate prior knowledge with vision encoder outputs.

Result: PriorRG achieves significant improvements (e.g., 3.6% BLEU-4, 3.8% F1 on MIMIC-CXR; 5.9% BLEU-1 on MIMIC-ABN) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PriorRG effectively emulates clinical workflows by leveraging prior knowledge, enhancing report accuracy and fluency.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc improves cross-view localization by dividing ground-level images into sub-images for redundant pose estimation, filtering errors, and validating reliability, achieving higher accuracy and failure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVL methods lack redundant observations for reliability assessment, making it hard to validate localization accuracy.

Method: Slice-Loc divides query images into sub-images, estimates 3-DoF poses for each, filters errors using geometric rigidity, and merges inliers for the final pose. It also quantifies meaningfulness via false alarm estimation.

Result: Slice-Loc reduces errors exceeding 10m to under 3%, cuts mean localization error from 4.47m to 1.86m, and orientation error from 3.42° to 1.24° in cross-city tests.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc enhances CVL accuracy and reliability by introducing redundant observations and rigorous validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH is a hierarchical graph attention network for automating radiology report generation by modeling fine-grained organ relationships and integrating them into a large language model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.9% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating radiology report generation to assist radiologists with heavy workloads, addressing the limitation of current methods that fail to capture fine-grained organ relationships.

Method: Uses a hierarchical graph attention network (CT-GRAPH) to structure anatomical regions into a graph, leveraging pretrained 3D medical feature encoders and integrating features into a large language model for report generation.

Result: Achieves a 7.9% absolute improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods on the CT-RATE dataset.

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH effectively models radiological knowledge and improves report generation accuracy, with publicly available code for further use.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework with deformable attention improves pathology image classification by dynamically capturing spatial dependencies among tissue patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MIL and static GNNs fail to adequately model spatial relationships and lack specificity in attention mechanisms for pathology images.

Method: Proposes a dynamic weighted directed GNN with deformable attention, incorporating learnable spatial offsets based on patch coordinates to adaptively focus on relevant regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior spatial structure capture.

Conclusion: The deformable attention GNN effectively enhances contextual understanding while preserving spatial specificity in pathology image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

*Wonjun Kang,Byeongkeun Ahn,Minjae Lee,Kevin Galim,Seunghyuk Oh,Hyung Il Koo,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNCAGE improves compositional text-to-image generation by using contrastive attention guidance to prioritize unmasking tokens representing objects, enhancing fidelity without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Diffusion Models and Masked Generative Transformers struggle with accurate attribute binding and text-image alignment in compositional T2I generation.

Method: Proposes UNCAGE, a training-free method leveraging attention maps to focus on tokens representing individual objects during unmasking.

Result: UNCAGE enhances performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluations across benchmarks with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE effectively addresses compositional fidelity challenges in T2I generation, offering a practical solution with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TrueBiometric detects and corrects backdoor-poisoned images in biometric systems with 100% accuracy using majority voting and corrective noise, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, compromising security. Existing defenses struggle to identify and mitigate poisoned images without affecting data utility.

Method: TrueBiometric uses majority voting with multiple vision-language models to detect poisoned images and applies targeted corrective noise to fix them.

Result: The method achieves 100% accuracy in detecting and correcting poisoned images without reducing accuracy on clean data.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric provides a practical, accurate, and effective solution for securing biometric systems against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

*Jiawei Liang,Siyuan Liang,Jianjie Huang,Chenxi Si,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adversarial camouflage framework improves attack success rates on deep object detectors by addressing gradient optimization challenges in variable physical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical adversarial camouflage poses security risks in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving, but existing methods struggle with environmental variability.

Method: Proposes gradient calibration for consistent updates and gradient decorrelation to stabilize multi-angle optimization.

Result: Achieves 13.46% higher ASR across distances and 11.03% across angles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances attack effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust detector designs.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothSA improves Slot Attention (SA) by preheating cold-start queries and differentiating transforms for first and non-first video frames, enhancing object-centric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start queries in SA lack sample-specific cues, hindering precise aggregation, and non-first frames require different transforms than the first frame.

Method: SmoothSA preheats queries with input features via self-distillation and uses full/single iterations for first/non-first frames.

Result: Validated on object discovery, recognition, and benchmarks, SmoothSA shows effectiveness and intuitive improvements.

Conclusion: SmoothSA addresses SA's limitations, smoothing iterations and recurrences for better performance.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

*Hubert Baniecki,Maximilian Muschalik,Fabian Fumagalli,Barbara Hammer,Eyke Hüllermeier,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIxLIP introduces a game theory-based method for explaining vision-language models, outperforming first-order methods by capturing cross-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps in language-image pre-training (LIP) models miss complex cross-modal interactions, limiting explanation quality.

Method: FIxLIP uses the weighted Banzhaf interaction index from game theory to decompose similarity in vision-language encoders, improving flexibility and efficiency.

Result: FIxLIP outperforms first-order methods on benchmarks like MS COCO and ImageNet-1k and aids in model comparison (e.g., CLIP vs. SigLIP-2).

Conclusion: FIxLIP provides superior second-order interaction explanations, enhancing understanding and evaluation of vision-language models.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

### [76] [How and Why: Taming Flow Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05461)
*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new unsupervised anomaly detection method using Flow Matching (FM) with time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) interpolation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses expressivity limitations of conventional flow-based methods for anomaly detection.

Method: Introduces rFM for transforming data into Gaussian distributions and WT-Flow for non-probabilistic paths to separate anomalies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec dataset.

Conclusion: FM provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset (PAS) for pituitary anatomy segmentation and proposes F2PASeg, a method to improve segmentation robustness in surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pituitary tumors deform adjacent structures, risking surgery. Segmentation can enhance safety, but annotated datasets are rare.

Method: PAS dataset with 7,845 images from 120 videos is created. Data augmentation and Feature Fusion module (F2PASeg) address class imbalance and feature inconsistency.

Result: F2PASeg segments critical structures in real time, handling occlusions and variations.

Conclusion: F2PASeg provides a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lossy image compression can defend against adversarial attacks, but realistic reconstructions increase attack difficulty. High-fidelity compression models resist attacks better than low-realism ones, due to distributional alignment, not gradient masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of lossy image compression in defending against adversarial attacks and understand why realistic reconstructions are harder to attack.

Method: Constructed strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models, comparing high-realism and low-realism reconstructions.

Result: High-fidelity compression models resist attacks better; realism and distributional alignment with natural images provide inherent robustness.

Conclusion: Realistic reconstructions pose a significant challenge for adversarial attacks, suggesting future security evaluations must address overcoming realism.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OND knowledge-based prompting to improve segmentation of historical maps using foundation models, outperforming UNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack consistency in patterns and styles, making it hard for pre-trained foundation models to perform well.

Method: Proposes OND prompting to guide models with explicit prompts, replacing SAM's prompt encoder and fine-tuning on historical maps.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg accurately segments classes defined by OND knowledge and adapts to unseen classes with few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OND prompting enhances segmentation of historical maps, offering flexibility and better performance than UNet.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-resource languages, proposing a dual-source strategy (cultural groundedness and linguistic capability) and introducing the MELLA dataset to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to reliance on text-only methods or machine translation, lacking multimodal and cultural awareness.

Method: A dual-source strategy is proposed: native web alt-text for cultural groundedness and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability, implemented via the MELLA dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA improves performance across eight languages, yielding "thick descriptions" and verifying gains from both cultural and linguistic enhancements.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic enhancements in MLLMs for low-resource languages, with MELLA serving as a practical solution.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

TL;DR: AutoIAD is a multi-agent framework for automated industrial anomaly detection, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual anomaly detection in manufacturing is labor-intensive. AutoIAD aims to automate this process for better efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Uses a Manager-Driven central agent to coordinate specialized sub-agents (Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and a domain-specific knowledge base.

Result: Outperforms general-purpose agentic collaboration and AutoML frameworks in task completion rate and model performance (AUROC).

Conclusion: AutoIAD is effective for industrial anomaly detection, with the Manager agent and knowledge base being key to its success.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

### [82] [Symmetry Understanding of 3D Shapes via Chirality Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05505)
*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline for shape analysis, addressing the lack of chirality-aware features in current descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chirality information is crucial but underdeveloped in shape analysis (e.g., point clouds, meshes), and existing descriptors often fail to distinguish left-right symmetry.

Method: The authors leverage the Diff3F framework to create a chirality feature extractor, using 2D foundation models to decorate shape vertices with chirality-aware information.

Result: The extracted features were evaluated on tasks like left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation, showing effectiveness and practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses the gap in chirality-aware shape descriptors, demonstrating its value in diverse applications.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI improves hand-object reconstruction from monocular videos by using novel view synthesis diffusion models as supervision for unseen object regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object templates or assume full visibility, leading to implausible reconstructions in real-world settings with limited viewpoints.

Method: MagicHOI integrates a novel view synthesis model and visible contact constraints to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions.

Result: MagicHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively regularizes unseen object regions.

Conclusion: Novel view synthesis diffusion priors enhance 3D hand-object reconstruction, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework for event cameras enhances feature extraction from sparse, noisy event data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in tasks like object recognition and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and dynamic range but produce sparse, noisy data, complicating feature extraction.

Method: The framework includes Difference-guided Masked Modeling, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning to extract and refine event data features.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks like object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages event data for robust visual representation, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

### [85] [Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514)
*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced pedestrian tracking framework addresses occlusion challenges by integrating richer feature representations, head keypoint detection, and an iterative Kalman filter for robust motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pedestrian tracking faces occlusion issues, especially in crowded scenes, where traditional methods relying on full-body features and linear motion assumptions fail.

Method: The framework combines detection features from regression and classification branches, uses head keypoints for occlusion resilience, and employs an iterative Kalman filter with 3D priors for motion modeling.

Result: The method improves tracking stability and accuracy in occlusion-heavy environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances multi-object tracking in crowded scenes by addressing occlusion challenges through advanced feature and motion modeling.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A certified defense method for IQA models using randomized smoothing in feature space, preserving image quality while ensuring robustness. It reduces inference time and improves correlation with subjective scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods degrade image quality by injecting noise in input space. This work aims to preserve fidelity while providing robustness guarantees.

Method: Randomized smoothing in feature space, analyzing the Jacobian's maximum singular value to connect noise levels. Supports FR and NR IQA models without architectural changes.

Result: Reduces inference time by 99.5% (without certification) and 20.6% (with certification). Improves correlation with subjective scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, preserves image quality, and outperforms existing certified defenses in robustness and performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Result: AI assistance improved throughput by 6.03-fold, reduced errors from 54.67% to 8.48%, and lowered false positives by 15.48-fold.

Conclusion: AI-assisted approaches can transform clinical trial workflows, speeding drug development while ensuring compliance.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimal Brain Connection, a structural pruning framework that evaluates parameter saliency with the Jacobian Criterion and mitigates performance loss via Equivalent Pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods overlook parameter interconnections, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes the Jacobian Criterion for parameter saliency and Equivalent Pruning to retain contributions of pruned connections.

Result: Jacobian Criterion outperforms other metrics, and Equivalent Pruning reduces performance degradation.

Conclusion: The framework improves pruning effectiveness by addressing parameter interconnections and maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

*Haoyu Liu,Chaoyu Gong,Mengke He,Jiate Li,Kai Han,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSTGNN is a lightweight graph neural network framework for detecting AI-generated videos, outperforming state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AI-generated videos is challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in generalizing across manipulation types and their reliance on large models.

Method: SSTGNN uses a graph-based architecture with learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling to capture spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies.

Result: SSTGNN achieves superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain settings, with robustness against unseen manipulations, using up to 42.4× fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SSTGNN is a scalable, lightweight solution for real-world deployment in detecting manipulated videos.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

*Adi Levi,Or Levi,Sardhendu Mishra,Jonathan Morra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for brand safety classification in content moderation, introduces a new dataset, and evaluates their accuracy and cost efficiency compared to human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of online video content has made human moderation insufficient, necessitating automated solutions for nuanced multimodal understanding.

Method: The study introduces a novel multimodal and multilingual dataset, labeled by professionals, and evaluates MLLMs (Gemini, GPT, Llama) for brand safety classification.

Result: MLLMs show effectiveness in brand safety moderation but have limitations and failure cases, as discussed.

Conclusion: The paper highlights MLLMs' potential for content moderation, releases the dataset for future research, and calls for addressing their limitations.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Action Discovery addresses ambiguous and incomplete action annotations in partially labeled datasets by identifying unknown actions alongside known ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from ambiguous actions and incomplete annotations in datasets, especially in neuroscience and other domains with subtle or infrequent actions.

Method: A two-step approach: Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) for temporal intervals and Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) for semantic classes.

Result: The method outperforms baselines on datasets like Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly.

Conclusion: Action Discovery effectively handles partial annotations and improves action segmentation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called Follow-Your-Instruction uses MLLMs to automate high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data synthesis, addressing scalability and accuracy issues in AI-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and effort of collecting real-world data for AI-generated content limit scalability and accuracy, prompting the need for automated solutions.

Method: The framework uses MLLMs to collect assets, construct 3D layouts, refine semantics with VLMs, and generate temporally coherent frames.

Result: Synthetic data from the framework improves baseline model performance in 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction is a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

*Haijing Liu,Tao Pu,Hefeng Wu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART framework enhances VLP models for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition by combining adaptive intra-class refinement and inter-class transfer using LLM-derived knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP models lack fine-grained localization and structured relational knowledge, limiting performance in OV-MLR tasks.

Method: DART introduces two modules: ARM for intra-class refinement with WPS loss, and ATM for inter-class transfer using a CRG derived from LLM.

Result: DART achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART effectively integrates LLM-derived knowledge and adaptive refinement for superior OV-MLR performance.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

*Shaobin Zhuang,Yiwei Guo,Canmiao Fu,Zhipeng Huang,Zeyue Tian,Ying Zhang,Chen Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeTok tokenizer improves vision generation with Group-wise Quantization and Generative Decoding, outperforming existing methods in fidelity and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers struggle with balancing compression and reconstruction fidelity, prompting the need for an improved solution.

Method: Introduces Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ) for efficient memory use and Generative Decoding (GD) for probabilistic modeling of visual data.

Result: Achieves record-low zero-shot rFID (0.12) and superior compression (768x) with high fidelity.

Conclusion: WeTok sets a new standard for visual tokenizers, excelling in both compression and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

TL;DR: LLaVA-RE is a multimodal framework using MLLMs for binary image-text relevancy evaluation, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating image-text relevancy is challenging due to diverse text formats and varying definitions of relevancy. MLLMs are ideal for this task due to their flexibility.

Method: LLaVA-RE, based on the LLaVA architecture, uses detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. A novel binary relevancy dataset is also introduced.

Result: Experimental results confirm the framework's effectiveness in evaluating image-text relevancy.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE successfully addresses the challenge of binary image-text relevancy evaluation using MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-CoT is a unified Chain-of-Thought framework for multimodal reasoning, combining image understanding and generation in a single model with a two-level reasoning paradigm to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CoT reasoning to vision-language tasks is challenging due to difficulties in modeling visual state transitions and fragmented architectures.

Method: Uni-CoT uses a two-level reasoning paradigm (Macro-Level for task planning, Micro-Level for subtask execution) and structured training with interleaved image-text supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (WISE, RISE, KRIS) with efficient training on 8 A100 GPUs.

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is a scalable and coherent solution for multimodal reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

TL;DR: Hi3DEval is a hierarchical framework for evaluating 3D generative content, combining object-level and part-level assessments with material realism. It outperforms image-based metrics and aligns with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D content quality assessment rely on image-based metrics and lack spatial coherence, material authenticity, and local detail capture.

Method: Hi3DEval uses a hierarchical approach with object-level and part-level evaluation, material realism assessment, and a dataset (Hi3DBench) with multi-agent annotations. A 3D-aware automated scoring system employs hybrid 3D representations.

Result: The framework outperforms image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and aligns better with human preferences.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval provides a scalable, holistic alternative to manual evaluations for 3D generative content.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO improve GUI grounding accuracy by leveraging spatial voting and test-time reinforcement learning, achieving 2-3% gains without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods rely on costly pixel-level annotations. The authors aim to exploit implicit confidence signals from spatial overlap patterns for more accurate localization.

Method: GUI-RC uses spatial voting grids from multiple predictions to identify consensus regions. GUI-RCPO transforms these patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning.

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on ScreenSpot benchmarks. GUI-RCPO further boosts performance, e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 83.57% to 85.14%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of test-time scaling and reinforcement learning for robust, data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

TL;DR: MOSEv2 is a challenging dataset for video object segmentation (VOS) designed to address real-world complexities like occlusions, adverse weather, and small objects, showing current methods struggle with such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS datasets focus on salient, isolated objects, limiting generalization to real-world complexities. MOSEv2 aims to bridge this gap.

Method: MOSEv2 introduces 5,024 videos with 701,976 masks, featuring challenges like severe occlusions, adverse weather, and multi-shot sequences.

Result: Benchmarking 20 VOS methods shows performance drops (e.g., SAM2 from 76.4% to 50.9%), highlighting limitations in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MOSEv2 advances VOS research by exposing gaps in current methods and providing a more realistic benchmark.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly

TL;DR: GAP converts colorless 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians using text guidance, multi-view optimization, and surface-anchoring for geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians, especially for colorless point clouds, is an unsolved challenge.

Method: Uses a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, surface-anchoring, and diffuse-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity 3D Gaussians from synthetic and real-world point clouds, including large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: GAP effectively addresses the challenge of generating Gaussians from colorless point clouds with high accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer is a cancelable face generation framework that synthesizes privacy-preserving face images by mixing latent codes, ensuring revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility while maintaining recognition utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in face recognition by developing a method that protects identity while meeting biometric template protection requirements.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained generative model's latent space to mix real face latent codes with synthetic codes from revocable keys, refined via multi-objective loss.

Result: Generates high-quality cancelable faces compatible with existing FR systems, achieving superior recognition accuracy and 11% stronger privacy protection.

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer effectively balances privacy and utility, outperforming recent cancelable biometric methods.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is
available at: https://github.com/talha-alam/faceanonymixer.
