While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions.

We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects.

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a\nSpecialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering\n(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image\nclassifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic\npredictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the\nGeneralist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In\nour framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's\nreasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further\nenhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the\nGeneralist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both\naccuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic\nerrors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on\nour curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an\n18\\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a\nfine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM\nrequirement and latency by at least 20\\% and 5\\%, respectively.
