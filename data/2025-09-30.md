### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS is a behavioral audit that measures VLMs' ability to reject visually contradicted statements, revealing systematic failures in instruction-tuned generative models while contrastive encoders perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for Vision Language Models can hide systematic failures that reduce real-world trust, so there's a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: Introduces MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization) with two metrics: Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR), and uses activation patching to localize failure points.

Result: Instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) show very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are more robust. Activation patching identifies failure loci in cross-attention layers for generative models and pooled projection components for contrastive models.

Conclusion: The audit reveals systematic weaknesses in current VLMs and suggests concrete repair paths through identified failure loci.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation in image alignment with sub-pixel precision using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and cross-correlation maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phase-correlation techniques work well for translational shifts but fail to handle scale and rotation changes that occur due to camera zooming or rotational movements, which are common in real-world applications.

Method: Integrates scale and rotation estimation using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization strategy using the auxiliary function method, incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation.

Result: Experimental results show lower mean estimation errors for both scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based techniques that use discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a highly efficient solution for precise joint estimation of scale and rotation in image alignment with sub-pixel accuracy, outperforming existing Fourier-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization with curriculum learning improves multimodal detection accuracy and robustness in autonomous driving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Proposed reinforcement learning framework augmenting GRPO with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to stabilize optimization under sparse, noisy rewards.

Result: Substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness on autonomous driving benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula provides a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC is a semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses graph-theoretic constraints to enforce global topology, improving segmentation accuracy in computational pathology with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks in computational pathology where dense annotations are costly.

Method: Proposes Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: Experiments on GlaS and CRAG datasets show TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: TGC effectively enforces global topology in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, providing improved accuracy for computational pathology applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing supervised and unsupervised person re-identification methods, highlighting supervised approaches' maturity and unsupervised methods' narrowing performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised person ReID requires extensive labeled data which poses scalability challenges, while unsupervised methods leverage abundant unlabeled data to overcome labeling limitations.

Method: Dual-focus survey approach: reviewing and categorizing supervised person ReID publications, and exploring latest unsupervised advancements from past three years.

Result: Supervised approaches show little room for further improvement, while unsupervised techniques demonstrate promising developments and narrowing performance gap with supervised methods.

Conclusion: The survey captures both mature supervised landscape and promising unsupervised outcomes, contributing to understanding performance convergence between the two paradigms in person re-identification.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STM (Sequential Token Merging) reduces token redundancy in Vision Mambas while preserving sequential dependencies, achieving minimal accuracy loss with significant token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas suffer from quadratic token scaling with image resolution, and existing methods overlook the intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) mechanism.

Method: Proposes STM with bidirectional nearest neighbor merging for symmetric spatial aggregation and hidden states protection to stabilize class token regions.

Result: Achieves only 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction and 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction.

Conclusion: STM provides state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity while offering new insights into state-space model dynamics.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

### [7] [Deep Learning Empowered Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22692)
*Le Zhang,Ao Li,Qibin Hou,Ce Zhu,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of super-resolution methods covering SISR, VSR, SSR, and LFSR with analysis of over 150+70+30 methods, methodologies, datasets, and evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys focus on specific domains, lacking comprehensive overview of the super-resolution field despite significant advances in deep learning and growing demand for high-quality visual applications.

Method: In-depth review and taxonomy of diverse SR methods based on backbone structures, covering methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical results, and complexity analysis.

Result: Comprehensive coverage of over 150 SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR and LFSR with detailed analysis and taxonomy.

Conclusion: This work serves as a valuable resource and offers guidance to researchers in super-resolution, with a dedicated repository created to facilitate access to related work.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-style contrastive learning framework optimizes Vision-Language Models for hyperspectral image understanding by aligning voxel-level embeddings with text representations using minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images present unique challenges due to their high-dimensional 3D structure, and existing vision-language models are not well-optimized for this domain. Efficient learning requires curation of high-value data rather than brute-force scaling.

Method: Uses a CLIP-style contrastive training framework where voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone are mapped to a frozen large embedding model's latent space. A trainable probe aligns vision features with textual token representations using contrastive loss with hard and semi-hard negatives, plus descriptive prompts for enhanced alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.07% parameter updates: +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on Indian Pines, +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University. Uses 50× fewer parameters than DCTN and 90× fewer than SS-TMNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively aligns hyperspectral image embeddings with text representations using minimal parameter updates, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing unimodal and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM is a one-shot federated prompt learning method that uses attention masking to restrict interaction between text and prompt embeddings, enabling cross-task generalization without multi-round communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FPL methods require multi-round communication to use global information, and one-shot FL methods lack cross-task generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses attention isolation module to suppress prompt-to-text attention and reweight text-to-prompt attention, plus cross-silo collaborative refinement to integrate decentralized visual knowledge and align multi-source cross-modal knowledge.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets in both class-level and domain-level generalization under two tasks.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM effectively enables one-shot federated prompt learning with strong cross-task generalization by controlling attention interactions and aligning cross-modal knowledge.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

*Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GZSL-MoE integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers into Generative Zero-Shot Learning for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, improving performance on both seen and unseen classes in HRC environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration environments.

Method: Combines Generative Zero-Shot Learning with Mixture-of-Experts layers in Generator and Discriminator components, using KPConv for feature extraction and generating fake features that resemble real features from seen classes.

Result: The GZSL-MoE model enhances performance on both seen and unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments when complete training data is unavailable, demonstrating improved segmentation performance across all classes.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers enhanced with learned inductive biases achieve better accuracy on small datasets without needing Knowledge Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which limits their performance on small datasets where these biases cannot be learned from data alone.

Method: Introduce inductive biases into Vision Transformers through learned masks, creating Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT).

Result: IBiT models are significantly more accurate on small datasets while maintaining Transformer explainability.

Conclusion: Learned inductive biases enable Vision Transformers to perform well on small datasets without requiring Knowledge Distillation.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [12] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent is an agentic framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate realistic multi-object scene layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit spatial reasoning for realistic object layouts, while traditional spatial planning methods in robotics struggle with semantic richness in visual scenes.

Method: Uses visual-language model for input preprocessing (segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, prompt rewriting), then compositional diffusion to synthesize bounding boxes respecting object relations, and finally a foreground-conditioned image generator to compose the complete scene.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed LayoutAgent framework successfully bridges the gap between high-quality image generation and explicit spatial reasoning for realistic multi-object scene layout generation.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

### [13] [CompareBench: A Benchmark for Visual Comparison Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22737)
*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench is a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in VLMs, revealing systematic limitations in temporal ordering, spatial relations, counting, and geometric comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual comparison reasoning is a fundamental but understudied skill in vision-language models that needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created CompareBench with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (quantity, temporal, geometric, spatial) derived from auxiliary datasets TallyBench and HistCaps, then evaluated both closed-source and open-source VLMs.

Result: Models show scaling trends but consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs, and CompareBench provides a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

### [14] [MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761)
*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time reasoning method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent space using policy gradient optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation methods are limited to single modalities or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning, creating a need for more flexible cross-modal reasoning approaches.

Method: MILR performs joint reasoning in a unified latent space by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens using policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic, operating entirely at test time within the MUG framework.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks, with an 80% improvement over baseline on knowledge-intensive WISE (0.63 overall score).

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in unified latent space is key to MILR's strong performance, demonstrating non-trivial abilities in temporal and cultural reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

### [15] [UESA-Net: U-Shaped Embedded Multidirectional Shrinkage Attention Network for Ultrasound Nodule Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22763)
*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention that improves breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation by bridging global context with local details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on TN3K and BUSI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast and thyroid cancers are increasing public health burdens. Ultrasound imaging suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions, making accurate lesion segmentation challenging with existing networks.

Method: Proposed UESA-Net with encoder-decoder architecture using multidirectional shrinkage attention. Attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions with shrinkage strategy to integrate prior knowledge and local features. Decoder uses pairwise shrinkage mechanism combining prior cues with encoder features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on TN3K (3493 images) with IoU 0.8487 and BUSI (780 images) with IoU 0.6495.

Conclusion: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

*Fernando Julio Cendra,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo is a novel framework that enhances Generalized Category Discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures and improve category distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on semantic labels and global image representations, overlooking detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories.

Method: Introduces PartCo (Part-Level Correspondence Prior) framework that leverages part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures, seamlessly integrating with existing GCD methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show PartCo significantly improves performance of current GCD approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, setting new benchmarks for Generalized Category Discovery.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT is an efficient fine-tuning framework for Text-to-Image models that decomposes weight updates into two low-rank components to balance task adaptation with model editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing target distribution alignment, novel concept learning from limited data, and maintaining instruction ability for multiple tasks while preserving editability in efficient fine-tuning of T2I models.

Method: Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning (DEFT) adapts pre-trained weights by decomposing updates into: (1) projection onto complement of low-rank subspace, and (2) low-rank update within that subspace using two trainable low-rank matrices.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus (personalization), InsDet (object/scene adaptation), and VisualCloze (universal generation) datasets with both Stable Diffusion and unified models.

Conclusion: DEFT demonstrates emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning, achieving optimal balance between task adaptation and model editability while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional, interpretable framework for evaluating text-to-video generation that assesses visual quality, text-video alignment, and physical consistency while providing detailed rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluators provide only single opaque scores or coarse analysis, lacking interpretability and comprehensive assessment of video quality across multiple dimensions.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VideoFeedback2 dataset (27,168 human-annotated videos) followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness.

Result: Achieves 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks, providing interpretable assessments for controllable generation through reward modeling.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges the gap between evaluation and controllable generation by offering multi-dimensional, human-aligned assessments with chain-of-thought rationales, enabling better reward modeling for text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST is a test-time adaptation method for State Space Models that uses uncertainty-guided traversal permutations to improve robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State Space Models like VMamba show degraded generalization performance under distribution shifts, necessitating adaptation methods that leverage their unique architectural properties.

Method: Generates multiple causal perspectives of input images through diverse traversal permutations, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to update Mamba-specific parameters, and averages adapted weights across traversal scans.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages SSM architectural properties for adaptation, effectively addressing distribution shift challenges in vision tasks.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB is the first extensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on personalization, comprising 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in four categories, with a focus on human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual personalization is crucial for user-facing AI systems, but current VLMs remain underexplored in adapting to individual users, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: MMPB evaluates 23 VLMs using a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying across three task types highlighting different VLM properties.

Result: Most VLMs struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining dialogue consistency, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues, revealing refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting issues.

Conclusion: MMPB identifies significant limitations in VLM personalization capabilities and provides a scalable benchmark for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI systems.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation that allows attackers to choose both input image and target class, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 99% attack success rates while maintaining visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial patch attacks rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability.

Method: Combines generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement for semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16), with attack success rates and target-class success consistently exceeding 99%.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability - the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive and challenging, while existing explainable models often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Method: Uses patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing, embedding attention mechanisms into training for intrinsic explainability of temporal saliency.

Result: Outperforms most transformer-based models on real-world forecasting tasks, demonstrates superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy across datasets of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet addresses the gap between explainability and performance, offering a balanced approach that effectively captures temporal saliency while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate IGTV delineation in PET/CT imaging is crucial for lung cancer radiation therapy but is challenging due to limited annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries.

Method: Transfer learning methodology using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained on extensive GTV datasets and fine-tuned on private IGTV cohort. Introduced slice interaction module (SIM) with channel and spatial attention branches in 2.5D segmentation framework to address weak PET intensities at tumor boundaries.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.609 on private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing conventional baseline score of 0.385.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential of transfer learning combined with multimodal techniques and SIM to enhance reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Conclusion: ControlEvents provides an effective solution for generating labeled event datasets, significantly reducing data collection costs while maintaining high quality and enabling powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic

ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration using implicit neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computational costs through randomized basis sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based DIR methods require large datasets and struggle with precision on some organs/modalities, while implicit neural representations need instance-specific optimization with computational efficiency and learning stability challenges.

Method: Proposed KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with implicit neural representations, featuring randomized basis sampling to reduce required basis functions while maintaining registration quality.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy among INR-based methods across lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds.

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms learnable basis function indices while eliminating additional training complexity, demonstrating KANs' effectiveness in deformable image registration.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CST is a neural architecture that processes image sets of arbitrary size, handling 3D image tensors directly for simultaneous feature extraction and contextual modeling, outperforming existing methods in set classification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks like Deep Sets and Set Transformer are limited to vector inputs and require separate feature extractors, preventing synergies between feature extraction and inter-image relationship modeling.

Method: CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously through a novel architecture that combines convolutional processing with set-based operations.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection tasks, provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods like Grad-CAM, and supports pre-training and transfer learning.

Conclusion: CST offers a more effective approach for processing visually heterogeneous image sets with shared semantics, enabling better performance and interpretability while supporting standard transfer learning practices.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST effectively addresses infrared small target detection challenges through architectural optimizations, achieving superior accuracy and real-time performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections

pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous submanifold field-based embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting to address the non-unique and heterogeneous nature of raw Gaussian parameters in neural network learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw Gaussian parameters in 3DGS are hard to learn as features due to their non-unique and heterogeneous nature, leading to data-dependent models that don't generalize well.

Method: Develops an embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity.

Result: The proposed representation preserves underlying color and geometric structure while making 3DGS more suitable for neural network learning frameworks.

Conclusion: The continuous submanifold field embedding provides a more principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks, benefiting learning of 3DGS.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Motivation: One-step generators distilled from MDMs suffer from modeling bias inheritance and discrete token outputs that block gradient flow, preventing further refinements.

Method: Replace discrete tokens with expected embeddings under generator's output distribution (soft embeddings), integrated into Di[M]O distillation framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN refinement, higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image.

Conclusion: Soft embeddings enable end-to-end trainable one-step generators compatible with various refinement techniques, achieving superior performance across multiple MDM teachers.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 is an intelligent marine fish recognition framework that uses multimodal few-shot deep learning with image generation for data augmentation to address data scarcity in rare species identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracy of 91.67% and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97% at family level, outperforming baseline models. At genus and species levels, achieves 87.58% and 85.42% Top-1 accuracy respectively, showing practical utility for minority classes with <10 training samples.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 improves efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification, provides scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, demonstrating both scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automatic deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from MRI scans using ResNet50 with a novel Dense-Dropout sequence and introduces a new balanced dataset (MMCBT) to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors from MRI scans is critical for improving patient outcomes, but there's a lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources for research.

Method: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction with Global Average Pooling and linear projection, followed by a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance non-linear feature learning and reduce overfitting.

Result: Created the MMCBT dataset with 209 subjects (3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, clinically verified) and applied data augmentation to address class imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with Dense-Dropout sequence and balanced MMCBT dataset provides an efficient solution for automated brain tumor detection from MRI scans.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

TL;DR: Hemorica is a public dataset of 372 head CT scans with comprehensive annotations for five ICH subtypes, enabling robust AI development for intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented public data problem hindering AI development for timely intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis on CT scans.

Method: Created Hemorica dataset with double-reading workflow, neurosurgeon adjudication, and fine-tuned standard convolutional and transformer architectures for binary classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: Lightweight models achieved 87.8% F1 score for binary classification and 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, validating annotation quality and sufficient sample size.

Conclusion: Hemorica provides a unified benchmark supporting multi-task learning, transfer to weakly labeled cohorts, and facilitates AI assistant development for ICH detection and quantification.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS is an autoregressive framework that uses GPT-style models for novel view generation from single images, outperforming diffusion models in consistency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have limitations in world modeling tasks like novel view generation due to non-causal generation causing inconsistencies across views, while autoregressive models offer better causal structure.

Method: Uses GPT-style decoder-only AR model with video tokenizer for image sequences, camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, and autoregressive transformer with spatial permutation while maintaining temporal order.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARSS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-based view synthesis approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS demonstrates that autoregressive models can effectively handle novel view generation tasks while maintaining consistency across views, offering advantages over diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models excessively rely on static cues rather than dynamic human motion, leading to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition.

Method: Uses statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams combined with a scene prediction loss to separate temporal dynamic information from static scene information.

Result: The method effectively reduces static bias and experiments confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates static bias in action recognition models by separating dynamic motion information from static scene context.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [35] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) to reduce DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features, improving robustness against corrupted point clouds while maintaining clean data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to scene complexity and sensor inaccuracies. DNNs' over-reliance on input features makes them vulnerable, and it's unclear if this issue exists in 3D tasks and whether reducing feature dependence can enhance robustness.

Method: Proposed DesenAT: 1) Quantified feature sensitivity using Shapley values, 2) Generated adversarial samples by eliminating high-contribution points and applying spatial transformations, 3) Used self-distillation to transfer knowledge from clean to adversarial samples, 4) Conducted adversarial training within distillation framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C show the method effectively improves model robustness against corrupted point clouds without reducing performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: DesenAT successfully alleviates DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features by smoothing sensitivity through adversarial training and self-distillation, enhancing robustness to corrupted data while preserving clean data performance.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel sign language translation method that incorporates anatomical constraints and joint relationships to generate more natural and biomechanically plausible body movements from text to video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating accurate and natural body poses in sign language translation, as prior methods often produce rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs by neglecting anatomical constraints and coordination patterns.

Method: Explicitly models skeletal joint relationships with geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. Uses parent-relative reweighting for finger flexibility, bone-pose losses, and bone-length constraints to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: Reduced performance gap between previous best and ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, decreased bone length discrepancies by 18.76%, and reduced movement variance discrepancies by 5.48%.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in anatomical realism and motion naturalness for sign language translation from text to video.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan is a planning framework using unified multimodal models (UMMs) that enables reasoning through generated visual content, outperforming vision-language models in long-horizon planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM/VLM-based decision-making approaches rely solely on language reasoning, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. UMMs with multimodal inputs/outputs offer greater potential for decision-making through visual reasoning.

Method: Built on UMMs where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Introduces self-discriminated filtering to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions by using the generative model as a self-discriminator.

Result: Substantially improves success rates on long-horizon planning tasks compared to VLM-based methods, shows strong data scalability without requiring expert demonstrations, and achieves better performance with same training data size.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with unified multimodal models, demonstrating their superior potential over language-only approaches.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models using differential privacy principles and fine-tuning simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address legal and ethical concerns about large vision models memorizing and reproducing copyrighted content, and overcome limitations of existing detection approaches that lack robustness and theoretical foundations.

Method: Formalize copyright infringement detection using Differential Privacy concepts, introduce conditional sensitivity metric, and propose DPM framework that simulates inclusion/exclusion processes via fine-tuning in opposite directions (learning/unlearning), with confidence scoring over orthogonal prompt distributions.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to original training data or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for intellectual property protection.

Conclusion: The proposed DPM framework provides a robust, theoretically-grounded approach for copyright infringement detection in generative AI models, addressing critical legal and ethical challenges in the deployment of large vision models.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a principled framework to optimize perceptual loss design for Low-Dose CT denoising, showing that better loss configurations significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual losses are promising for LDCT denoising but their design involves critical underexplored decisions about feature representation levels, pretraining datasets, and loss weighting that impact performance.

Method: Proposed perceptual influence metric to quantify perceptual loss contribution, and developed a systematic framework to assess impact of loss design choices through systematic experimentation.

Result: Widely used perceptual loss configurations underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Optimized perceptual loss designs achieve significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images.

Conclusion: The study provides objective guidelines for effective perceptual loss design in LDCT denoising, supported by statistical analysis, enabling better performance without architectural changes.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [40] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight multi-modal transformer model called Presto (0.4M parameters) is introduced for flexible flood detection using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS data, outperforming larger baselines while maintaining robustness across different sensor availability scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address operational challenges in flood mapping where single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require heavy computational resources and large labeled datasets.

Method: Fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both SAR and multispectral data at pixel level, enabling flood mapping with flexible sensor inputs through a single model architecture.

Result: Achieved superior performance with F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming Prithvi-100M baseline. Maintained effective performance in MS-only (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718).

Conclusion: The parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach provides an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r enhances relative camera pose estimation by training regression networks with Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR), achieving both fast inference speed and high accuracy without geometric computation at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the speed-accuracy dilemma in camera pose estimation, where regression methods like ReLoc3R are fast but have geometric inconsistencies, while correspondence-based methods like MASt3R are accurate but slow.

Method: Uses ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences during training, weights them with a FusionTransformer, computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC, and transfers this geometric knowledge to the regression network through a consistency loss.

Result: Significantly outperforms ReLoc3R across benchmarks: 40.45% vs 34.85% AUC@5° on CO3Dv2 (16% improvement), 68.66% vs 66.70% on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs 49.60% on MegaDepth1500.

Conclusion: GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, achieving both regression speed and correspondence method accuracy.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning system for recognizing upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in stroke patients using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera, addressing the gap in existing HAR research that primarily focuses on non-disabled individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortage of rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients by developing remote monitoring systems that reduce medical staff burden, specifically focusing on stroke patients' action recognition which has been largely overlooked in existing HAR research.

Method: Designed a monitoring system using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera, directly collected a dataset of stroke patients' upper limb ADL, investigated appropriate preprocessing, and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data.

Result: Found that stroke patients' action data is less clustering than non-disabled individuals' data, and the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with difficult-to-cluster features.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for expanding deep learning models trained on stroke patients' action features beyond simple recognition to include assessment feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation, with code available for further research.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [43] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An activation-matching approach generates minimal binary masks that preserve both model predictions and intermediate activations, providing faithful explanations for classifier decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create minimal, faithful explanations for pretrained classifiers that preserve model behavior while highlighting only relevant input regions.

Method: Train lightweight autoencoder to output binary masks using multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence + cross-entropy), mask priors (L1 area, binarization penalty, total variation), and abductive constraints.

Result: Produces small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant regions, yielding practical minimalist explanations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generates faithful and minimal explanations that preserve model decision-making while being interpretable to humans.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask What Matters is a text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language models to apply differentiated masking on diagnostically relevant regions, achieving better performance with lower masking ratios than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity in medical imaging and improve semantic alignment in self-supervised learning by moving beyond random high-ratio masking approaches that are inefficient and lack semantic focus.

Method: Leverages vision-language models for prompt-based region localization to apply controllable, differentiated masking that emphasizes diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.

Result: Outperforms existing MIM methods across multiple medical imaging modalities (brain MRI, chest CT, lung X-ray) with gains of up to +3.1% in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP, while using substantially lower masking ratios (40% vs 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable, text-driven masking enables semantically aligned self-supervised learning and advances the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR is a novel framework for aerial-view object detection that uses frequency-decoupled fusion to address challenges in detecting tiny objects in high-resolution imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-view object detection faces challenges in detecting tiny objects due to limited visual cues and difficulty modeling global context. Existing methods suffer from delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes FMC-DETR with three key components: 1) WeKat backbone using cascaded wavelet transforms for global low-frequency context perception and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for adaptive non-linear modeling; 2) Cross-stage Partial Fusion module for multi-scale feature interaction; 3) Multi-Domain Feature Coordination module unifying spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 improvements over baseline on VisDrone dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in tiny object detection with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR effectively addresses the challenges of aerial-view tiny object detection through frequency-decoupled fusion, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

*Yutao Shen,Junkun Yuan,Toru Aonishi,Hideki Nakayama,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits fundamental problems in image inpainting preference alignment using direct preference optimization and public reward models, finding that most reward models provide valid scores for preference data construction, preference data shows robust scaling trends, reward models have observable biases, and simple ensemble methods yield robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fundamental problems in achieving preference alignment for image inpainting by going back to basics rather than introducing novel methods, and to establish a simple yet solid baseline for this promising frontier.

Method: Leveraged direct preference optimization approach for alignment training, employed public reward models to construct preference training datasets, conducted experiments across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms.

Result: Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for preference data construction; preference data shows robust trends in candidate and sample scaling; reward models have observable biases in brightness, composition, and color scheme that cause reward hacking; simple ensemble of models yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations without changes to model structures or new datasets, establishing a simple yet solid baseline for image inpainting preference alignment.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

*Ziyu Su,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Anil V. Parwani,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model for computational pathology that uses cross-magnification distillation from 20x to 5x magnification, achieving comparable accuracy to larger models with 30x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in computational pathology are computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from 20x teacher to 5x student architecture, using dual-level knowledge transfer (global representations and local spatial token mapping) and trained on 3.49 million images.

Result: Achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of larger foundation models with 30-fold processing acceleration (8.8 WSIs per minute), requiring 11.3x fewer patches per WSI.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation enables deployment of foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that enhances spatial representations in both text and image modalities using internal model components, achieving significant improvements without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundational vision-language models like CLIP struggle with spatial relationships - they focus on primary noun phrases in text and generate similar features for images with different spatial layouts, limiting spatial grounding capabilities.

Method: CoPatch constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens with spatial cues, and extracts patch-level image features from intermediate layers where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: CoPatch significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut datasets (+2-7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of recovering and leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, opening new opportunities for zero-shot referring image segmentation.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding in-memory computing to reduce multiplication operations in DNNs by up to 52% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing multiplication costs is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment in energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: Selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers implemented via multiplication-avoiding SRAM-based in-memory operations.

Result: Eliminates up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet models while achieving comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset for remote sensing change understanding, and proposes ChangeVG, a vision-guided vision-language model with dual-granularity awareness that outperforms existing methods on change captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks for remote sensing images, creating a need for more comprehensive datasets and models.

Method: Constructed ChangeIMTI dataset covering four tasks, and designed ChangeVG model with vision-guided module using dual-branch architecture combining fine-grained spatial features with high-level semantic summarization as auxiliary prompts for VLMs during instruction tuning.

Result: Outperforms strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on S*m metric for change captioning, demonstrating superiority across four tasks through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed ChangeIMTI dataset and ChangeVG model effectively address gaps in remote sensing change understanding through multi-task learning and vision-guided architecture, showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

TL;DR: A unified multistage generative framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, enabling accurate distribution learning and end-to-end optimization within a single Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing image generation models including: VAE-based models suffering from information loss and limited detail; pixel-space models having prohibitive computational costs; cascade models preventing effective end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Method: Proposes Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that decomposes generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, implemented as a single unified Diffusion Transformer to enable end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions, overcoming the computation-fidelity trade-off in existing approaches.

Conclusion: The unified multistage framework successfully addresses key challenges in image generation by enabling accurate distribution learning, end-to-end optimization, and knowledge sharing while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Motivation: Current MLLMs lack capability for complex EO tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and domain-specific tools. Existing agent-based methods are limited to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lack systematic evaluation.

Method: Earth-Agent integrates RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling dynamic invocation of expert tools and models across modalities for quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, advancing the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM applications in Earth observation with comprehensive evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth

TL;DR: WeatherCycle is an unsupervised framework for multi-weather image restoration that uses bidirectional degradation-content translation with degradation-aware curriculum regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions is challenging, and existing methods relying on task-specific physical priors have limited scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios.

Method: WeatherCycle uses lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content, a Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) for learning luminance degradation priors via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, and a Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) module for semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple weather datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: The proposed WeatherCycle framework effectively addresses multi-weather image restoration through a unified unpaired approach with degradation-aware curriculum regularization, showing superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense is a keypoint-driven generative framework that uses extremely sparse 3D keypoints for ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction, enabling bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression while maintaining accurate vertex prediction, which requires harmonizing dynamic motion modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency for bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model that encodes complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints, uses these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis, and integrates a vertex predictor for joint optimization with video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs while enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense facilitates bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission for applications like real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end video-based pipeline for vehicle axle counting using YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection and YOLO for tire detection, with a novel TRAX algorithm to handle occlusions and improve accuracy for long vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development, but previous methods have limitations in dense environments with occluded vehicles.

Method: Combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with intelligent tire-to-vehicle association and a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to handle occlusions and partial detections.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems that can replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM is a lightweight adaptation framework that improves SAM's performance on medical volumes by reducing domain shift sensitivity and penalizing overconfident errors, achieving better accuracy and calibration while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM shows strong zero-shot performance on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes, requiring adaptation for medical imaging tasks.

Method: Uses Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift on 3D feature maps, and Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize overconfident voxel-wise errors. Fine-tunes only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.

Result: Significant improvements on cross-center and scanner-shift evaluations: +7.4% DSC improvement, -26.9% HD95 reduction, -39.5% ECE reduction on BraTS scanner split. On ATLAS-C, +5.3% DSC improvement and -32.6% ECE reduction. FIP and CMP show complementary gains with modest training overhead.

Conclusion: CalSAM delivers improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for brain MRI segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency by freezing SAM's encoder.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

TL;DR: A new unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation framework that uses synthetic point cloud generation, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic-weighting loss to outperform existing methods without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D instance segmentation methods like UNIT have limitations including limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels.

Method: Proposes synthetic point cloud sequence generation for diverse training data, flexible temporal sampling using both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, and dynamic-weighting loss to emphasize confident samples.

Result: Outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets with higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods through synthetic data generation and improved temporal modeling, achieving superior performance in unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaP (Gaussian Patch) is a black-box adversarial attack method that creates a universal, physically transferable forehead patch using a query-efficient greedy algorithm with Gaussian blobs, achieving high attack success rates on face recognition systems with limited queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems pose significant security threats, but most existing methods are limited to digital domains or require white-box access. There's a need for practical black-box attacks that can work in physical settings.

Method: Uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale forehead patch. The method adds Gaussian blobs guided by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to degrade identity recognition.

Result: With approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, GaP achieves high attack success rates in both digital and real-world physical tests. The attack shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an unseen FaceNet model.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a practical and severe vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

### [62] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI (Patch Rebirth Inversion) is a novel model inversion method that progressively detaches important patches while allowing others to evolve, achieving 10x speedup over Dense Model Inversion while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model inversion is computationally expensive for Vision Transformers, and existing sparse methods like SMI discard patches prematurely, suppressing both class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge extraction.

Method: PRI incrementally detaches the most important patches during inversion to create sparse synthetic images, while letting remaining patches continue evolving for future selection, enabling the Re-Birth effect where less informative patches gradually accumulate class-relevant knowledge.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than Dense Model Inversion and 2x faster than SMI, while matching DMI's performance and consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy.

Conclusion: The progressive patch detachment strategy effectively balances class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge extraction, demonstrating that allowing patches to evolve rather than discarding them prematurely leads to better efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-consistency framework that uses short binary answers to evaluate and rank model-generated long responses, automatically creating preference pairs for training without human annotations or external supervision to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods require extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models.

Method: Leverages model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs. Uses short binary questions to get reliable responses, then compares detailed responses against concise binary answers to identify inconsistencies and automatically curate training data.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability across multiple benchmarks (AMBER, MultiObject-Hal, Object HalBench, MMHal-Bench). Maintains robust instruction-following ability with enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: The self-consistency approach offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data, without requiring human annotations or external model-based supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

TL;DR: TATTOO is a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation approach that uses Multimodal Large Language Models to generate item descriptions and aesthetic profiles, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion outfit-completion tools require expensive task-specific training on large labeled data and lack explicit human aesthetics guidance. The authors aim to leverage MLLMs to create a training-free paradigm with better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness.

Method: TATTOO uses MLLMs to generate target-item descriptions and aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill images into structured aesthetic profiles (color, style, occasion, season, material, balance). It fuses visual summaries with textual descriptions and aesthetics vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism for candidate ranking in shared embedding space.

Result: Experiments on Aesthetic-100 show TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to training-based methods. On Polyvore dataset, it demonstrates advanced zero-shot retrieval capability.

Conclusion: The conventional training-based pipeline can be streamlined to a training-free paradigm using MLLMs, achieving better recommendation scores with enhanced aesthetic awareness in fashion outfit recommendation.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging improves ADAS safety in low-light and harsh weather, but research is limited by dataset scarcity and poor simulator representation. RGB-to-thermal translation offers a solution, but existing one-to-one mappings are insufficient.

Method: Multi-modal translation framework with Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) that adapts styles to different image components individually, unlike global style application in original AdaIN.

Result: The method produces more realistic and diverse thermal image translations compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enables effective one-to-many RGB-to-thermal mapping, addressing limitations in thermal imaging research for ADAS applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based HAR that is robust to illumination changes, using LiDAR point clouds instead.

Method: Map LiDAR frames to proximity graphs, compute Laplacian spectrum, use eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics as pose descriptors, and apply temporal statistics over sliding windows for classification with SVMs and random forests.

Result: Achieved 94.4% accuracy on 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all 27 activities under subject-independent protocol, outperforming skeleton-based baselines on MM-Fi dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides a compact, interpretable feature set directly from point cloud geometry, offering an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning for HAR.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS is a novel framework that combines generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view novel view synthesis using Gaussian Splatting, employing a "propose-and-validate" approach with 3D-aware diffusion models and multi-view stereo validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face a trade-off between geometric fidelity (regressive models) and scene completion (generative models), with generative models often introducing structural inconsistencies while regressive models remain incomplete.

Method: Uses a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views for complete scene proposal, then repurposes a multi-view stereo model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate 3D uncertainties via attention maps, guiding Gaussian Splatting optimization with uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic, achieving better balance between generative completeness and geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity by conditioning generative priors on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

*Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han,Yanbei Jiang,Yan Li,Zechuan Li,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynDoc is a framework combining discriminative and generative models for domain-specific document understanding, using synthetic data generation and adaptive instruction tuning to address limitations of existing LLMs/MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs/MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific VRDU including hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive fields like medicine, finance, and material science.

Method: Combines discriminative and generative models with synthetic data generation workflow using structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation, plus adaptive instruction tuning and recursive inferencing mechanism.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction.

Conclusion: SynDoc effectively addresses domain-specific VRDU challenges through its novel combination of models and synthetic data approach, providing stable and accurate predictions for sensitive document fields.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an adversarial attack that adds perturbations to images to block motion synthesis in image-to-video models while preserving image semantics, preventing malicious video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks from image-to-video generation models that can create deceptive content, by developing proactive defenses that block motion synthesis.

Method: Attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted perturbations to images, explicitly targeting the attention mechanism of I2V models.

Result: Immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation while preserving semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Attention attacks are a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

### [71] [Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23289)
*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake detection framework that uses defocus blur as a forensic signal to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones by analyzing depth-dependent optical phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI has made synthetic images increasingly photorealistic, threatening visual media integrity. Current methods struggle to distinguish authentic from fabricated content, especially in deepfake scenarios.

Method: Proposes using defocus blur maps as discriminative features. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images but is often missing or unrealistic in synthetic images. The framework constructs defocus blur maps and uses them for detection.

Result: Experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. The approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Defocus blur serves as a robust and generalizable forensic cue for deepfake detection due to its universal optical imaging principles. The framework contributes meaningfully to media forensics research and is publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera streams, using enhanced texture extraction and ControlNet to handle low-light high-speed scenarios where traditional methods struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce unique asynchronous spike streams that require reconstruction for human perception. Existing methods fail in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information.

Method: Uses ETFI (Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams, then employs ControlNet with ETFI as conditioning input and includes an ETFI-based feature fusion module during generation.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing approaches on real low-light spike streams and establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for this task with quantitative illumination information.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information in challenging low-light conditions, demonstrating superior performance for spike stream reconstruction.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

*Hao Liu,Yongjie Zheng,Yuhan Kang,Mingyang Zhang,Maoguo Gong,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BDGF framework using multimodal diffusion features to guide multi-branch networks for land-cover classification, addressing modality imbalance in DDPMs through adaptive masking and hierarchical feature guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality imbalance in pre-training multimodal DDPMs and effectively leverage diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction for remote sensing classification.

Method: Uses adaptive modality masking for balanced data distribution, hierarchically guides feature extraction across CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks with fusion mechanisms, and employs mutual learning for inter-branch collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate superior classification performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The BDGF framework effectively addresses modality imbalance in DDPMs and successfully leverages diffusion features to enhance multimodal remote sensing classification performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: VLMs lack genuine cultural understanding despite appearing competent, showing systematic biases in identifying cultural imagery across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the limitations of VLMs in cultural understanding beyond superficial pattern matching and assess risks in their reasoning on cultural imagery.

Method: Developed a diagnostic framework testing multiple VLMs on fire-themed cultural imagery through classification and explanation analysis across Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes.

Result: Models correctly identified prominent Western festivals but struggled with underrepresented cultural events, often providing vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic shortcuts, highlighting the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD is a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies robustness and generalization in object detection through two-stage training with EMA mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between robustness (handling adverse conditions) and diversity (generalizing to unseen categories) in object detection, as prior methods excel in one area but struggle in the other.

Method: Two-stage curriculum learning: Stage 1 uses RGBT data for robustness, Stage 2 uses vision-language alignment for generalization, with EMA mechanism to preserve performance between stages.

Result: Achieves 80.1 AP50 on FLIR, 48.6 AP50_Novel on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAPr on OV-LVIS, demonstrating competitive performance across both robustness and diversity benchmarks.

Conclusion: C3-OWD successfully unifies robustness and generalization in object detection through curriculum learning with EMA, establishing state-of-the-art performance across multiple challenging datasets.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

TL;DR: This paper proposes S2BNet, a binary neural network for remote sensing pansharpening that addresses spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation issues through customized S2B-Conv modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for pansharpening have high computational complexity, limiting their use on resource-limited devices. Binarization can reduce complexity but causes spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation.

Method: Designed S2B-Conv with Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) using dynamic affine transformations and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) with random frequency/angle selection to handle multi-scale anisotropic features.

Result: Extensive experiments show the high-efficiency binarized method achieves promising performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed S2BNet successfully applies binary neural networks to pansharpening while maintaining good performance through specialized spatial-spectral binarized convolution modules.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning and perception, using an LLM to orchestrate reasoning while a LMM serves as visual QA engine, reducing visually-unfounded reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic and lose visual grounding as reasoning chains extend, leading to reasoning paths that diverge from image content and produce errors.

Method: Decouple reasoning and perception processes: powerful LLM orchestrates high-level reasoning and strategically queries LMM for specific visual information; LMM functions exclusively as visual QA engine.

Result: Significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity, validated through comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The lightweight, plug-and-play approach effectively governs visual reasoning process without requiring additional training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) addresses multi-label class-incremental learning challenges by using class-specific prompts and progressive confidence decoupling, achieving state-of-the-art performance without replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods work well for single-label incremental learning but fail in multi-label scenarios due to semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling.

Method: DDP uses class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives. It freezes past prompts as knowledge anchors and uses interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: DDP consistently outperforms prior methods on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, becoming the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed DDP framework effectively addresses the core challenges in multi-label class-incremental learning through dual decoupling strategies, achieving superior performance without requiring replay mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10

TL;DR: LRPO is the first online RL framework for Blind Face Restoration that uses likelihood regularization to improve restoration quality while balancing perceptual quality and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration faces challenges with large solution space, leading to artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in restored images.

Method: Proposes Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) with three key strategies: composite reward function, ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show LRPO significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LRPO effectively addresses BFR challenges by combining RL with likelihood regularization, producing high-quality face restoration results.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DentVLM establishes as a robust clinical decision support tool that can enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise in dentistry.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-enhanced flow matching models for text-to-image generation suffer from exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling due to slight variations in sampling groups.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-TreeRPO with tree-structured search using dynamic noise intensities, GRPO-guided optimization, constrained SDE sampling, and LayerTuning-RL that integrates SFT as a dynamically weighted progress reward model with adaptive clipping bounds.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 4.9% on HPS-v2.1, 5.91% on PickScore, and 8.66% on ImageReward benchmarks, while improving training efficiency by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: The tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL paradigm enable dynamic exploration of diverse search spaces, achieving superior semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

Method: Leverages transformation equivariance property of registration by analyzing network prediction variance under spatial perturbations, providing theoretical decomposition of uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, lung) and multiple registration models, uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration errors and highlight problematic regions.

Conclusion: The framework enables any pretrained registration network to become risk-aware at test time, advancing safe deployment in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement method that uses ranking-aware policy optimization to improve CLIP-based retrieval performance under distribution shifts like multilingual, long-form, and multimodal differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with distribution shifts in retrieval tasks (multilingual, long-form, multimodal queries) and existing query-rewriting methods with LLMs lack supervision signals to generate optimal queries aligned with the retriever's training distribution.

Method: Proposes GRAPE which uses Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization (GRPO) to incorporate ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs, using corpus-relative ranking-based rewards to address score inflation issues.

Result: GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under various distributional shifts, achieving an average 4.9% improvement in Recall@10 across multilingual (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length (Wikipedia), and multimodal (CIRR) benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRAPE effectively bridges distributional gaps in CLIP-based retrieval systems through ranking-aware query rewriting, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse distribution shift scenarios without requiring costly retraining.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr is a point cloud completion framework that uses cascaded networks and knowledge distillation to address incomplete point clouds from real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from real-world environments are often incomplete due to limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise, making completion essential for various applications.

Method: The framework decomposes completion into two stages: Shape Reconstruction (generates auxiliary information) and Fused Completion (uses this information with knowledge distillation). A teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers knowledge to the student model.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings show CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The cascaded structure and distillation strategy effectively bridge the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets, enhancing global shape context capture and local detail refinement.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a unified cross-modality method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation that transfers 2D pose annotations to 3D domain using RGB-D sequences without needing 3D ground truth annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations in human pose estimation by leveraging easily acquired RGB-D sequences and transferring knowledge from large-scale 2D pose datasets.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning on RGB-D sequences with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision. Incorporates spatial-temporal constraints, 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction. Features anchor-to-joint prediction method for 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets. Performance improves with large-scale unlabeled data (NTU RGB+D 60) under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates strong potential for practical applications by bridging 2D and 3D domains without multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shift issues, achieving state-of-the-art 3D lifting results.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, and proposes a generative model for self-contact poses conditioned on body shape parameters, which improves single-view pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack variety of poses and precise body shapes, limiting analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. Self-contact modeling requires consideration of underlying body shapes to avoid unrealistic penetrations.

Method: Created Goliath-SC dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Proposed generative modeling using body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention, conditioned by body shape parameters. Incorporated this prior into single-view pose estimation with contact refinement.

Result: Shape conditioning proved vital for successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution. The approach improved single-view pose estimation in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Body shape conditioning is essential for realistic self-contact modeling, and the proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing datasets and improves pose estimation accuracy in self-contact situations.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldSplat is a feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation that bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, enabling high-quality novel-view synthesis of driving videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods: generation methods lack 3D consistency for novel-view synthesis, while reconstruction approaches lack generative capabilities for creating new driving scenes.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) 4D-aware latent diffusion model generates pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians, (2) enhanced video diffusion model refines the rendered novel view videos.

Result: Extensive experiments show WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Conclusion: WorldSplat successfully bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, providing a scalable solution for generating controllable training data for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE is an inference-time framework that uses Bayesian Surprise to identify memorable moments in videos, enabling surprise-weighted frame sampling that outperforms uniform sampling across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Video-LLMs process videos with uniform frame sampling, which often misses critical moments that define a video's narrative, particularly surprising or memorable events.

Method: SPIKE quantifies Bayesian Surprise as belief updates triggered by new visual evidence. SPIKE-RL extends this by using GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on reward signals from video captions. Both guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame sampling.

Result: SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, correlating strongly with human judgments on surprise benchmarks. The surprise-weighted sampling achieves consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks compared to uniform sampling.

Conclusion: By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, this work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

TL;DR: FM-SIREN and FM-FINER address feature redundancy in periodic activation-based implicit neural representations by assigning neuron-specific frequency multipliers based on Nyquist principles, improving reconstruction across various tasks without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activation-based INR networks suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressive capacity.

Method: Assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers to periodic activations, introducing frequency diversity without hyperparameter tuning or additional network depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal reconstruction across 1D audio, 2D image, 3D shape fitting, and NeRF synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-diverse periodic activation design enhances INR performance while maintaining efficiency, outperforming baseline methods across diverse applications.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that enhances text-to-image generation by incorporating Frame of Reference concepts to better handle spatial descriptions from different perspectives, using vision modules and latent-space operations to correct misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a need to integrate Frame of Reference concepts for better spatial reasoning.

Method: Extends SLD framework by evaluating text-image alignment, using vision modules to extract spatial configurations and map spatial expressions to camera perspectives, then applying latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth when misalignment is detected.

Result: Improves performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on spatial understanding benchmarks using only a single correction round.

Conclusion: FoR-SALE successfully integrates Frame of Reference concepts into multimodal language models, significantly enhancing their ability to handle spatial descriptions from various perspectives in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

TL;DR: 3DPCNet is a compact module that converts view-dependent 3D poses into a consistent body-centered frame using hybrid graph-transformer architecture and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons with view-dependent signals that complicate comparative analysis in health and sports applications.

Method: Hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from graph convolutional network with global context from transformer via gated cross-attention, predicting continuous 6D rotation mapped to SO(3) matrix for pose alignment. Trained self-supervised on MM-Fi dataset using synthetic rotations.

Result: Reduces mean rotation error from over 20° to 3.4° and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64mm to 47mm on MM-Fi benchmark. Qualitative evaluation shows strong correspondence to ground-truth IMU data.

Conclusion: The module effectively removes viewpoint variability, enabling physically plausible motion analysis from video by producing consistent body-centered poses.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization can address this without retraining.

Method: Decomposes input prompts into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both global and concept levels using fine-grained CLIP. Uses concept-level feedback in an iterative prompt refinement loop with large language models.

Result: Significantly improves concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over standard test-time optimization and base T2I models on DrawBench and CompBench prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained test-time optimization framework effectively enhances compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation through concept-level analysis and iterative prompt refinement.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal FAS models fail to detect unseen attacks from new domains, and domain adaptation remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS despite being addressed in single-modal approaches.

Method: Proposes three key techniques: complementary feature extraction for missing modalities, uncertainty-based pseudo labeling to reduce noise, and adaptive loss weighting to prevent model degradation during adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of MFAS-DANet in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses the three major challenges in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

*Shourya Verma,Mengbo Wang,Nadia Atallah Lanman,Ananth Grama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RestoRect is a novel image restoration method that uses latent rectified flow feature distillation to transfer knowledge from slow teacher models to fast student models, achieving high performance with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration models face a trade-off between performance and speed - high-performance models are too slow for practical use while fast models produce poor results. Existing knowledge distillation methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features.

Method: Uses latent rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints and trigonometric color space polarization. Introduces Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different architectures.

Result: Achieves better training stability, faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. Demonstrates superior results across 15 image restoration datasets covering 4 tasks on 8 metrics.

Conclusion: RestoRect successfully addresses the performance-speed trade-off in image restoration through novel feature distillation approach, enabling fast inference without sacrificing restoration quality.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

*Junyi Wu,Jiachen Tao,Haoxuan Wang,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) is a novel framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction from monocular videos that uses scene orientation as stable structural guidance to model complex dynamic deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes rely on low-rank assumptions and struggle to model complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes.

Method: OriGS introduces a Global Orientation Field to propagate principal forward directions across space and time, and proposes Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state for inferring region-specific deformations.

Result: Experiments show that OriGS achieves superior reconstruction fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The orientation-anchored approach provides effective structural guidance for modeling complex dynamic deformations, enabling high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

*Divyam Madaan,Varshan Muhunthan,Kyunghyun Cho,Sumit Chopra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale empirical study reveals that multi-modal benchmarks often over-rely on single modalities (vision or text) rather than true multi-modal reasoning, with larger models masking this deficiency through intra-modality dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (individual modality contributions) and inter-modality dependencies (relationships between modalities) in multi-modal learning, which remains poorly characterized in current benchmarks.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), covering domains like general/expert knowledge reasoning, OCR, and document understanding.

Result: Found significant variation in reliance on vision, text, and their interaction across benchmarks. Many benchmarks intended to reduce text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. Larger models often use intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that masks lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation by revealing over-reliance on single modalities rather than genuine multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

TL;DR: A novel polyp segmentation framework that integrates Dynamic Kernel mechanism with global Encoder Attention and Unified Channel Adaptation to improve accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging, requiring improved accuracy and efficiency for colorectal cancer detection.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Kernel mechanism initialized by global context vector from Encoder Attention module, with Unified Channel Adaptation in decoder for standardized feature dimensions and efficient information fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB datasets with superior Dice and IoU scores, while reducing computational costs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues like point-light displays, which isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning. This ability emerges early in development and is attributed to human embodied experience.

Method: Created ActPLD benchmark to test action processing in MLLMs using single-actor and socially interacting point-light displays. Evaluated state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models.

Result: Models showed consistently low performance across all tested conditions, revealing fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle significantly with understanding human actions from minimal visual motion cues, highlighting critical limitations in their action processing capabilities compared to human embodied cognition.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

TL;DR: A novel CT analysis framework using radiomics and deep learning to predict mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, achieving AUCs of 0.769-0.801 for 1-3 year mortality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interstitial lung disease is a major cause of death in systemic sclerosis, but CT's role in predicting disease progression and mortality hasn't been fully established.

Method: Analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients using radiomics and deep learning (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer) pre-trained models fine-tuned for mortality prediction at 1, 3, and 5 years.

Result: Models achieved AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 for predicting mortality within one, three, and five years respectively, with 181, 326, and 428 deaths in the dataset.

Conclusion: Both radiomics and deep learning show strong potential for improving early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive super-resolution framework for driver monitoring that optimizes for model calibration and safety-critical performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on calibration and precision-recall metrics while filtering hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver monitoring systems need reliable, well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. Direct low-resolution training yields high accuracy but produces poorly calibrated predictions that are dangerous in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework with lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms overhead) to filter SR-induced hallucinations.

Result: Achieves best calibration (ECE of 5.8% vs 6.2% for baselines), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71).

Conclusion: While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose baselines, the adaptive framework represents state-of-the-art for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for

achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best

drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R is a training scheme for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that leverages 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction, achieving significant performance improvements on ScanNet200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without costly manual annotation by leveraging existing 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction from videos.

Method: Projects 2D instance masks from open-vocabulary 2D models onto 3D scenes using reconstruction correspondences, introduces View-wise Instance Partition to handle partial annotations, and uses 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint clustering to preserve object boundaries.

Result: Achieves +2.3 mAP overall improvement on ScanNet200 benchmark and +7.1 mAP improvement on novel classes under open-vocabulary setting compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively bridges 2D and 3D perception, enabling robust open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation while significantly reducing performance gaps between head and tail classes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: This survey paper examines how 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly replacing NeRF-based approaches across various domains including SLAM, telepresence, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation, highlighting its advantages in photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3DGS is displacing NeRF-based approaches and to examine its adoption across multiple domains that share common goals of photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks.

Method: The survey systematically compares domain-specific pipelines and organizes the review around unified research questions addressing technical advantages, adaptation to different input modalities, and remaining limitations of 3DGS.

Result: The analysis shows that 3DGS effectively balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for various applications beyond image synthesis including perception, interaction, and content creation.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers a compelling alternative to NeRF that supports enhanced photorealism, faster optimization, and integration into hybrid pipelines, providing a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering across real and virtual environments.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases show regional heterogeneity (cancers in head, chronic pancreatitis in tail), making accurate part segmentation essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. This is challenging in MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical variations.

Method: Privacy-preserving FL framework across 7 institutions. Evaluated 3 segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) with 2 FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx). Used novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture contrasts.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity. Approach achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated first FL approach for pancreas part segmentation in MRI, addressing both technical complexity of part delineation and data scarcity problem through privacy-preserving collaborative training.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter is a brain-to-image decoding framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain signals, bypassing intermediate feature spaces and providing interpretability into how different brain areas influence image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain decoding methods use intermediate image/text features, which mask the contributions of different brain areas. There's a need for more transparent methods that show how brain signals directly shape visual reconstruction.

Method: Proposed NeuroAdapter framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain representations without intermediate features. Developed Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability (IBBI) framework to analyze cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps.

Result: Achieved competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals influence the generation process.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establishes a path for interpreting diffusion models through visual neuroscience, revealing how cortical areas influence the generative trajectory.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuQ is a systematic QAT framework for Diffusion Transformers that enables stable sub-4-bit quantization through robust activation quantization and mixed-precision allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers show superior performance but face practical deployment challenges due to high computational and memory costs, with activation quantization being the primary bottleneck for low-bit settings.

Method: Establishes ternary weight baseline, proposes RobustQuantizer using Hadamard transform for activation quantization, and introduces AMPN pipeline for activation-only mixed-precision allocation across layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit configurations, enabling stable image generation on ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits.

Conclusion: RobuQ successfully addresses activation quantization challenges in DiTs, making low-bit deployment practical while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace is a novel one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement that addresses challenges in facial texture modeling, temporal consistency, model generalization, and efficiency through flow matching, joint latent-pixel training, and automated data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face enhancement methods face three key challenges: difficulty in modeling intricate facial textures while maintaining temporal consistency, limited model generalization due to lack of high-quality training data, and low efficiency from repeated denoising steps during inference.

Method: VividFace uses a one-step diffusion framework built on pretrained WANX video generation model with flow matching paradigm. It employs Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training with stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, and uses an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated dataset selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VividFace provides an efficient and effective solution for video face enhancement that outperforms existing methods in quality and efficiency, offering practical resources for the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

### [109] [Multi-Level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer Network on Forward Scattering Center Model for Limited Samples SAR ATR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23596)
*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer network that uses forward scattering center model data instead of simulated images to transfer purer target knowledge for SAR target recognition, addressing issues with irrelevant information in traditional simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods contain irrelevant information like background and noise that affects knowledge transfer quality. The authors aim to use forward scattering center model data which has stronger physical meaning and interpretability to migrate purer target knowledge.

Method: Proposed Multi-level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer (MHKT) network that transfers FSCM knowledge at feature, distribution and category levels. Uses Task-Associated Information Selector (TAIS) for feature purification, Maximum Discrimination Divergence (MDD) metric for distribution alignment, and Category Relation Knowledge Transfer (CRKT) module to handle data imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on two new datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The stepwise knowledge selection and migration approach using FSCM data ensures integrity of migrated target knowledge and effectively addresses the limited sample problem in SAR target recognition.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

TL;DR: VAMamba is a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework that overcomes limitations of fixed scanning patterns in Mamba-based image restoration through two innovations: QCLAM for dynamic feature reuse and GPS-SS2D for adaptive scanning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods are limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes VAMamba with two key components: 1) QCLAM uses a FIFO cache to store historical representations and guides feature fusion via similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features; 2) GPS-SS2D uses a Vision Transformer to generate score maps for pixel importance and a greedy strategy to determine optimal scanning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Conclusion: The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency, making it a superior solution for adaptive image restoration.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,

A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid

TL;DR: Deep taxonomic networks use a complete binary tree mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference to automatically discover hierarchical taxonomies and prototype clusters from unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods that tie structure to class numbers and underutilize prototype information at intermediate hierarchical levels.

Method: Deep latent variable approach with complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference framework, optimizing ELBO to discover hierarchical relationships.

Result: Strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image datasets, discovering rich interpretable taxonomies with coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks effectively bridge gaps in hierarchical clustering by automatically discovering taxonomic structures and prototype clusters without assuming true label sizes.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide superior quality for LDCT denoising but have extreme computational costs (thousands of seconds per scan), hindering clinical adoption. There's a need to bridge the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability.

Method: Operates in compressed latent space via perceptually-optimized autoencoder, using attention-based conditional U-Net for fast deterministic conditional denoising diffusion process with reduced overhead.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced generative models in medical imaging by bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability through efficient latent space diffusion.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMDiff is a diffusion-based framework that creates coherent fused images from multiple sources by addressing coexistent generation (juxtaposition without integration) and bias generation (one object dominating) through hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image fusion methods struggle with coexistent generation (multiple objects simply juxtaposed) and bias generation (one object dominating due to semantic imbalance), limiting their effectiveness in artistic creation, virtual reality, and visual media applications.

Method: VMDiff uses a diffusion-based framework with: (1) hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation for structure-aware fusion; (2) adaptive adjustment module with similarity-based scoring to automatically find optimal parameters and counter semantic bias.

Result: Experiments on 780 concept pairs show VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff effectively addresses key challenges in multi-source image fusion through its hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment, achieving superior performance in generating coherent, balanced fused images.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

*Liubing Hu,Chen Wu,Anrui Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT is an end-to-end image enhancement model that combines the efficiency of 3D LUTs with flow matching to address the trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional 3D LUTs which lack representational flexibility and depend on fixed priors, while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

Method: Uses a collection of differentiable 3D LUTs with different priors, a lightweight content-aware fusion network for scene-adaptive color correction with O(1) complexity, and an iterative flow matching method to restore local details and eliminate artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on three benchmarks, achieving both computational efficiency and enhanced representational capacity.

Conclusion: FlowLUT successfully integrates LUT efficiency with flow matching to provide real-time image enhancement with improved flexibility and detail restoration.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel task of text-controlled human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects, introduces the InteractMove dataset, and presents a pipeline solution for physically plausible interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-scene interaction datasets have insufficient interaction categories and only consider interactions with static objects, while collecting datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.

Method: Uses 3D visual grounding to identify interaction objects, proposes hand-object joint affordance learning for contact region prediction, and optimizes interactions with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority in generating physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of movable human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes, enabling accurate object identification, diverse interaction learning, and collision-free physically plausible motions.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel segmentation approaches rely on supervised learning and extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography.

Method: Integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation strategy, directly modeling vascular structures with biostatistical coherence instead of pixel-based methods.

Result: Achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is a latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation that outperforms existing methods in glyph accuracy and style fidelity while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-online handwriting generation methods primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, leading to inefficiency and lack of holistic structural modeling for full text lines.

Method: Proposes DiffInk with two main components: InkVAE (sequential variational autoencoder with OCR-based and style-classification losses) and InkDiT (latent diffusion Transformer) that integrates target text and reference styles.

Result: Experimental results show DiffInk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in full-line handwriting generation.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction capability to Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models through Introspection Training and Recursive Inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDVLMs lack self-correction ability and cannot fix errors in generated tokens, limiting their reliability and accuracy.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Introspection Training with an Introspection Model to detect grammatical, spelling, and logical errors; 2) Recursive Inference with alternating unmask→introspection→remask process.

Result: RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed RIV framework successfully equips MDVLMs with self-correction capability through recursive introspection, significantly improving model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

TL;DR: FAMDA is a multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation framework that uses Vision Foundation Models as teachers to generate pseudo-labels for target domains, enabling efficient domain adaptation for semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task dense prediction suffers from domain shift in new environments, and existing multi-task UDA methods rely on adversarial learning which is less effective than self-training techniques.

Method: Leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as teachers in a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for target domains, distilling their capabilities into a single efficient student network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic-to-real UDA benchmarks and day-to-night adaptation, with lightweight variants being 10x smaller than foundation models while maintaining SOTA accuracy.

Conclusion: FAMDA enables training of highly efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for resource-constrained robotics applications through foundation model distillation.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

TL;DR: MotionVerse is a unified LLM-based framework for human motion understanding, generation, and editing in single/multi-person scenarios using motion tokenization and dual-tower architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive framework that leverages LLMs for human motion tasks while addressing challenges in motion representation, computational efficiency, and modality interference.

Method: Uses motion tokenizer with residual quantization, Delay Parallel Modeling for staggered encoding of token streams, and dual-tower architecture with modality-specific parameters.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: MotionVerse successfully demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively adapted for comprehensive human motion understanding and generation through careful architectural design.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair is a lightweight method that improves fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning text embeddings rather than full models, using distance-constrained debiasing and two-stage sampling to maintain generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fair T2I methods require heavy full-parameter training or auxiliary networks, causing high computational burden and unsatisfactory performance. The text encoder is identified as a key source of bias that needs targeted intervention.

Method: Fine-tunes text embeddings using collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy to balance embedding distances. Uses two-stage text-guided sampling to limit debiased encoder intervention and preserve generation quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art debiasing on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only 1/4 of training burden and virtually no increase in sampling burden. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: LightFair provides an effective and efficient solution for fair text-to-image generation by focusing on text encoder debiasing, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational costs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Result: EfficientMIL outperformed other MIL methods across multiple datasets: on TCGA-Lung, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC 0.976 and accuracy 0.933; on CAMELYON16, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC 0.990 and accuracy 0.975. APS was also more effective than conventional selection strategies.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while maintaining superior classification performance, demonstrating that linear-complexity sequence models can effectively replace quadratic attention mechanisms in MIL for whole slide image analysis.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

### [123] [From Static to Dynamic: a Survey of Topology-Aware Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23641)
*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey on topology-aware perception for autonomous driving, covering four research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception, highlighting a shift from static maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static maps are costly to build, hard to update in real-time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting scalability for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Systematic review of four core research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.

Result: Identifies a unifying trend of paradigm shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception, enabling real-time map construction and topology reasoning.

Conclusion: These research directions collectively enable more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

*Aryan Mikaeili,Amirhossein Alimohammadi,Negar Hassanpour,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free method for multi-image layout control using image references instead of text, enabling precise object placement and part-level composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models lack fine-grained control for precise object placement and layout, needing more explicit guidance than text alone can provide.

Method: Training-free approach that uses single image references per object, providing explicit control for object and part-level composition without requiring model retraining.

Result: Effectively demonstrates multi-image layout control across various composition tasks, enabling precise placement of objects specified through image references.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses layout control limitations of text-to-image models by using image-based references for explicit object placement guidance.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

### [125] [Sparse-Up: Learnable Sparse Upsampling for 3D Generation with High-Fidelity Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23646)
*Lu Xiao,Jiale Zhang,Yang Liu,Taicheng Huang,Xin Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient 3D texture modeling framework that preserves high-frequency details by using sparse voxels with surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to overcome resolution constraints while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D asset creation face a 'pixel-level pain point' where they either sacrifice cross-view consistency (causing torn/drifting textures) or remain limited by explicit voxel resolution constraints, losing fine texture details.

Method: Uses sparse voxels to guide texture reconstruction, with two key strategies: 1) Surface anchoring with learnable upsampling to constrain voxels to mesh surface (eliminating 70%+ redundant voxels), and 2) View-domain partitioning with image patch-guided voxel partitioning that supervises gradients only on visible local patches.

Result: Significantly reduces memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric consistency, while effectively preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up provides an effective solution for high-fidelity 3D texture modeling that breaks through resolution constraints while maintaining memory efficiency and preserving fine texture details.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

*Xingjian Yang,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for robust 6D pose estimation that combines initial pose estimation with fast motion-based tracking using shared lighting-invariant color-pair features, designed for efficient edge device execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust 6D pose estimation under difficult lighting conditions while maintaining the trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and real-time tracking efficiency, particularly for edge devices.

Method: Uses a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that enables robust registration for initial pose estimation between RGB-D views and 3D meshes, and validates temporal correspondences for lightweight motion regression in tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated approach is effective and robust, achieving competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking through abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully synergizes initial estimation and tracking through shared features, providing robust 6D pose estimation suitable for edge devices under challenging illumination conditions.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

*Congzhi Zhang,Zhibin Wang,Yinchao Ma,Jiawei Peng,Yihan Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWatch addresses the video reasoning gap in LVLMs by creating a large-scale dataset with multi-hop questions and video-grounded CoT data, and develops ReWatch-R1 model that achieves SOTA performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR has advanced image reasoning but video reasoning remains underdeveloped due to lack of challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality video-grounded CoT data.

Method: Created ReWatch dataset with multi-stage synthesis pipeline including Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, then developed ReWatch-R1 model using SFT and RLVR with novel O&R reward mechanism.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework successfully bridge the video reasoning gap in LVLMs by providing necessary data and effective training methodology.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables building competitive vision-language models efficiently, with plans to release LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL soon.

### [129] [HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23663)
*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free method that improves Vision-Language Models efficiency through hierarchical visual token pruning using middle-layer attention maps for importance scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from inefficient inference due to large numbers of visual tokens, many of which are unnecessary and can be pruned without performance loss.

Method: Uses attention maps from middle layers of vision encoder to estimate token importance, then applies hierarchical pruning: global stage retains important tokens per region, local stage keeps most important token per window.

Result: Reduces time-to-first-token by up to 55.1% and improves token generation throughput by up to 60.9% without accuracy loss, even achieving improvements on some benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP achieves superior accuracy and higher inference efficiency compared to prior works, demonstrating effective visual token pruning for VLM optimization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

*Xixi Jiang,Chen Yang,Dong Zhang,Pingcheng Dong,Xin Yang,Kwang-Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STIM-TM is a spatiotemporal token merging method that reduces computational costs for surgical video transformers by independently merging redundant tokens along temporal and spatial dimensions while preserving critical surgical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer methods for surgical video understanding suffer from high computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens, and existing token merging approaches fail to consider video structure and heterogeneous information distribution.

Method: STIM-TM uses a decoupled strategy: temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, while spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic regions with surgical information.

Result: Achieves over 65% GFLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across surgical video tasks, and enables efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM provides an effective training-free solution for computational efficiency in surgical video understanding while preserving performance, addressing key bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

TL;DR: RCI is a new metric that measures whether multimodal benchmarks require global reasoning or can be solved with local visual cues, revealing most current benchmarks favor localized reasoning with spatial biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks don't distinguish between genuine global reasoning and success via localized visual cues, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world model development.

Method: Introduces Region Comprehension Index (RCI) - a model-based score that systematically compares performance on image patches vs full images to quantify reliance on global vs local visual information.

Result: Application to 13 multimodal benchmarks showed most favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, posing risks for real-world applications.

Conclusion: RCI provides an actionable tool for diagnosing and mitigating biases, enabling construction of better datasets to develop robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Dayu Tan,Ziwei Zhang,Yansan Su,Xin Peng,Yike Dai,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework that uses bidirectional spatial perception and multi-scale self-distillation to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models have high computational complexity due to global attention mechanisms, making it challenging to balance performance and efficiency for complex segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes bidirectional spatial aware branch for capturing long-range spatial context dependencies and nonlinear feature extraction, combined with multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy for hierarchical feature representation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization while maintaining high computational efficiency on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses quadratic computational complexity limitations while improving global perception capabilities for volumetric segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse is a unified framework that combines model quantization and attention sparsification to efficiently compress diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant performance improvements and computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers have excellent video generation capabilities but suffer from high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment. While quantization and attention sparsification offer compression benefits, each alone causes severe performance degradation under aggressive compression.

Method: Proposes QuantSparse framework with two key components: 1) Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation using global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization bias, and 2) Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization that exploits temporal stability of second-order residuals to recover information lost under sparsity.

Result: On HunyuanVideo-13B, achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while delivering 3.68× storage reduction and 1.88× acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: QuantSparse successfully integrates quantization and sparsification to achieve compounded efficiency gains without severe performance degradation, making diffusion transformers more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

TL;DR: HomeSafeBench is a new benchmark for evaluating embodied agents' home safety inspection capabilities, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by providing dynamic first-person perspective images and enabling free exploration in simulated home environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of visual information and restrict agents to single static viewpoints, hindering accurate evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and causing omission of occluded safety hazards.

Method: Proposed HomeSafeBench with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety), providing dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments and allowing free exploration for multiple dynamic perspectives.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows even the best-performing VLM achieves only 10.23% F1-score, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs, particularly in identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench reveals substantial gaps in current VLM capabilities for home safety inspection and provides valuable reference for future research, with the dataset and code to be publicly available.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

TL;DR: Ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones using Weighted Boxes Fusion improves weapon detection robustness in surveillance systems, achieving 2.948% mAP improvement over single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public safety requires robust surveillance systems for weapon detection, but single-model detectors struggle with challenges like partial occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds.

Method: Used ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3) trained on weapon dataset, combined using Weighted Boxes Fusion with 'max' confidence scoring strategy.

Result: Achieved mAP of 0.838, representing 2.948% relative improvement over best single model, consistently outperforming other fusion heuristics.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is critical for ensemble performance, offering robust approach for real-time weapon detection in surveillance applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

### [136] [INSTINCT: Instance-Level Interaction Architecture for Query-Based Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23700)
*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT is a novel collaborative perception framework that improves multi-agent LiDAR-based detection while significantly reducing bandwidth requirements through instance-level interaction and quality-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative perception systems face bandwidth constraints due to frequent cooperative interactions and real-time requirements. While query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth demands, LiDAR-focused implementations remain underdeveloped and trail state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: INSTINCT features three core components: 1) quality-aware filtering for high-quality instance feature selection, 2) dual-branch detection routing to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances, and 3) Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Enhanced ground truth sampling facilitates training with diverse hybrid instance features.

Result: Extensive experiments show INSTINCT achieves superior performance with 13.23% improvement in DAIR-V2X and 33.08% in V2V4Real datasets, while reducing communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: INSTINCT successfully bridges the gap in LiDAR-focused collaborative perception by providing an efficient instance-level interaction architecture that significantly improves accuracy while dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Boseong Jeon,Junghyuk Lee,Jimin Park,Kwanyoung Kim,Jingi Jung,Sangwon Lee,Hyunbo Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion model that jointly handles object removal and insertion tasks using classifier-free guidance, enabling efficient object movement in a single denoising step without separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods handle object effects like shadows and reflections using counterfactual datasets, but the impact of classifier-free guidance on unified removal/insertion models remains unexplored. There's a need for more efficient composite editing.

Method: Jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single model, leverages classifier-free guidance to enhance object/effect removal and controllable effect synthesis, and extends task prompts to enable object movement in one denoising step.

Result: Extensive experiments show CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal/insertion stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit demonstrates that unified training with classifier-free guidance enables efficient composite image editing including removal, insertion, and movement operations within a single model framework.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

*Shuai Shao,Shu Jiang,Shiyuan Zhao,Di Yang,Yan Wang,Yutong Bai,Jianguo Zhang,Jiangtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net is an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease that uses MRI scans with clinical prior knowledge integration for improved accuracy and early detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease diagnostic workflows are complex, heavily reliant on neurologist expertise, and often result in delayed detection and missed early intervention opportunities.

Method: PD-Diag-Net integrates MRI preprocessing to reduce variability, incorporates two clinical priors (brain region relevance and aging patterns), and uses dedicated modules for feature aggregation and diagnosis based on these priors.

Result: The method achieves 86% accuracy on external hospital tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net provides an effective automated diagnostic solution for Parkinson's disease with high accuracy and clinical interpretability, particularly valuable for early detection.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN is a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion that uses depth image projection and denoising to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models have strong generative capabilities but remain underexplored for point cloud completion due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Project partial point clouds to depth images, use DepthLDM to generate completed multi-view depth images forming coarse point clouds; 2) Point Denoising Network removes artifacts and Association-Aware Point Upsampler refines with local association features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively leverages latent diffusion models for point cloud completion through a novel coarse-to-fine framework that handles the unstructured nature of point clouds while producing high-quality results.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, parameter-free visual prompting method that combines multiple video frames into single panel images to improve long-video understanding performance in Video-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-Language Models underperform on long-video tasks compared to image/short-video tasks, and existing solutions add complexity through fine-tuning with limited data.

Method: Proposes a visual prompting strategy that trades spatial details for temporal resolution by combining multiple frames as panels into one image, making it training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic.

Result: Achieves up to 19.4% accuracy improvement on TimeScope (Long) dataset, with consistent gains across 5 benchmarks and various model architectures, sizes, and context windows.

Conclusion: The method effectively raises performance bar for long video understanding without additional training or parameters, demonstrating the value of optimizing existing models rather than adding complexity.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation, containing 15,080 layouts and 258k object instances from real-world scans, CAD designs, and procedural generation, with detailed structured text annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout generation models are limited by small, low-diversity datasets with poor annotations. There's a need for a comprehensive dataset to enable learning of complex spatial and semantic patterns for text-driven 3D scene generation.

Method: Created M3DLayout dataset by integrating three sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout includes structured text describing global scene summaries, furniture relationships, and fine-grained object arrangements. Evaluated using a text-conditioned diffusion model benchmark.

Result: The dataset enables training of effective layout generation models. The multi-source composition enhances diversity, particularly through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich small-object information for generating more complex and detailed scenes.

Conclusion: M3DLayout serves as a valuable resource for advancing text-driven 3D scene synthesis research by providing a large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated dataset that overcomes limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUQ is a novel layerwise ultra-low bit quantization method for multimodal LLMs that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to resilient layers, reducing memory usage by 31-40% compared to 4-bit models with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs require huge memory and computational resources, but existing post-training quantization methods for language models are not effective for multimodal models due to higher statistical variance in multimodal tokens.

Method: Proposes LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which analyzes activation distributions across layers and selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers with lower entropy distributions that are more resilient. Also uses mixed multimodal tokens for PTQ.

Result: LUQ reduces memory usage by 40% for LLaVA-1.5 and 31% for Qwen-2.5-VL compared to 4-bit models, with performance degradation less than 10% on MME benchmark across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective quantization based on activation entropy analysis enables effective ultra-low bit compression for multimodal LLMs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok is a multi-scale Vision Transformer tokenizer that uses multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to improve image reconstruction and generation by enabling progressive information flow from global semantics to structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of single-scale representations in Vision Transformer tokenizers, which cannot effectively capture both global semantic features and high-resolution structural details simultaneously.

Method: Uses two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling on token maps to produce multi-scale tokens, and (2) scale-causal attention mechanism that enables progressive information flow from low-resolution to high-resolution features.

Result: Achieves 27.2% improvement in rFID (1.47 → 1.07), 1.38× faster convergence rate, and 18.9% boost in gFID (16.4 → 13.3). With scaled training, achieves state-of-the-art rFID of 0.45 and gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers.

Conclusion: HieraTok is the first multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer that significantly advances visual generation tasks through its multi-scale architecture and progressive attention mechanism, creating smoother latent spaces.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency in scene reconstruction.

Method: Uses sequential input with metric-scale point cloud estimation in global coordinates, employs transformer-based gated update module for spatial memory, partitions scene into submaps with local alignment, and registers all submaps into common world frame.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency mechanisms for improved dense visual SLAM.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ResAD++ framework for class-agnostic anomaly detection that learns residual feature distributions and uses feature hypersphere constraints to achieve better generalization across diverse new classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods perform poorly on new classes because their representation learning remains class-related through feature correlation. There's a need for a class-agnostic approach that can generalize to diverse new domains without retraining.

Method: Uses residual features by subtracting normal reference features to achieve feature decorrelation. Introduces feature hypersphere constraints to address scale correlation. Enhanced with logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization-based feature distribution matching (ResAD++).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show ResAD++ achieves remarkable anomaly detection results when directly applied to new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and the original ResAD.

Conclusion: ResAD++ effectively addresses class-agnostic anomaly detection by learning residual feature distributions and constraining feature scales, enabling strong generalization to diverse new classes without retraining.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Poivre, a self-refining procedure that enables vision-language models to iteratively refine visual pointing coordinates through reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Point-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models perform poorly on visual pointing tasks compared to humans, mainly because they are required to complete pointing in a single step without iterative refinement.

Method: Proposed Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre) procedure using reinforcement learning with a process reward to enable iterative coordinate refinement.

Result: Poivre-7B achieves state-of-the-art on Point-Bench, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models like Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: The self-refining procedure with RL training effectively improves visual pointing accuracy, bridging the gap between VLM and human performance.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Result: Achieves Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and mIoU of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution datasets, demonstrating real-time accurate performance suitable for clinical applications.

Conclusion: PVTAdpNet provides superior polyp segmentation performance with high accuracy metrics, making it highly suitable for clinical deployment in colorectal cancer detection.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

*Xinyang Song,Libin Wang,Weining Wang,Shaozhen Liu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Qi Li,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAlignment is a unified multimodal generation framework using a single diffusion transformer with dual-stream training for better cross-modal consistency and instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal tasks rely on fragmented architectures using vision-language models or modular designs, leading to computational inefficiency and poor semantic alignment.

Method: Proposes UniAlignment with dual-stream diffusion training incorporating intrinsic-modal and cross-modal semantic alignment within a single diffusion transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines across multiple tasks and benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal semantic consistency.

Conclusion: UniAlignment shows significant potential for diffusion models in unified multimodal generation, achieving better cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

### [150] [GenView++: Unifying Adaptive View Generation and Quality-Driven Supervision for Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23770)
*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ is a unified framework that improves contrastive learning through multi-source adaptive view generation and quality-driven contrastive learning, achieving significant performance gains in both vision and vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods face limitations in constructing diverse and semantically coherent positive pairs, and lack mechanisms to assess pair quality, leading to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.

Method: Introduces two innovations: 1) Multi-source adaptive view generation that synthesizes diverse yet semantically coherent views using image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies; 2) Quality-driven contrastive learning that assesses semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight training contributions.

Result: Improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification; raises zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets; improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively addresses both construction and learning challenges in contrastive learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse vision and vision-language tasks through its unified framework.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

### [151] [A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772)
*Yaya Zhao,Kaiqi Zhao,Zixuan Tang,Zhiyuan Liu,Xiaoling Lu,Yalei Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR is a modality-tailored graph framework for urban region representation that addresses limitations of existing approaches by using specialized GNN architectures for different modality types and spatially-aware multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models use identical architectures across all modalities and neglect spatial heterogeneity in fusion, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: Categorizes modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups, uses MoE GNN for aggregated modalities and dual-level GNN for point-level modality, implements spatially-aware multimodal fusion with dynamic weights, and employs joint contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks show MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MTGRR effectively addresses modality-specific characteristics and spatial heterogeneity in urban region representation learning.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

### [152] [Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction for Generative Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23774)
*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TVQ&RAP, a generative super-resolution model that addresses limitations in existing VQ-based methods through texture vector-quantization and reconstruction-aware prediction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based methods have large quantization errors due to visual signal richness and use code-level supervision that ignores final reconstruction errors, leading to sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy.

Method: Proposes two strategies: 1) Texture vector-quantization that only models missing textures' prior, and 2) Reconstruction aware prediction using straight-through estimator with image-level supervision.

Result: The model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with small computational cost.

Conclusion: TVQ&RAP effectively addresses quantization errors and supervision limitations in VQ-based visual prior modeling for super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

*Nayeong Kim,Seong Joon Oh,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupCoOp is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses group-specific text prompts to address spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art group robustness with minimal parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuned vision-language models are vulnerable to spurious correlations caused by subgroup imbalance in training datasets, which leads to poor performance on minority groups.

Method: Proposes Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp) that employs group-specific text prompts as group representatives, using the VLM's text encoder to discover effective prompts even for small groups, addressing class distribution issues.

Result: Achieved best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures, occasionally outperforming full-network fine-tuning methods while training only 0.016% of parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively enhances group robustness in vision-language models through group-specific prompts, providing superior debiasing performance with extreme parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to identify and repair unstable levels generated by PCG models using Angry Birds as a case study, leveraging object segmentation and visual analysis to detect structural gaps and improve level stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content from PCG techniques remains challenging, as existing models often produce unstable levels that need repair.

Method: Uses object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps, evaluates multiple segmentation models, and performs targeted repairs on unstable levels.

Result: Experimental results show the method improves stability and playability of AI-generated levels in Angry Birds.

Conclusion: The image-based approach is designed to be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures, despite being evaluated specifically on Angry Birds.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

TL;DR: A controllable framework for generating large-scale 3D vector urban layouts that combines geometric and semantic conditioning to create realistic urban models with user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations - image-based approaches lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods miss parcel semantics. There's a need for methods that can generate large-scale 3D urban layouts with both structural relations and semantic understanding.

Method: Fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, and embeds building height in graph representations to extend 2D layouts to realistic 3D structures. Allows direct user control through semantic attribute modification.

Result: The method successfully produces valid, large-scale urban models that maintain geometric continuity and incorporate semantic understanding.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective tool for data-driven urban planning and design, offering controllable generation of realistic 3D urban layouts at scale.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view quality control system using three cameras and image fusion to detect improperly fastened small assembly parts like screws, overcoming limitations of single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality control methods using single-view imaging or manual inspection are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, and lighting inconsistencies, requiring additional inspection stations that disrupt assembly lines.

Method: Integrated multi-camera imaging system with three camera views and advanced object detection algorithms, using tailored image fusion methodology to combine results from multiple views.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in identifying improperly fastened small assembly parts.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that overcomes single-view limitations and ensures assembly line reliability and safety.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines AI models' understanding of privacy, introduces a Visual Privacy Taxonomy, and evaluates Vision-Language Models' privacy comprehension capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs and VLMs show impressive capabilities, they lack understanding of privacy principles. There's a need to determine if these models can understand and enforce privacy, especially given limited testing resources.

Method: Developed a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that captures privacy issues and is scalable for future research. Evaluated several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models to assess their privacy understanding.

Result: Revealed significant inconsistencies in VLMs' understanding of contextual privacy. Current models demonstrate limitations in grasping privacy concepts despite their advanced capabilities in other areas.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems. The work provides both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a critical benchmark of current model limitations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

### [158] [Uni4D-LLM: A Unified SpatioTemporal-Aware VLM for 4D Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23828)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM is the first unified vision-language model framework that jointly handles 4D scene understanding and generation through spatiotemporal-aware visual representations and a shared Transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D/4D approaches use separate models for understanding (autoregressive) and generation (diffusion), creating a paradigm gap that prevents unified handling of both tasks in dynamic 4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is crucial.

Method: Extracts semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporates 4D geometric cues, fuses them via adaptive cross-attention into spatiotemporal-aware visual representations, and integrates both tasks into a single LLM with task-specific heads.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM successfully bridges the paradigm gap between understanding and generation in 4D scenes through unified representations and architecture, enabling joint handling of both tasks within a single framework.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the zero-shot performance of the Segment Concept (SeC) framework on the challenging MOSEv2 dataset for semi-supervised video object segmentation, achieving 39.7 JFn and ranking 2nd place in the Complex VOS track.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for semi-supervised video object segmentation rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and lack robustness against challenges like visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts due to insufficient high-level conceptual understanding of the target.

Method: Uses the Segment Concept (SeC) framework which employs a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish deep semantic understanding of objects for more persistent segmentation, evaluated in zero-shot setting without fine-tuning.

Result: SeC achieved 39.7 JFn on the MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: The SeC framework demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on complex video object segmentation tasks by leveraging semantic understanding through LVLMs, showing promise for robust segmentation despite challenging conditions.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional Text-to-3D quality assessment, and proposes Rank2Score, a two-stage training method that outperforms existing metrics and can serve as a reward function for generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-3D quality assessment faces challenges including outdated benchmarks, fragmented datasets, and limitations in current objective metrics that result in non-representative feature extraction and reduced robustness.

Method: The authors create T23D-CompBench with 5 components and 12 sub-components for compositional prompts, generating 3,600 textured meshes from 10 state-of-the-art models. They collect 129,600 human ratings and propose Rank2Score with two-stage training: supervised contrastive regression with curriculum learning in stage 1, and mean opinion score refinement in stage 2.

Result: Extensive experiments show Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can effectively serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed T23D-CompBench benchmark and Rank2Score evaluator provide a comprehensive solution for Text-to-3D quality assessment, achieving better alignment with human judgments and demonstrating practical utility in downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: Proposes CE-FAM, a concept-based explanation method that identifies what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions correspond to them, and how they contribute to predictions, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps only highlight important regions without explaining their meaning, while concept-based explanations lack comprehensive methods that simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their regions, and contributions to predictions.

Method: Uses a branched network sharing activation maps with an image classifier to mimic VLM embeddings, predicts concepts via weighted sum of activation maps using gradient-based weights, and quantifies contributions based on impact on classification scores.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, and provides a general framework for concept region identification without requiring annotated datasets.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully addresses the limitations of existing explanation methods by providing comprehensive concept-based explanations that reveal learned concepts, their regions, and contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge for arbitrary concepts.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen

Motivation: To address limitations in current FBP models including architectural constraints (CNNs struggle with global harmony, ViTs miss fine details), demographic biases, and lack of transparency in existing methods.

Method: Proposes FairViT-GAN - a hybrid framework with CNN branch for local feature extraction and ViT branch for global context modeling, plus adversarial debiasing mechanism to make representations invariant to protected attributes.

Result: Achieves Pearson Correlation of 0.9230 and RMSE of 0.2650 on SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, with 82.9% reduction in performance gap between ethnic subgroups and adversary classification accuracy dropping to 52.1% (near-random chance).

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI systems for subjective visual assessment.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR improves temporal sentence grounding by addressing query conflicts in DETR through constrained self-attention and query-to-frame alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR enhancement strategies degrade performance in temporal sentence grounding due to query conflicts from similar target moments and internal conflicts between global semantics and local localization.

Method: Extends standard DETR with two modifications: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on semantic and positional overlap, and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge global and local contexts.

Result: Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: A simple yet powerful baseline that addresses fundamental query conflict issues in DETR for temporal sentence grounding tasks.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) addresses information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention, improving image quality and semantic faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which scatters guidance signals and leads to ambiguous, unfaithful features.

Method: Proposed Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention, adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling to maintain alignment between guidance and content.

Result: IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Conclusion: IGG effectively addresses the critical weakness of information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation, ensuring guidance and content remain tightly aligned for improved image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

TL;DR: PCRI is a new metric to measure MLLM robustness to visual context changes, showing most models are brittle to background noise with only a few exceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics don't capture MLLM sensitivity to irrelevant visual context, undermining reliability in real-world settings.

Method: Introduces PCRI score that systematically quantifies performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input across 19 MLLMs and 15 benchmarks.

Result: Most leading models remain brittle to background noise, with only InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B showing consistent robustness. PCRI reveals how different architectures handle visual context.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness for principled model selection and guides development of more robust architectures and training strategies.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and

### [166] [Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880)
*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised 3D object detection framework with learnable pseudo-labeling that automatically selects high-quality pseudo-labels using context-adaptive thresholds and score fusion networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing SS3DOD methods that manually set confidence thresholds and overlook contextual information when selecting pseudo-labels, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a learnable pseudo-labeling module with two networks at teacher output level that assess pseudo-label quality via score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds supervised by GT bounding box alignment. Includes soft supervision strategy for robust learning under label noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining wider context coverage and higher recall, significantly improving SS3DOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses pseudo-label selection challenges in SS3DOD by leveraging learnable adaptive thresholds and robust supervision, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [167] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperDiff is a self-supervised tunable-generalization diffusion method for low-dose CT denoising that requires only LDCT projection data and achieves superior reconstruction and generalization across different doses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for low-dose CT denoising rely on paired data and generalize poorly, while diffusion models need clean data distribution which is hard to obtain in clinical settings. Self-supervised methods also struggle with generalizability across different dose levels.

Method: Uses contextual sub-data similarity adaptive sensing for projection domain denoising, combines knowledge distillation with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, and employs pixel-level self-correcting fusion for image domain refinement. The method is self-supervised and works with only LDCT projection data.

Result: SuperDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on datasets and real data, showing superior reconstruction and generalization performance across different dose levels.

Conclusion: The proposed SuperDiff method effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing a self-supervised, tunable-generalization solution for low-dose CT denoising that works with only projection domain data and maintains strong performance across various dose scenarios.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X is the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, showing that joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack kinematic-level annotations for both hands and body in bimanual activities, and marker-based systems introduce visual artifacts limiting generalization to natural videos.

Method: Constructed a pipeline combining multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos, then validated different input representations across action recognition models.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines, and joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone.

Conclusion: Modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics is crucial for holistic understanding of bimanual activities, highlighting the importance of hand-body coordination in action recognition.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCU is a cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems by selectively removing visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and maintaining structural stability of retained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual modality is most vulnerable to privacy leakage in multimodal applications, and existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability during visual unlearning.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) with three components: selective visual unlearning using inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention through semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show CCU achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems while maintaining performance across modalities through selective unlearning and cross-modal knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Motivation: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text understanding remains a major challenge in healthcare AI, needing improved accuracy and explainability.

Method: Uses Fast Fourier Transform to shift image/text features to frequency domain for noise filtering, combined with quantum-inspired retrieval system to fetch medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques.

Result: Outperforms earlier models on VQA-RAD dataset, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning, with improved performance and explainability.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors by combining frequency and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models need to adapt over time, but full retraining is often prevented by privacy constraints and high costs, requiring a solution that enables continual learning without storing patient exemplars.

Method: Pairs class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, evaluated across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert dataset.

Result: Achieves 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert, reduces forgetting by more than 30% relative to DER++, and approaches joint training performance (0.869 AUROC) while remaining efficient and privacy-preserving.

Conclusion: Provides a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models by combining replay diffusion and synaptic stability through measurable factors like replay fidelity and Fisher weighted parameter drift.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: FedDA is a federated domain adaptation framework for cross-domain medical image segmentation that uses feature-level adversarial learning to align feature maps across clients, enabling single modality clients to process cross-modality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of modality heterogeneity in federated learning for medical imaging, where different clients have different medical image modalities due to resource imbalance or data issues.

Method: Propose feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps through embedding an adversarial training mechanism to enhance model generalization across domains.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets show FedDA achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, gives single modality clients cross-modality processing capabilities, and outperforms state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms.

Conclusion: FedDA successfully addresses modality heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation through domain adaptation, enabling robust cross-modality processing while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces EditReward-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating reward models in instruction-guided image editing, and develops EditScore reward models that enable effective reinforcement learning for image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-guided image editing models struggle with complex instructions and require multiple samples. Reinforcement learning offers promise but lacks high-fidelity reward signals.

Method: Developed EditReward-Bench benchmark and EditScore reward models (7B-72B) through meticulous data curation. Used self-ensemble strategy and applied RL framework to OmniGen2 base model.

Result: EditScore matches proprietary VLM performance, with largest variant surpassing GPT-5. Enables efficient RL policy optimization and substantial performance uplift in final model.

Conclusion: High-fidelity, domain-specialized reward models are key to unlocking RL's full potential in image editing, providing systematic path from benchmarking to RL training.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

<details>

Motivation: Existing methods for human reaction generation either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely solely on one person's motion, failing to integrate rich semantic information and lacking adaptive responsiveness to diverse interaction scenarios.

Method: Proposes MoReact, a diffusion-based method that sequentially disentangles global trajectory generation and local motion generation. Introduces a novel interaction loss to enhance realism of close interactions, using data adapted from a two-person motion dataset.

Result: The approach demonstrates efficacy in producing realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match counterpart movements while adhering to textual guidance.

Conclusion: MoReact successfully addresses limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation, achieving better alignment with given actions and text through sequential generation of trajectories and motions.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

### [177] [Revisit the Imbalance Optimization in Multi-task Learning: An Experimental Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23915)
*Yihang Guo,Tianyuan Yu,Liang Bai,Yanming Guo,Yirun Ruan,William Li,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning suffers from optimization imbalance where task interference reduces performance. Analysis shows gradient norm correlates with imbalance, and scaling losses by gradient norms achieves comparable results to expensive grid searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the persistent problem of unbalanced optimization in multi-task learning, where task interference leads to suboptimal performance compared to single-task models.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis examining factors contributing to optimization imbalance, including testing existing optimization methods across datasets, evaluating Vision Foundation Models, and analyzing gradient dynamics.

Result: Found strong correlation between optimization imbalance and task-specific gradient norms. Demonstrated that scaling task losses according to gradient norms achieves performance comparable to computationally expensive grid searches.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics provides a more direct path to stable multi-task learning than developing complex methods, with gradient norm-based loss scaling offering an effective and efficient solution.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes adversarial example transfer across tasks in CLIP models, finding that fine-grained tasks generate more transferable attacks. The authors propose MT-AdvCLIP framework that improves cross-task attack success by 39% without increasing perturbation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP shows strong generalization but struggles with fine-grained tasks and its adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Understanding cross-task adversarial transfer is crucial for assessing CLIP's security risks and generalization limits.

Method: Proposed MT-AdvCLIP framework with task-aware feature aggregation loss to generate perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability, strengthening attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on shared CLIP backbone.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves adversarial transfer success rate (average attack success rate across multiple tasks improved by over 39%) against various CLIP-derived models without increasing perturbation budget.

Conclusion: The study reveals adversarial example transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models and provides new insights for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

### [179] [Token Painter: Training-Free Text-Guided Image Inpainting via Mask Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23919)
*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Painter is a training-free text-guided image inpainting method using Mask AutoRegressive models that addresses background consistency and text alignment through dual-stream encoder fusion and adaptive decoder attention enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods struggle with text alignment and background consistency in image inpainting due to modeling the entire image in latent space. MAR models offer better local controllability but need improvement for text guidance.

Method: Proposes Token Painter with two components: Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) that fuses text and background information in frequency domain, and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) that enhances attention on guidance and inpainting tokens.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The training-free Token Painter method effectively addresses text alignment and background consistency issues in text-guided image inpainting using MAR models with novel fusion and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation framework for autonomous driving that integrates real-world traffic scenarios from infrastructure sensors into CARLA simulator using digital twins of 15 intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA benchmarks use manually configured scenarios that diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance.

Method: Extracted 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from 100-hour video dataset captured by infrastructure sensors, and created static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance in CARLA.

Result: Created a challenging evaluation framework that accurately replicates real-world traffic and environmental characteristics, enabling more realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models with diverse driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

### [181] [Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23926)
*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to recover encoding-decoding direction pairs in deep vision networks, where concepts are represented as directions in latent space. Encoding directions combine concepts into latent representations, while decoding directions recover concept presence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black box of deep networks by understanding how they represent concepts as directions in latent space, enabling model understanding, debugging, and improvement through concept unlearning and intervention.

Method: Identifies decoding directions via directional clustering of activations, estimates encoding directions with signal vectors under a probabilistic view, and uses Uncertainty Region Alignment to reveal interpretable directions affecting predictions.

Result: On synthetic data, recovers ground-truth direction pairs; on real data, decoding directions map to monosemantic concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding directions.

Conclusion: The method enables understanding global model behavior, explaining individual predictions, and producing counterfactuals or correcting errors through concept intervention.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal AI methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling SAR imagery which has all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities crucial for remote sensing scene understanding.

Method: Proposes SAR-KnowLIP with: (1) SAR-GEOVL-1M dataset with geographic projection properties covering 120,000 images and 135 cities; (2) Hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought for multi-dimensional semantic annotations; (3) Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism for cross-modal alignment; (4) Unified evaluation benchmark across 11 downstream tasks.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance compared to 14 foundation models, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification tasks.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance SAR multimodal baseline model development.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

### [183] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune is a training-free framework that adaptively prunes visual tokens in vision-language models based on sample and task complexity, achieving 76.8% FLOPs reduction while retaining 96.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods use fixed schedules that don't align with the model's reasoning trajectory, failing to accommodate diverse input complexities. Human visual processing shows evidence accumulation before focus narrowing, suggesting adaptive pruning is needed.

Method: AutoPrune quantifies mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this to budget-constrained logistic retention curves that adapt to different task complexities while maintaining computational constraints.

Result: Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, AutoPrune prunes 89% of visual tokens, reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% original accuracy across tasks, outperforming PDrop by 9.1%.

Conclusion: Complexity-adaptive pruning effectively reduces computational demands while maintaining performance, demonstrating the importance of aligning pruning strategies with model reasoning patterns.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: A novel 3D car damage detection pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting for single-view segmentation, enabling accurate damage assessment from limited views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto insurance industry needs faster, accurate damage assessments. Current methods mostly use 2D images, but 3D reconstruction can provide more comprehensive geometric accuracy. 3D-GS shows promise for accurate reconstructions from limited views.

Method: Propose automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Use learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation: project Gaussians to image plane using SfM camera parameters, filter using Z-buffering with normal distribution model of depth and opacities.

Result: Method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection where target objects (scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables accurate 3D damage segmentation from single views, addressing practical limitations of multi-view methods in real-world car damage assessment scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: The proposed ColLab framework enables fully automated REC and REG data generation without human supervision, addressing scalability issues of manual annotation while producing high-quality, discriminative expressions.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and

significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in

TL;DR: RLIR is a post-training framework that uses inverse dynamics models to derive verifiable reward signals from generated videos, improving action-following capability in video world models without requiring expensive preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models have improved visual quality but struggle with accurately modeling human-specified actions. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches are impractical due to high costs of preference annotations and inability to construct rule-based video verifiers.

Method: Proposes RLIR framework that uses an Inverse Dynamics Model to recover input actions from generated videos, mapping high-dimensional video to low-dimensional action space to provide verifiable rewards optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Achieves 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR establishes the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, providing an effective solution to the action modeling challenge.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFSI enforces physical constraints in diffusion-based traffic simulators through energy-based guidance during sampling, reducing collisions by 67% and improving validity by 87% without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for traffic simulation systematically violate physical constraints, with 50% of trajectories having issues like collisions, off-road driving, and building spawns, treating physical validity as emergent rather than required.

Method: Proposes Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) that uses energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, guiding denoising toward physically valid trajectories.

Result: Across 200 urban scenarios, VFSI reduced collision rates from 24.6% to 8.1% (67% reduction) and improved overall validity from 50.3% to 94.2% (87% improvement), while also improving realism metrics (ADE from 1.34m to 1.21m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, and the model-agnostic VFSI approach effectively achieves this without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS is an efficient one-step diffusion model with attention specialization for real-world video super-resolution that reduces computational redundancy while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct adaptation of diffusion models to video super-resolution creates redundancy since low-quality videos already contain substantial content information, leading to increased computational overhead and learning burden.

Method: Proposes attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors, and a progressive training strategy starting with temporally consistent degradations then shifting to inconsistent settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with 6.2× speedup over one-step diffusion baselines like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS effectively mitigates redundancy in diffusion models for VSR while preserving pretrained knowledge, enabling better adaptation and superior inference speed.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPG360 is a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that uses perspective foundation models and graph optimization to achieve consistent depth estimation across cubemap faces without requiring labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has created a need for robust depth estimation techniques, but obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge.

Method: Converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, uses a perspective foundation model to estimate depth and surface normals, and introduces a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization with per-face scale parameters to ensure consistency across cubemap faces.

Result: Achieves superior performance across diverse datasets (Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, 360Loc) and demonstrates benefits in downstream tasks: feature matching (3.2-5.4% improvement) and Structure from Motion (0.2-9.7% improvement in AUC@5).

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method leveraging foundation models and graph optimization provides robust 360 monocular depth estimation with consistent performance across datasets and benefits for downstream computer vision tasks.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven simulators rely on supervised learning but suffer from distributional shift between training and testing, which undermines model generalization in unseen environments.

Method: Proposes SMART-R1 with metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm and iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for next-token prediction models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with overall realism meta score of 0.7858 on Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge, ranking first on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: The R1-style training framework is simple yet powerful for enhancing foundation models in multi-agent traffic simulation, effectively addressing distributional shift issues.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the

Motivation: Coronary angiography is invasive and resource-intensive, causing diagnostic delays and postponed treatment for ACS patients. A non-invasive alternative is needed for timely patient triage.

Method: Multimodal deep learning framework integrating echocardiography videos and clinical records using tabular-guided cross-attention and late fusion mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms unimodal and non-fused baselines with 67.6% balanced accuracy, 71.1% AUROC, and 88.6% cross-modality agreement for intervention prediction.

Conclusion: TREAT-Net shows potential as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate ACS patient triage, especially beneficial for underserved populations with limited angiography access.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

Method: Created a new annotated dataset using the NICO robotic platform and evaluated four state-of-the-art gaze estimation models.

Result: Angular errors were comparable to general-purpose benchmarks, but when converted to distance in shared workspace, the best median error was 16.48 cm, highlighting practical limitations.

terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via text when generating 3D head avatars from single images.

Method: Fuses identity features from images with semantic text embeddings through a novel conditioning scheme, and introduces a perceptual expression loss using a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize generation.

Result: Significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: SIE3D provides an effective framework for generating expressive 3D avatars with detailed text-based expression control while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameMind is a reinforcement learning framework that enables dynamic frame sampling for video understanding, allowing models to adaptively request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models use fixed frame sampling strategies, which limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence for tasks requiring either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: Uses Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) for multi-turn reasoning, alternating between textual reasoning and active visual perception. Employs Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) and DRFS-GRPO policy optimization algorithm to train dynamic sampling policies without frame-level annotations.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing models on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME, advancing state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: FrameMind demonstrates that dynamic, adaptive frame sampling through reinforcement learning enables more effective video understanding compared to static sampling approaches.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes the first generalized category discovery framework for hyperspectral images using prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors instead of single prototypes, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods designed for RGB images don't generalize well to hyperspectral images due to their high-dimensional nature and complex spectral structures, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Uses prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors per category, enforced by basis orthogonality for inter-class separability and reconstruction constraints to ensure effective sample representation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods on real-world HSI datasets, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings.

Conclusion: The proposed subspace-based prototype modeling effectively addresses the unique challenges of hyperspectral images in GCD, providing a more expressive and discriminative representation than single-prototype approaches.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze mitigation, adaptive Mamba variant for feature extraction, and heterogeneous graph attention network with spatio-temporal fusion for pedestrian relationship modeling.

Result: Reduces minADE/minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5% respectively compared to SOTA in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), with 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba.

Conclusion: Provides a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse

TL;DR: Learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior image reconstruction compared to post-ISP sRGB images, as demonstrated through rain removal tasks using a new benchmark and color-invariant metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial, but most networks use post-ISP sRGB images which irreversibly mix colors, clip dynamic range, and blur fine detail. The paper aims to show these losses are avoidable by working directly with raw data.

Method: Evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, curate Raw-Rain benchmark (first public benchmark of real rainy scenes in 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB), and introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS) as a color-invariant metric.

Result: Raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half the GFLOPs on the test split.

Conclusion: Results advocate for an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines by working directly with raw Bayer data.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end

TL;DR: A unified end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering for hyperspectral images, using a feedback mechanism between a self-representation network and differentiable superpixel module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing superpixel-based methods that perform segmentation independently of clustering, resulting in partitions misaligned with clustering objectives, and to overcome the high computational costs of subspace clustering for hyperspectral images.

Method: A unified framework with joint optimization of superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering, featuring a feedback mechanism where a self-representation network based on unfolded ADMM guides a differentiable superpixel module. The superpixel network learns unique compactness parameters for each superpixel.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show the method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches, producing clustering-aware partitions that preserve spectral and spatial structure.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization framework effectively addresses the misalignment between segmentation and clustering, enabling more flexible and adaptive segmentation while achieving better clustering performance for hyperspectral images.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

TL;DR: Pruning pre-trained vision models on one task preserves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning can recover performance on held-out tasks due to favorable loss landscapes from pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of pruning pre-trained vision models when downstream tasks are unknown, investigating how data influences pruning and whether task-specific data is necessary.

Method: Pruning-at-Initialization approach applied to pre-trained vision models, analyzing pruning on one task and evaluating performance on both seen and unseen tasks with and without fine-tuning.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning pruned models improves performance on original tasks while recovering performance on held-out tasks.

Conclusion: Extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets creates favorable loss landscapes that enable effective pruning without requiring task-specific data, making pruning practical even when downstream tasks are unknown.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Motivation: To understand why simple visual structures improve LVLM performance and uncover the internal mechanisms behind these gains.

Method: Used representation analysis to identify Grounding IDs in embedding space and conducted causal interventions to verify their role in object binding.

Result: Found that Grounding IDs create robust within-partition alignment, reduce modality gap, mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues, and strengthen attention between related components.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs are a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical robustness improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR challenges the frame-by-frame paradigm in video generation by introducing spatiotemporal cubes as prediction units, enabling autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question whether frames are the appropriate atomic units for video autoregression, as unlike words in language, frames may not be universally agreed upon as the natural prediction unit.

Method: Proposes VideoAR framework supporting multiple prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes, with cube-based prediction allowing simultaneous spatial and temporal processing.

Result: Cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on VBench with faster inference and scaling to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: The work motivates rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains by removing the frame-by-frame constraint.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Motivation: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities is challenging in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses rectified flow for deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with music features and LLM-based text decompositions. Includes contrastive objective and synchronization loss.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks.

Conclusion: DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed SVAC model effectively addresses computational challenges in RVOS while improving segmentation performance through scaled inputs and efficient compression strategies.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS is a coarse-to-fine framework that combines general vision-language models as 'Scanner' and specialized GUI grounding models as 'Locator' to improve GUI grounding performance by 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding natural language queries in GUIs is challenging due to diverse UI elements across applications and the need for precise spatial coordinate prediction.

Method: GMS uses a synergistic framework where general VLMs scan for regions of interest and fine-tuned grounding models locate precise coordinates within those regions, mimicking human visual processing.

Result: While individual components achieve only 2.0% and 3.7% accuracy, GMS achieves 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, representing a 10x improvement over standalone models.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates robust performance and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding by effectively leveraging complementary strengths of general and specialized models.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and expose ethnicity-based bias in AI facial beauty prediction systems, warning about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while seeking pathways toward equitable beauty technologies.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validation on the balanced FairFace dataset.

Result: Both models showed significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001), with only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfying distributional parity criteria, demonstrating algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate in addressing bias, and mitigation strategies are needed to develop more equitable beauty technologies that don't perpetuate societal biases.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models show strong performance in video super-resolution, existing one-step models still have room for optimization in inference efficiency despite reducing sampling steps to one.

Method: Proposes FastVSR with high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16), uses pixel shuffle and channel replication for upsampling, and implements lower-bound-guided training strategy for stable convergence.

Result: Achieves 111.9x speedup compared to multi-step models and 3.92x speedup compared to existing one-step models while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: FastVSR demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in video super-resolution through high compression VAE and stable training framework, making diffusion models more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

TL;DR: LatXGen is a generative framework that synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images, enabling radiation-free sagittal spinal alignment assessment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for AIS assessment lack reliable radiation-free evaluation of sagittal alignment, which is crucial for comprehensive three-dimensional spinal deformity assessment.

Method: Dual-stage architecture with attention-based FFC module for anatomical feature integration and Spatial Deformation Network for modeling lateral morphological variations, trained on a large paired dataset of 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs.

Result: LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing trajectory matching approaches by considering intermediate optimization states, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving medical image analysis.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning method for fine-grained image classification that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity to select the most informative samples under limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in fine-grained image classification is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences, making it difficult to assess sample informativeness effectively.

Method: DECERN uses a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty (quantifying category directionality and structural stability) and calibration diversity (uncertainty-weighted clustering to diversify samples while maintaining local representativeness).

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 experimental settings show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DECERN effectively addresses the challenges of active learning in fine-grained image classification by combining uncertainty and diversity measures to select high-value samples.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in obtaining large medical datasets and overcome limitations of existing generative models in output diversity for 3D medical images.

Method: GAN-based model for tumor mask generation and diffusion-based approach for tumor texture generation, both conditioned on radiomics features.

Result: Successfully generated tumor images in four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) across CT and MRI modalities. Synthesized images effectively aided downstream task training and passed expert authenticity evaluations.

Conclusion: The method enables flexible tumor manipulation and generation, has potential for treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors, and helps physicians visualize tumors according to changing radiomics features.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.

Result: Experimental results on OmniLabel benchmark show 24% performance improvement, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed linguistic compositionality approach.

Conclusion: The TaSe framework strengthens hierarchical linguistic structure bias, enabling fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection and highlighting the importance of linguistic compositionality in VLMs.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

### [218] [An Efficient 3D Latent Diffusion Model for T1-contrast Enhanced MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24194)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D deep learning framework called T1C-RFlow generates synthetic T1-contrast enhanced MRI images from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI, eliminating the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents while achieving high-quality results faster than conventional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in T1w MRI have limitations including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risks and imaging inconsistencies due to administration variations. This creates a need for contrast-agent-free alternatives.

Method: Proposed 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model that first encodes T1w and T2-FLAIR images into latent space using a pretrained autoencoder, then trains a rectified flow diffusion model in this latent space. Trained on BraTS 2024 datasets (glioma, meningioma, metastases) with 2860 training, 612 validation, and 614 test patients.

Result: T1C-RFlow outperformed benchmark models (pix2pix, DDPM, DiT-3D) with best tumor reconstruction performance. Achieved NMSE 0.044-0.098 and SSIM 0.905-0.937 across different tumor types. Significantly faster denoising (6.9s/volume) than conventional DDPM (37.7s) and patch-based methods (4.3hr/volume).

Conclusion: The method generates synthetic T1C images closely resembling ground truth in much less time than previous diffusion models, potentially enabling practical contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in unified video modeling including semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance, limitations of uniform cross-modal attention, and efficient extension of image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining.

Method: Couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through lightweight adapter, introduces Temperature Modality Alignment for prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection.

Conclusion: UniVid presents an effective unified architecture for video understanding and generation that addresses key challenges and demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical image segmentation by combining detail enhancement, low-rank adapters, and efficient attention mechanisms, achieving SOTA performance while updating only 1.8% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with medical image segmentation due to domain mismatch, and there's a need for efficient fine-tuning methods that maintain strong performance with minimal resource demands in clinical practice.

Method: Proposes three components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network with depthwise separable convolutions for boundary features, (2) low-rank adapters in Vision Transformer blocks for medical context optimization, (3) low-rank tensor attention mechanism in mask decoder for memory efficiency.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods including fully fine-tuned MedSAM on medical segmentation datasets while updating only 1.8% (11.7M) of parameters, with 75% memory reduction and improved inference speed.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM provides an effective and efficient solution for adapting foundation models to medical imaging, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter updates and significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D is a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction model that efficiently creates temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling novel view and time synthesis through streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D human reconstruction are either too slow or cannot generate novel-time representations, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Uses streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction with learnable state tokens for temporal consistency, and a motion prediction module with occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion for novel time synthesis. Employs self-supervised retargeting loss and optical flow loss for motion supervision.

Result: The model effectively reconstructs dynamic 3D humans from sparse-view videos and enables both novel view and novel time synthesis, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Forge4D provides an efficient solution for 4D human reconstruction and interpolation from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, addressing the limitations of existing methods in speed and novel-time representation capabilities.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ is a scalable audio-visual masked autoencoder framework that addresses data limitations in affective video facial analysis through dual masking, improved correlation learning, and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited data availability in affective video facial analysis and explore the impact of scaling on this domain while improving cross-modal correlation modeling.

Method: Proposes AVF-MAE++ with dual masking strategy across modalities, enhanced modality encoders, Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and progressive semantic injection strategy with three training stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets covering three major AVFA tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's importance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates scalable pre-training for AVFA, with each proposed component contributing to improved performance and better cross-modal correlation learning.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global

TL;DR: Two training-free inference techniques for robot video generation that actively use action parameters to guide diffusion models, improving motion control and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build better world models and robotics foundation models by generating realistic robot videos from action trajectories, addressing the need for effective motion control in video generation.

Method: Action-scaled classifier-free guidance that modulates guidance strength based on action magnitude, and action-scaled noise truncation that adjusts initial noise distribution to match motion dynamics.

Result: Significant improvements in action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments, demonstrated on real robot manipulation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free techniques effectively exploit explicit action parameters to enhance robot video generation quality and controllability.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR) enables autoregressive reasoning directly in visual embedding space, improving perception-intensive visual question answering by interleaving visual token reconstruction with text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs with CoT reasoning are limited to language space, treating visual information as static preconditions rather than enabling dynamic visual reasoning.

Method: Visual encoder projects images into visual tokens in joint semantic space; language model generates latent states to reconstruct key visual tokens for answering queries, combined with GRPO reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 71.67% on MMVP benchmark compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL, showing substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding and perception.

Conclusion: LVR paradigm enables effective visual reasoning in embedding space, significantly enhancing multimodal models' perception capabilities beyond language-only reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs are optimized for human visual fidelity but ill-suited for MLLMs, which require efficient compression for cloud deployment with minimal bandwidth usage from edge devices.

Method: Leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate importance maps for bit allocation, and integrates a lightweight decoder adapter with multi-level loss function to preserve both low-level details and high-level semantic context.

Result: Achieves up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining same performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTAM codec effectively addresses the unique compression needs of MLLMs by adaptively protecting multi-level features, demonstrating significant bandwidth efficiency gains.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Motivation: To address the substantial storage and computational demands of binary SNNs and further explore compression and acceleration potential for resource-limited deployment.

Method: Proposes Sub-bit SNNs (S²NNs) with outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization (OS-Quant) to mitigate codeword selection bias, and membrane potential-based feature distillation (MPFD) for improved performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show S²NNs outperform existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency across vision and non-vision tasks.

Conclusion: S²NNs are promising for edge computing applications due to their superior efficiency and performance compared to existing quantized SNN approaches.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Motivation: Ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images remains challenging in medical image synthesis using deep generative models, especially for direct or counterfactual generation tasks.

Method: Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM) incorporates cycle constraints to enforce consistency between generated and original images, using a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models.

quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) is proposed to address point cloud registration challenges caused by density distortions, noise, and geometric deformations. The method uses corruption-resilient skeletal representations and combines transformations from both point cloud and skeleton alignments to achieve robust and accurate registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds suffer from sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors that cause density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods relying on direct point matching or surface features are highly susceptible to these corruptions, leading to reduced alignment accuracy.

Method: The framework introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation and integrates skeletal structures into the registration process. It combines transformations from both corrupted point cloud alignment and skeleton alignment. A distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce consistency between source and target skeletons.

Result: Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets show that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.

Conclusion: SRRF demonstrates robustness in handling corrupted point clouds by considering both original local geometric features and global skeleton structure stability, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

### [230] [Robust Partial 3D Point Cloud Registration via Confidence Estimation under Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24275)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEGC is a confidence-driven framework for partial 3D point cloud registration that jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using global context to handle structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration faces challenges from structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, making accurate alignment difficult in complex scenes.

Method: Uses hybrid overlap confidence estimation combining semantic descriptors and geometric similarity, context-aware matching with global attention for soft confidence scores, and differentiable weighted SVD solver guided by confidence scores.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

### [231] [ASIA: Adaptive 3D Segmentation using Few Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24288)
*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA is a novel framework for 3D segmentation that uses few image annotations to segment both semantic and non-semantic parts in 3D objects, leveraging diffusion models to transfer 2D segmentations to 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation methods require expensive multi-view images, complex 3D annotations, or ambiguous text descriptions. ASIA addresses this by using easier-to-collect in-the-wild image annotations.

Method: Leverages text-to-image diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) to transfer segmentations from 2D to 3D. Optimizes text tokens for each segment, uses cross-view part correspondence loss during training, and employs Noise Optimization and UV-space voting for inference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, providing a practical solution for semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation.

Conclusion: ASIA offers a generalizable and practical approach for 3D segmentation using few image annotations, successfully handling both semantic and non-semantic parts even when annotated and target objects differ significantly.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Hanqi Chen,Zhongyin Zhao,Ye Chen,Zhujin Liang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVGThinker is a reasoning-driven framework for text-to-SVG generation that improves generalization and instruction adherence by aligning SVG code production with the visualization process using chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions in text-to-SVG generation, leveraging recent advances in large language models.

Method: A pipeline that renders each SVG primitive sequentially, uses multimodal models for image and code annotation, builds stepwise updates mirroring incremental primitive addition, and trains LLMs with supervised fine-tuning using chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs while preserving structural advantages of vector graphics, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise and hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation, unlike image-based methods.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker is a novel framework that enables Large Vision-Language Models to iteratively interrogate long videos through strategic frame selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to inefficient uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inadequate for visually intensive video tasks.

Method: A two-phase training strategy: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning to instill fundamental action capabilities, 2) Reinforcement Learning with comprehensive reward design to optimize strategic decision-making policy for frame selection.

Result: Achieves +10.4% average improvement over baselines while drastically reducing processed frames. The 7B model establishes SOTA on LongVideo-Reason with 76.1% accuracy using only 20.6 frames on average - outperforming LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) with 20x fewer frames.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness in long video reasoning, enabling LVLMs to think strategically about video content through iterative frame interrogation.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa is an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes explicit triangle meshes and 2D Gaussian splats for improved indoor reconstruction, addressing geometry inaccuracies in texture-less regions and decoupling issues in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods suffer from inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and the decoupling of mesh extraction from optimization, missing opportunities to leverage mesh geometry for guiding splat optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats using flexible binding strategy, integrating mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision, with heuristic iterative mesh-refinement strategy for splitting high-error faces and pruning unreliable ones.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-L1 by 47.3% over 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction through joint optimization and mesh refinement strategies.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model advances scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET by effectively addressing key challenges through synthetic data generation, equivariance enhancement, and noise resilience.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR addresses variance collapse in autoregressive image generation by constraining VAE latents to a fixed-radius hypersphere, achieving state-of-the-art performance for AR models on ImageNet generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which gets amplified during decoding and causes variance collapse, especially under classifier-free guidance.

Method: Proposes SphereAR which constrains all AR inputs and outputs to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere using hyperspherical VAEs, removing the scale component that causes variance collapse.

Result: SphereAR-H (943M) achieves FID 1.34 on ImageNet, setting new state-of-the-art for AR models. Smaller variants SphereAR-L (479M) and SphereAR-B (208M) achieve FID 1.54 and 1.92 respectively, outperforming larger baselines.

Conclusion: SphereAR is the first pure next-token AR image generator with raster order that surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperspherical constraints for stabilizing AR decoding.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-reflective multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering that handles multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence through collaborative roles for retrieval, reflection, answering, and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural VQA approaches are limited to text-only queries or single-image cases, failing to handle real-world scenarios with multi-image inputs across spatial scales and growth stages, and struggling with incomplete evidence due to limited external context access.

Method: A four-role multi-agent framework: Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information; Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers reformulation; two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel; Improver refines responses through iterative checks while aligning multi-image information.

Result: Experiments on AgMMU benchmark show competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Conclusion: The proposed self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing agricultural VQA systems by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, and iterative improvement for multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion is an implicit latent video diffusion model that generates videos by synthesizing neural network weights, which form an implicit neural representation (INR) to decode videos from frame indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and high-quality video synthesis by compressing and generating videos holistically as unified neural networks, avoiding temporal cross-frame attentions in denoisers.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hypernetwork-based tokenizer encodes videos to neural parameter space, 2) Implicit diffusion transformer denoises latent INR weights. Uses Gaussian-distributed weights with cross-layer latent reuse and modified NeRV architecture.

Result: Achieves superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 benchmarks.

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion provides an effective approach for video generation through implicit neural representations, enabling smooth interpolations and efficient synthesis without temporal cross-frame attentions.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance while achieving a balance between model performance and complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer effectively addresses computational efficiency and local detail extraction challenges in multi-organ medical image segmentation, providing superior performance with balanced model complexity.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [242] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT is a stochastic ensemble defense that disrupts gradient consensus to prevent adversarial transferability, achieving strong robustness on ImageNet with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses fail when gradients can be reliably estimated. The key vulnerability is gradient consensus - where randomized transformations yield aligned gradients that attackers exploit for transferable attacks.

Method: DRIFT uses a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. It enforces gradient dissonance by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions through consensus-divergence training combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness.

Result: DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks.

Conclusion: DRIFT establishes gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense, delivering robustness improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-UG is a unified MLLM that integrates UI understanding and generation capabilities, achieving SOTA performance on understanding tasks and competitive generation quality with much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific UI tasks, particularly in understanding accuracy and generation quality for complex modern UIs.

Method: Uses SFT with GRPO for understanding tasks, DPO for generation tasks, and proposes an industrial workflow including LLM-friendly DSL, training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieves SOTA on UI understanding tasks, outperforming larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. UI generation performance is on par with larger MLLMs at a fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: Integrating understanding and generation tasks improves accuracy and quality for both tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified approach.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

### [244] [Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365)
*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X is a novel multimodal architecture that addresses gradient conflicts in shared transformers by using modality-specific layers at both ends and shared middle layers, achieving superior efficiency and performance compared to standard unified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard unified multimodal models using shared autoregressive transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text modalities due to their fundamentally different low-level statistical properties, particularly in shallow and deep layers.

Method: Proposed Uni-X architecture with X-shaped design: dedicated modality-specific initial and final layers for processing, while maintaining shared parameters in middle layers for high-level semantic fusion to eliminate gradient conflicts.

Result: Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency and, when scaled to 3B parameters, matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs with GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong performance in text/vision understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X establishes a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling by effectively resolving gradient conflicts through its specialized architecture design.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

### [245] [Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24367)
*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes R²M, a training-free model merging framework for deepfake detection that combines specialist models by decomposing them into shared Real components and Fake residuals, enabling composable detection without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. Model merging is well-suited for deepfake detection since specialists share the same binary decision task and differ only in generator-specific artifacts.

Method: R²M uses low-rank factorization to estimate shared Real components from task vectors, decomposes specialists into Real-aligned parts and Fake residuals, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent dominance by any single generator.

Result: R²M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset scenarios. It maintains performance while being composable - new forgery families can be handled by fine-tuning one specialist and re-merging.

Conclusion: Model merging is an effective approach for deepfake detection that avoids the need for exhaustive retraining. R²M provides a training-free framework that preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues, enabling scalable and composable detection of evolving deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

*Khawlah Bajbaa,Abbas Anwar,Muhammad Saqib,Hafeez Anwar,Nabin Sharma,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining diffusion models and conditional GANs to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, achieving improved visual quality and geometric consistency compared to diffusion-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street view imagery is valuable for urban analytics, but synthesizing street-view images from satellite imagery is challenging due to significant appearance and perspective differences between the two domains.

Method: Multi-stage training strategy using Stable Diffusion as core component in dual-branch architecture, integrated with conditional GAN for panoramic street views, and fusion strategy to leverage both models' strengths.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics on CVUSA dataset, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GAN methods, generates realistic street-view images preserving fine details like street markings and clouds.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully generates geographically consistent street-view images with improved visual quality and geometric consistency by combining diffusion models and conditional GANs.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

*Congjia Chen,Yufu Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOReg is a point cloud registration network that effectively fuses visual features from DINOv2 with geometric features at patch level, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods rely mainly on geometric information and don't fully exploit rich texture and semantic information from images. Current multi-modal approaches use image-lossy feature fusion that limits performance.

Method: Uses DINOv2 to extract visual features from images and fuses them with geometric features at patch level. Proposes mixed positional embedding to encode both image and point cloud spatial information. Combines texture/semantic information from DINOv2 with geometric structure from geometric backbone.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets: 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall.

Conclusion: DINOReg effectively leverages both visual and geometric information through patch-level fusion and mixed positional embedding, demonstrating superior performance in point cloud registration tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAE is a mask clustering-based annotation engine that enables efficient large-scale land cover mapping of submeter imagery by treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units, improving annotation efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submeter resolution imagery offers fine-grained detail but lacks sufficient high-quality annotated datasets for large-scale land cover mapping, as existing annotation methods are unreliable or prohibitively expensive.

Method: Proposed Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE) that leverages spatial autocorrelation principle, treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units to enable simultaneous annotation of multiple instances.

Result: Built HiCity-LC dataset with ~14 billion labeled pixels, achieving above 85% classification accuracy across five major Chinese cities. This is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalability and practical utility for large-scale submeter resolution mapping, significantly improving annotation efficiency while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN is a self-supervised framework for procedure learning that uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to handle non-monotonic step orders, irrelevant frames, and repeated actions in instructional videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world procedural videos contain background segments, repeated actions, and out-of-order steps that violate monotonicity assumptions in existing alignment methods. Prior approaches like OPEL rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture higher-order temporal structure.

Method: Uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under partial alignment. Integrates FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning for training stability.

Result: Achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks. Produces more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: REALIGN effectively handles the variability in real-world instructional videos by modeling both visual and temporal relationships, outperforming previous methods and providing better interpretability.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model that processes video inputs without external 3D data, using geometric priors and a Cross-Task Adapter to achieve superior 3D scene understanding across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal reasoning from 2D to 3D domains is challenging, and existing 3D-MLLMs rely on 3D data inputs which limit scalability and real-world deployment.

Method: Uses video inputs without external 3D data, integrates geometric priors via Cross-Task Adapter, employs Metric Depth Model for geometric consistency, and fine-tunes with two-stage distillation optimization.

Result: Achieves superior performance on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding tasks across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating strong multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM provides a practical and scalable solution for 3D scene understanding by leveraging video inputs and geometric priors without requiring external 3D data.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF is a framework that uses space-filling curves to systematically identify and classify vulnerable road user situations for robotaxi operational design domain analysis, extending the SMIRK dataset to handle multi-pedestrian scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotaxis need reliable VRU detection in urban areas, and end-to-end AI systems require high-quality data for training and evaluation within their operational design domains.

Method: Extended SMIRK dataset to MoreSMIRK with multi-pedestrian crossing situations, used space-filling curves to transform scenario features into patterns for matching with dictionary entries.

Result: Successfully identified and classified complex pedestrian crossings in the PIE dataset (150+ annotated videos), handling group merging/splitting scenarios.

Conclusion: PCICF effectively supports ODD incident analysis and has potential for onboard robotaxi use due to computational efficiency.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Method: Proposes a novel spatio-angular latent space encoding spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations, with multi-step training process decomposition.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables rapid generation of consistent multi-view images, advancing text-to-3D asset creation.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ is a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for diffusion transformers that achieves 4-bit quantization with minimal performance degradation, providing 4x memory saving and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers face practical deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model sizes, and existing post-training quantization methods cause significant performance degradation.

Method: Three key designs: cross-block calibration for accurate data distribution, orthogonal-based smoothing to handle outliers, and cross-layer parameter searching for optimal quantization.

Result: Successfully compresses models to W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.

Conclusion: CLQ enables efficient deployment of diffusion transformers on edge devices through effective quantization while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

TL;DR: This paper develops a systematic pipeline for assessing image dataset quality using CleanVision and Fastdup tools with automatic thresholding, showing significant improvements in detecting low-quality images and near-duplicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model architectures mature with diminishing returns from refinements, data quality has become critical, but systematic studies on evaluating image dataset quality remain limited.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup tools with enhancements including automatic threshold selection, and analyzed impact of various image quality issues on model performance using CIFAKE dataset.

Result: Automatic thresholding improved F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 (single perturbations) and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 (dual perturbations). Near-duplicate detection F1 score increased from 0.4576 to 0.7928.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively advances data quality assessment in image-based ML, showing CNNs are resilient to some distortions but vulnerable to blurring and severe downscaling that obscure critical features.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS introduces occlusion awareness to 3D Gaussian Splatting using a fast proxy system that produces occlusion depth maps in under 1ms, enabling both rendering acceleration and quality improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from significant redundancy due to lack of occlusion awareness, leading to computational inefficiency and rendering inconsistencies in occluded regions.

Method: Uses a fast proxy system to generate precise occlusion depth maps at 1000x1000 resolution in under 1ms, which guides Gaussian culling for rendering acceleration and densification during training to avoid occluded region inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS while delivering substantially higher rendering quality, particularly effective in heavily occluded scenarios like MatrixCity Streets dataset.

Conclusion: Proxy-GS successfully addresses occlusion redundancy in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling both faster rendering and improved visual quality by introducing occlusion awareness through an efficient proxy system.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that uses decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment without ground-truth flow supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches implicitly learn flow estimation from appearance similarity alone, which doesn't adequately address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment in cross-modal scenarios.

Method: Uses a decoupled optimization strategy with collaborative training of modality transfer and flow estimation networks, geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline with outlier-robust loss, and cross-modal consistency constraint for joint optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and can be integrated with various flow estimation networks, as demonstrated on a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark.

Conclusion: DCFlow effectively addresses cross-modal flow estimation challenges through its novel framework design and optimization strategies, outperforming previous unsupervised methods.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Image-to-Video (I2V) models with focus on semantic understanding and reasoning, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V evaluation benchmarks overlook semantic understanding of specific subjects in input images and alignment with physical laws and human commonsense.

Method: Proposes UI2V-Bench with four evaluation dimensions (spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, reasoning) using MLLM-based evaluation pipelines and 500 text-image pairs.

Result: Evaluated various open-source and closed-source I2V models, with human evaluations showing strong alignment with MLLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench fills critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning, providing robust framework for future research.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

*Yanpeng Zhao,Shanyan Guan,Yunbo Wang,Yanhao Ge,Wei Li,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a deep learning framework that generates interactive 3D virtual worlds from single images using hybrid 3D/2D representations, enabling progressive detail enhancement during user exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by on-demand worldbuilding from Simulacron-3, to create efficient virtual worlds where only actively explored regions render with high visual realism, overcoming limitations of global world generation and 2D hallucination methods.

Method: Uses hybrid scene structure with object-centric 3D representations for foreground objects and 2D synthesis for backgrounds/non-interacted regions. Combines representation learning and object-to-3D techniques for flexible viewpoint manipulation and natural language control of object appearance/dynamics.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark. Enables progressive unfolding of virtual worlds with increasing 3D detail during user interaction.

Conclusion: NeoWorld delivers dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experiences through its efficient hybrid 3D/2D approach that progressively enhances detail based on user interaction.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

### [259] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to enhance VideoQA by synthesizing richer supervisory signals through Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), moving beyond isolated factual QA pairs to capture narrative structure and visual rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models are limited by 'bag-of-facts' supervision that fails to capture narrative and causal event structure, leading to shallow video understanding.

Method: Two strategies: QBP synthesizes diverse questions into holistic narrative paragraphs reconstructing video event structure; QBC generates fine-grained visual rationales grounding answers in specific evidence. Both use generative models to create synthetic data for unified next-token prediction training.

Result: Significant accuracy gains on STAR (72.5% for 3B model, +4.9%) and NExT-QA (80.8% for 7B model), establishing new SOTA. Both QBP and QBC enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP accelerating convergence by over 2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA training.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-model ensemble approach using knowledge distillation for general anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across both industrial inspection and semantic anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are biased towards industrial inspection and struggle with generalization across different domains like semantic anomaly detection. Existing general AD methods are sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks.

Method: Proposed a dual-model ensemble framework with teacher and two student models: Encoder-Decoder model for industrial AD (patch-level defects) and Encoder-Encoder model for semantic AD. Both use shared DINOv2 encoder, trained with Noisy-OR objective, with final anomaly score from joint probability of local and semantic scores.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmarks: 99.7% AUROC on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, outperforming prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates strong generalization across multiple anomaly detection domains, effectively bridging the gap between industrial and semantic anomaly detection while maintaining high performance in both single-class and multi-class settings.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot optimization method that integrates Laban movement analysis into text-to-motion diffusion models to achieve fine-grained expressive control of human motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion synthesis lacks fine-grained expressive control due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and difficulty expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language.

Method: A zero-shot inference-time optimization method that updates text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during sampling to guide motion generation toward desired Laban Effort and Shape components without additional training data.

Result: The approach successfully generates diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Conclusion: Integrating Laban movement analysis quantification methods enables interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation in text-guided models.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task to enhance spatial intelligence in MLLMs, creating a 30K dataset (Euclid30K) and achieving significant zero-shot improvements across spatial reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), including abilities like visualizing shapes, mental rotation, and relational reasoning.

Method: Created Euclid30K dataset with 30K geometry problems, used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 models on Euclidean principles for shape identification, counting, and deductive reasoning.

Result: Models achieved substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks, with VSI-Bench accuracy improving from 34.5% to 40.5% overall, and RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B reaching 49.6% accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

TL;DR: A selective representation framework for second-hand fashion image retrieval that shrinks databases to 10% of original size while maintaining accuracy through clustering, coreset selection, and outlier removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fashion industry contributes significantly to waste and emissions, creating need for scalable second-hand marketplaces where machine learning can enable large-scale valuation of used garments.

Method: Uses clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples, plus an outlier removal method based on neighbour-homogeneity consistency score to filter uncharacteristic samples before selection.

Result: Achieves 10x database size reduction without sacrificing retrieval accuracy on DeepFashion datasets, with outlier removal further improving performance by removing non-discriminative samples.

Conclusion: Strategic pruning and selection of representative image vectors enables efficient second-hand fashion retrieval with near-optimal accuracy and significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

TL;DR: SCPO is a novel framework that addresses visual hallucinations in MLLMs through semantic curriculum preference optimization, reducing hallucination rates by up to 62.9% while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations where responses contradict visual evidence, and existing DPO methods fail to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourage shortcut learning.

Method: Proposes Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO) with progressive easy-to-hard curriculum using Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, dynamic reference model, and symmetric bidirectional objective for simultaneous text and visual preference learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCPO reduces hallucination rate by up to 62.9% on LLaVA models across various scales, improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, and maintains stable performance on vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

TL;DR: EQUISeg is a multimodal segmentation framework that addresses modality imbalance through equal encoding, cross-modal transformer blocks, and a self-guided module for mutual guidance between modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies where performance degrades significantly when a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes EQUISeg with four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus a Self-guided Module with mutual guidance mechanism to adaptively adjust modality contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates adverse effects of modality imbalance.

Conclusion: EQUISeg successfully addresses the critical challenge of modality balance in practical multimodal segmentation through equal encoding and mutual guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP text encoders often fail in complex scenes with many objects during instruction-driven image editing, particularly in maintaining object counts and spatial layouts across diverse categories.

Method: QL-Adapter uses ILFM to fuse layout priors with CLIP image encoder's ViT patch tokens for spatial structure understanding, and CMAM to inject image features into text branch to enrich textual embeddings. Also built QL-Dataset benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show QL-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit) and significantly outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: QL-Adapter effectively addresses multiple object editing challenges by combining layout fusion and cross-modal augmentation, demonstrating superior performance on complex scene editing tasks.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) introduces a lightweight intermediate training stage between diffusion pre-training and flow map training that stabilizes training, reduces computational costs, and achieves state-of-the-art few-step generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow map models like Consistency Models and Mean Flow suffer from unstable training, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high computational costs, even when initialized from pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: CMT trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model directly to the solver-generated clean sample, creating a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization for subsequent flow map training.

Result: CMT achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time compared to Consistency Models.

Conclusion: CMT provides a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models, enabling fast and robust convergence without heuristics while significantly reducing training time and computational requirements.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved method for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping using SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement for better mask generation and context-aware CLIP encoding for richer semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to direct use of raw masks from vision-language models, limiting effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: Leverages SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate object-level masks, and employs context-aware CLIP encoding with multiple contextual views and empirical weighting for richer semantic context.

Result: Experimental evaluation on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks shows significant improvements over existing methods in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by improving mask generation and semantic context, demonstrating superior performance in 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first unified theoretical and experimental comparison between Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, showing that Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion about which approach (Diffusion Bridge vs Flow Matching) is generally preferable, and substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions have hindered unified theoretical comparison of their relative merits.

Method: Recast both frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport perspectives, propose a novel Diffusion Bridge architecture with latent Transformer, implement Flow Matching with same structure for fair comparison, and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple tasks with varying distributional discrepancies and training data sizes.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function guiding toward more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching interpolation coefficients become ineffective with reduced training data. Experimental results across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks perfectly align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study systematically delineates the respective advantages and disadvantages of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, providing clear guidance on when each approach is preferable based on theoretical insights and extensive empirical validation.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

*Yuhao Wang,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A crowd counting method for foggy environments using atmospheric scattering physics and neural networks to improve accuracy in dense fog scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in crowd counting in foggy environments: long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation.

Method: 1) Differentiable atmospheric scattering model with transmittance dynamic estimation and scattering parameter calibration; 2) MSA-KAN network based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem for enhanced nonlinear representation; 3) Weather-aware GCN with dynamic spatial adjacency matrices.

Result: Achieves 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios on four public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions through synergistic optimization of physical mechanisms and data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed
to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context
recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for
our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that
facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we
present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task.
Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated
question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging
from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably
and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to
be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art

### [272] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap is a stealthy backdoor attack on LVLMs that disrupts object relationship understanding rather than using fixed target patterns, making it harder to detect than traditional attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs use fixed target patterns that are easily detectable due to model overconfidence on frequent patterns. TokenSwap aims to create more evasive attacks by targeting compositional understanding.

Method: TokenSwap injects visual triggers into training samples and swaps grammatical roles of key tokens in textual answers. It uses an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize learning of swapped tokens, associating visual triggers with bags-of-words behavior.

Result: TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates that backdoor attacks targeting compositional understanding are more evasive than fixed-pattern attacks, highlighting new security vulnerabilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

### [273] [SCOPE: Semantic Conditioning for Sim2Real Category-Level Object Pose Estimation in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24572)
*Peter Hönig,Stefan Thalhammer,Jean-Baptiste Weibel,Matthias Hirschmanner,Markus Vincze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that uses DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors to eliminate the need for discrete category labels, enabling generalization to both known categories and beyond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in open environments encounter unknown objects that require semantic understanding for manipulation. Current methods need discrete category labels, limiting generalization to unseen object categories.

Method: Combines DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals. Uses cross-attention to inject semantic priors and learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across instances.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation with 31.9% relative improvement on 5°5cm metric. Achieves up to 100% success rate in grasping unseen objects from unknown categories.

Conclusion: SCOPE enables effective generalization beyond known object categories by leveraging continuous semantic priors, bridging the Sim2Real gap and facilitating manipulation of previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

*Zidu Wang,Meng Xu,Miao Xu,Hengyuan Ma,Jiankuo Zhao,Xutao Li,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint face-skull morphable model (BFSM) is developed for medical applications using a novel registration method and bidirectional shape inference between face and skull with tissue thickness modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of paired face-skull data, registration accuracy issues, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical applications, while also including individuals with craniofacial deformities who are often overlooked.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 200+ samples with CT-based skulls, CT-based faces, and textured face scans. Proposed dense ray matching registration for topological consistency. Developed 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) with shared coefficient space and tissue thickness variation modeling.

Result: The method enables robust and accurate bidirectional shape inference between face and skull, supporting one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull to reflect individual changes like fat over time.

Conclusion: BFSM demonstrates strong potential for medical applications including 3D face-skull reconstruction from single images and surgical planning prediction, with extensive experiments confirming its robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of YOLOv11 variants for automated peripheral blood smear detection using a large annotated dataset, showing YOLOv11 Medium achieves best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is labor intensive and subjective, while existing deep learning solutions lack systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models like YOLOv11 for fine-grained blood cell detection.

Method: Curated large-scale dataset with 16,891 images and 298,850 annotated cells across 12 peripheral blood cell classes plus red blood cells. Evaluated five YOLOv11 variants (Nano to XLarge) under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) using multiple performance metrics including mAP, precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency.

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieved best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under 80:10:10 split. Larger models provided only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. The 80:10:10 split consistently outperformed 70:20:10 across all models.

Conclusion: YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, is highly effective for automated fine-grained peripheral blood smear detection. The publicly released dataset provides valuable resource for advancing blood cell detection research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Jyotirmoy Amin,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel unsupervised framework using structured optimal transport with ASTGCN for automatic motion phase segmentation in elite javelin-throw, achieving 71.02% mAP and 74.61% F1-score without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports analytics methods are manual, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of kinetic variables requires robust temporal segmentation, especially in biomechanically complex sports like javelin-throw.

Method: Unsupervised framework combining structured optimal transport (SOT) with Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) for contextually aware motion phase segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods with 71.02% mean average precision and 74.61% F1-score on test data. Also releases new dataset of 211 annotated professional javelin-throw videos.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively identifies motion phase transitions in javelin-throw without expensive manual labeling, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet is a plug-and-play framework that turns any multimodal large language model (MLLM) into a two-stage retriever without additional training, using semantic embeddings for candidate search and reasoning for reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are emerging as versatile foundations for mixed-modality retrieval but typically require heavy post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders. This work explores whether off-the-shelf MLLMs can serve as powerful retrievers without additional training.

Method: FreeRet uses a two-stage approach: first derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, then exploits the model's reasoning ability for precise reranking. Key innovations include bypassing lexical alignment layers, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.

Result: On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. The framework is model-agnostic, scales across MLLM families and sizes, preserves generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated benchmark from COIN dataset for evaluating event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions. It tests VLMs and humans on rearranging event clips into coherent sequences, revealing significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for probing visual reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions and assess the gap between human reasoning and state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Method: Created SPLICE benchmark with 3,381 human-filtered videos from 12 categories, segmented into 11,423 event clips. Evaluated both human participants and VLMs on rearranging clips into coherent sequences, with and without human-annotated textual descriptions.

Result: Significant performance gap between humans and VLMs. Human-annotated descriptions improve model accuracy but don't affect human performance. VLMs perform better on temporal/causal reasoning tasks than contextual/spatial reasoning, and better on everyday tasks than specialized ones.

Conclusion: VLMs still fall short of human-level reasoning, relying more on language priors than visual understanding. Persistent challenges remain in visual reasoning, particularly for contextual and spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIFLE is a diffusion-based framework that removes flicker-banding artifacts from photos of emissive displays while preserving fine details, using a flicker-banding prior estimator and masked loss for targeted restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding artifacts frequently degrade photos of screens due to temporal aliasing between camera rolling-shutter and display modulation, but this problem has been underexplored compared to moire degradation.

Method: Proposes RIFLE framework with flicker-banding prior estimator to predict banding attributes, masked loss to focus on banded regions, and a simulation pipeline to generate training data with realistic FB artifacts.

Result: RIFLE outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real-world dataset, handling mild to severe flicker-banding effectively.

Conclusion: This is the first work to systematically address flicker-banding simulation and removal, establishing foundations for future research with released dataset and code.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

*Adil Kaan Akan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotAdapt, a framework that adapts pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis in images and videos, enabling fine-grained control over individual objects while maintaining scene coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. The goal is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects for controllable generation.

Method: Integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained diffusion models. For images: uses register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects. For videos: uses Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and Transformer-based temporal aggregator.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. Establishes new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, supporting advanced editing tasks like object removal, replacement, and insertion.

Conclusion: Provides a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling that bridges human object-based perception with machine learning, expanding possibilities for interactive and structured generative tools.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Conclusion: The hybrid Volterra-ODE approach provides an effective framework for image classification that balances performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven
state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while
requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and
Imagenet1K.

*Hanyu Zhang,Yiming Zhou,Jinxia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A classifier-centric adaptive framework improves open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by enhancing classification via a lightweight text adapter with layered asymmetric initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires high generalization for unseen categories, and existing methods suffer from classification component limitations affecting overall segmentation performance.

Method: Proposes a classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter using layered asymmetric initialization to improve classification capabilities.

Result: Substantial improvements over OVCoser baseline on OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increased from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, cMAE reduced from 0.336 to 0.239.

Conclusion: Targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance in open-vocabulary settings.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing

TL;DR: Automated segmentation pipeline for traumatic brain injury lesions using nnUNet framework with post-processing, achieving competitive performance in AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBI lesions are highly heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, complicating neuroimaging analysis tasks like registration and parcellation, requiring accurate segmentation methods.

Method: Leveraged nnUNet framework with various architectures for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.8451, Dice scores of 0.4711 (images with lesions) and 0.8514 (images without lesions), overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking top-6 in AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Developed effective automated segmentation pipeline for TBI lesions with competitive performance, publicly available Python implementation.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video is an efficient small diffusion model that generates high-resolution, minute-long videos with fast inference speed and low training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, high-quality video generation with long duration and high resolution while reducing computational costs and deployment requirements.

Method: Uses Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency and constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable long video generation with global context at fixed memory cost.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while being 16x faster in latency, deployable on RTX 5090 GPUs with 2.4x speedup for 5-second 720p video generation.

Conclusion: SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation through efficient architecture design and training strategies.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves physical plausibility in video generation by using physics-aware reasoning to create counterfactual prompts and a novel guidance strategy to suppress implausible content during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for video generation implicitly learn physics from large datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still produces physically implausible motions that violate fundamental laws.

Method: Uses a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to create counterfactual prompts encoding physics-violating behaviors, and proposes Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) with synchronized directional normalization and trajectory-decoupled denoising to suppress implausible content.

Result: Experiments across different physical domains show substantial enhancement in physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, with no additional training required. Both components (physics-aware reasoning and SDG) are validated as critical to the improvements.

Conclusion: Establishes a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that explicitly reasons about physical plausibility at inference time without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

TL;DR: IWR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LVLMs on interactive webpage reconstruction from video, addressing limitations of static screenshot-to-code tasks by focusing on dynamic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, overlooking dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications.

Method: Introduces IWR-Bench with 113 tasks from 100 real websites, featuring user interaction videos and static assets, evaluated using agent-as-a-judge framework with functional correctness and visual fidelity metrics.

Result: Best model achieves only 36.35% overall score, with functional correctness (24.39%) lagging significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25%), revealing limitations in temporal reasoning and event-driven logic synthesis.

Conclusion: IWR-Bench establishes a challenging frontier for vision-language research, highlighting critical gaps in current models' ability to handle dynamic web interactions.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging helps segment floating debris on water by mitigating surface glare, improving segmentation accuracy but increasing computational load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of floating debris is compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination, which polarimetric imaging can address.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO dataset of polarimetric images, comparing with single-image baselines using traditional models.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, improving mean IoU and lowering contour error compared to RGB inputs.

Conclusion: Polarized cameras provide sharper masks but increase computational load and risk of new false positives; benchmark helps researchers decide if suitable for their applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with 1.5M+ CT-PET images and clinical reports to address gaps in medical VLMs, particularly for PET/CT imaging and low-resource languages, and demonstrates improved VLM performance through comprehensive benchmarking.


<details>

Motivation: Address limitations in medical VLMs due to limited availability of diverse imaging modalities (especially PET/CT) and multilingual clinical data, with underrepresentation of low-resource languages like Vietnamese.

Method: Created a Vietnamese multimodal medical dataset with 1,567,062 CT-PET image pairs and 2,757 clinical reports, plus a training framework with data augmentation and expert-validated test sets for benchmarking VLMs on medical report generation and visual question answering.

Result: Experimental results show that incorporating the dataset significantly improves performance of existing VLMs on downstream tasks, demonstrating enhanced capability for medical imaging applications.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark serve as a pivotal step for advancing robust VLMs in medical imaging, particularly for low-resource languages, and improving clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Motivation: Existing multi-modal tracking approaches focus on dual-modal paradigms (RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal) and struggle in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. The authors aim to enhance robustness by leveraging three complementary modalities.

Method: Proposed RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning. It fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under an orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the foundation tracking model.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-modal tracking approach with RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities effectively enhances tracking performance and robustness in complex scenarios compared to dual-modal methods.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS is a feed-forward framework for extreme 3D Gaussian Splatting compression that combines Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for aggressive pruning and GaussPainter with diffusion priors for quality restoration, achieving over 100× compression while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations like 3DGS have high storage and transmission costs that hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either require costly optimization or degrade quality under high compression ratios.

Method: The framework uses UGC for re-optimization-free pruning to reduce Gaussian primitives, and GaussPainter which leverages diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned scenes. It uses a lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion for real-time restoration.

Result: Achieves over 100× compression (reducing 354.77 MB to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering, enabling practical deployment of compressed 3DGS models.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

Motivation: Multimodal large language models struggle to ground reasoning in perceptual evidence, requiring better perception strategies for improved performance.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses perception-augmented fine-tuning, Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

Result: Significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks, with explicit perception paired with textual cues showing best improvements.

Conclusion: VTPerception-R1 offers a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning, particularly effective for smaller models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning

especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,

Result: Achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 dataset in UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: SkyLink effectively addresses viewpoint disparity challenges in cross-view geo-localization through enhanced data processing, multi-scale feature aggregation, and 3D scene integration with contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 addresses long video understanding challenges by introducing adaptive zoom-in capability, allowing the model to dynamically adjust frame resolution based on spatial detail needs through multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs with uniform frame sampling struggle to balance temporal understanding and spatial perception, sacrificing either temporal clues or spatial details.

Method: Proposes adaptive zoom-in mechanism with multi-step reasoning, using densely sampled small-resolution frames initially and zooming in on clips when spatial details are needed. Trained with 38k CoT data and decoupled reinforcement finetuning.

Result: Achieves better trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, outperforming Qwen2.5-VL baseline by average 3.1% across 4 long video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism effectively resolves the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception in video analysis.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study identifies Vision Function Layers (VFLs) in MLLMs where specific visual functions like counting, grounding, and OCR are localized to 2-3 layers, following a consistent pattern across models that aligns with human visual processing hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual functions are distributed across decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models and leverage this understanding for more efficient model training and data selection.

Method: Developed Visual Token Swapping framework to analyze layer-specific functions by modifying KV cache entries, and applied selective LoRA training to VFLs and VFL-select for automated data classification.

Result: Found consistent VFL patterns across MLLMs aligned with human visual processing (recognition→counting→grounding). VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA and prevents function forgetting. VFL-select achieves 98% performance with only 20% data, surpassing human experts.

Conclusion: The study provides deeper understanding of MLLM visual processing, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models through targeted layer interventions and automated data selection.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

*Lei Tong,Zhihua Liu,Chaochao Lu,Dino Oglic,Tom Diethe,Philip Teare,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Chen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion models for counterfactual image generation, enabling causal interventions on attributes while preserving image identity through structural causal modeling and attribute regularization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise counterfactual image generation by performing causal interventions on target attributes and propagating their effects to causal dependents, addressing limitations of prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure.

Method: Leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection for semantic control and conditioned token contrastive loss for disentangling attribute factors and reducing spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum dataset for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation, demonstrating effectiveness across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

*Anirban Ghosh,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO-Net is a novel 3D object classification method that combines topological data analysis with image filtration techniques to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on point cloud data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification is crucial for applications like computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, but remains challenging due to unordered, irregular, and noisy point clouds.

Method: Transform point clouds into voxelized binary 3D images, extract topological features using topological data analysis and image filtration, then train a lightweight 1D CNN on these features.

Result: Achieved 99.05% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10 benchmarks, with strong performance on real-world OmniObject3D dataset and resilience to corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net sets new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object classification and demonstrates robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is the first tuning-free method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from unconstrained 2D photos, handling varying poses, viewpoints, cropping, and occlusions without requiring clean inputs or cross-view captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D reconstruction methods require clean inputs like full-body images with minimal occlusions or well-calibrated cross-view captures, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured in unconstrained settings.

Method: Introduces a data rectifier paradigm that converts unconstrained inputs into clean orthogonal multi-view images in seconds, a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA) for selective information fusion, and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor that eliminates need for pre-captured body templates.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress), with efficiency of 1.5 minutes per person and support for arbitrary pose control and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on.

Conclusion: UP2You provides a practical solution for real-world 3D portrait reconstruction from casual photos, demonstrating superior performance, efficiency, and versatility compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

### [298] [Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837)
*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenPruner is a training-free framework that prunes redundant visual tokens in Vision-Language Models by selecting tokens with high sensitivity and complementary information, achieving up to 94.4% token reduction and 2.30x faster inference while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods have limitations: attention-based approaches use unstable attention scores leading to redundant selections, while diversity-based methods risk dropping important regions needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, measuring how small random perturbations affect projection outputs to approximate each token's influence through lightweight forward passes without backpropagation.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenPruner consistently outperforms prior methods, pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference over baseline.

Conclusion: TokenPruner effectively addresses limitations of existing token pruning approaches by combining sensitivity estimation with complementary token selection, providing significant efficiency improvements for Vision-Language Models without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: PHASE-Net is a physics-informed rPPG model derived from hemodynamics equations, using a lightweight architecture with axial swapping, adaptive spatial filtering, and gated temporal convolutions for robust non-contact heart rate monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) lack theoretical grounding, limiting robustness and interpretability, especially under head motion and illumination changes.

Method: Derived from Navier-Stokes equations, the method shows pulse signals follow second-order dynamics leading to causal convolution. PHASE-Net uses Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper, Adaptive Spatial Filter, and Gated TCN for efficient feature mixing and temporal modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, outperforming existing methods in rPPG measurement accuracy.

Conclusion: PHASE-Net provides a theoretically grounded, deployment-ready rPPG solution that combines physics principles with efficient deep learning architecture for robust physiological monitoring.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Motivation: Current MDD diagnosis relies on subjective scales, while existing EEG deep learning models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore neuroscience prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ELPG-DTFS with: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), surpassing state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics with complementary module contributions.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static

and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and

Motivation: Inspired by human visual system's contrast enhancement and color-opponency mechanisms to improve robustness in adverse conditions.

Method: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels as model-agnostic preprocessing step.

Result: Maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions (night, fog, snow) on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing enables imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for safety-critical vision applications.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: StreamForest is a novel MLLM architecture for streaming video understanding that uses Persistent Event Memory Forest for efficient long-term memory and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for real-time perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited in real-time streaming scenarios due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes StreamForest with Persistent Event Memory Forest that organizes video frames into event-level tree structures using penalty functions, and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for detailed short-term visual cues. Also introduces OnlineIT instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: Achieves 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Maintains 96.8% average accuracy even under extreme visual token compression (1024 tokens).

Conclusion: StreamForest demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability for streaming video understanding, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

*Nikos Kostagiolas,Pantelis Georgiades,Yannis Panagakis,Mihalis A. Nicolaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model for satellite image generation that conditions on environmental context using three control signals: text, metadata, and visual data, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for remote sensing have limitations including reliance on limited environmental context, struggles with missing/corrupted data, and failure to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model conditioned on environmental context using three control signals (text, metadata, visual data), incorporating metadata fusion strategy to handle partially corrupt/missing observations, and modeling attribute embedding interactions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, quality measured using 6 metrics) in single-image and temporal generation trials.

Conclusion: Conditioning on environmental context improves foundation model performance for satellite imagery, making the model promising for downstream tasks. Also created the first publicly-available dataset combining data from three different mediums.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs hinders progress in multi-modal fusion tasks, making RGB-to-thermal translation essential for leveraging abundant RGB datasets.

Method: Proposes ThermalGen with RGB image conditioning architecture and style-disentangled mechanism, trained on eight public datasets plus three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets captured across diverse conditions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior performance to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods across multiple RGB-T benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first RGB-T translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: Vehicle type recognition faces class imbalance issues. The study combines multiple datasets, applies rebalancing techniques, and benchmarks ensemble methods against a CNN, finding CNN superior but highlighting persistent challenges with rare classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare vehicle categories, limiting the effectiveness of intelligent transportation and logistics systems.

Method: Curated a 16-class dataset (~47k images) from multiple sources, created balanced variants using SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling, and benchmarked lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting) against a configurable ResNet-style CNN with strong augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: Best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) achieved 74.8% test accuracy, while CNN achieved 79.19% on full test set and 81.25% on unseen inference batch. The most under-represented class (Barge) remained problematic despite rebalancing efforts.

Conclusion: Deep models have advantage over ensembles, but rebalancing alone is insufficient for rare classes. Future work should prioritize additional minority-class data collection, cost-sensitive objectives like focal loss, and hybrid ensemble-CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

TL;DR: MMRQA is a novel MRI quality assessment framework that combines multimodal large language models with acquisition-aware signal processing to bridge quantitative metrics with semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI quality assessment faces trade-offs: signal-based methods lack semantic understanding while deep learning approaches sacrifice interpretability. The need for clinically interpretable quality assessment that works across different protocols and can generalize well.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Robust metric extraction using MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, 2) Structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, 3) Parameter-efficient fusion through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization, validated by comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, generating clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with

*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN introduces a stealthy poisoning attack on generative models that uses optimized perturbations to cause targeted changes in generated images while maintaining or even improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore adversarial attacks on generative pipelines where small perturbations can cause controlled output changes, which is less studied compared to attacks on discriminative models.

Method: Combines a modular perturbation network (PoisonerNet) with a Generator-Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers, with evaluation using custom proxy metrics and perceptual/frequency domain analysis. Also tests transferability to diffusion models via ControlNet.

Result: Poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality than clean counterparts, and latent space poisoning can retain/enhance aesthetics while producing consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs.

Conclusion: The method exposes a blind spot in pixel-level defenses and raises concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines, as carefully optimized perturbations can be visually inconspicuous yet effective.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view synthesis by integrating structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion to address overfitting and geometric distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel View Synthesis from sparse views suffers from overfitting, geometric distortion, and incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. 3D Gaussian Splatting has floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under sparse-input settings.

Method: Proposes three components: 1) Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation with dense matching priors and multi-view constraints, 2) Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for stronger geometric constraints, 3) Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction using depth-difference mask and learning-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks with up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

Conclusion: DWGS effectively addresses sparse-view synthesis challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting through integrated structural enhancement, virtual view constraints, and occlusion completion.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

*Xi Chen,Hongxun Yao,Zhaopan Xu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM is a novel SFADA framework that integrates multimodal supervision from Vision-and-Language models with sparse human annotations through bidirectional distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent domain adaptation studies use ViL models but treat them as separate from data supervision, lacking effective fusion between multimodal supervision and human annotations.

Method: DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs bidirectional distillation to enable mutual knowledge exchange between target model and dual supervisions during iterative adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DAM framework effectively integrates multimodal supervision with human annotations through dual supervisory signals and bidirectional distillation, achieving superior performance in source-free active domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for automated assessment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) that simultaneously predicts vertebral endplate angles and coordinates, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual Cobb angle measurements for AIS suffer from significant observer variability, and existing automated methods use simplified spinal models that fail to address clinical complexity.

Method: Combines HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for feature extraction. Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, avoiding predefined curve patterns.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error on 630 full-spine radiographs. Demonstrated exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution cases. Introduced Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI) that showed significant prognostic correlation with curve progression.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring, with VWI offering better prognostic value than traditional Cobb angles.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

TL;DR: Attention Surgery is an efficient framework that linearizes or hybridizes attention in pretrained video diffusion models without full retraining, reducing attention costs by up to 40% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models suffer from quadratic self-attention costs, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. Linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity but prior methods fail to match softmax attention expressiveness without costly retraining.

Method: Combines hybrid attention mechanism (mixing softmax and linear tokens) with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline, plus cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.

Result: Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B VDM, achieves first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40% in FLOPs while maintaining generation quality on VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention Surgery successfully enables efficient sub-quadratic attention in pretrained video diffusion models without compromising quality, requiring only a few GPU-days of training.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large-scale dataset with 80k instruction-image pairs covering 11 domains and 51 subtasks, constructed using hierarchical taxonomy and automated generation, which significantly improves multimodal model performance for image generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multimodal models lack systematic structure and challenging scenarios needed for real-world applications, limiting model performance in image generation and editing tasks.

Method: Used hierarchical task taxonomy combined with automated data generation through structured resource pools and GPT-4o to create diverse instruction-image pairs covering fundamental to complex tasks.

Result: Fine-tuning models on this dataset achieved up to 18% improvement on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% improvement on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic data construction is crucial for advancing multimodal AI capabilities, and the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset effectively addresses current limitations in training data quality and comprehensiveness.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SID is a goal-oriented language-guided navigation approach that uses self-improving demonstrations to enhance agent exploration capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods rely too heavily on shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions.

Method: SID learns an initial agent on shortest-path data, then uses this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. These trajectories provide better demonstrations for training improved agents in an iterative self-improving pipeline that scales to new environments.

Result: SID significantly boosts exploration capabilities and generalization, achieving 50.9% success rate on SOON unseen validation splits (13.9% improvement over prior methods) and new state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and SOON tasks.

Conclusion: The iterative self-improving pipeline with self-generated demonstrations effectively enhances goal-oriented language-guided navigation, demonstrating strong generalization and exploration capabilities across diverse navigation tasks.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

*Tian Xia,Matthew Sinclair,Andreas Schuh,Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Raghav Mehta,Rajat Rasal,Esther Puyol-Antón,Samuel Gerber,Kersten Petersen,Michiel Schaap,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating counterfactual medical images that enables structure-specific interventions without requiring pixel-level labels, producing locally coherent counterfactuals for applications like dataset de-biasing and disease modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual image generation methods rely on external classifiers and are insufficient for structure-specific interventions, often causing undesirable global effects. Previous approaches required tedious pixel-level label maps for guidance.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent counterfactuals without needing hypothetical segmentations.

Result: The method demonstrates capability of generating realistic chest radiographs and shows promising results for modeling coronary artery disease, producing effective counterfactuals with local coherence.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT provides a practical solution for structure-specific counterfactual image generation that avoids the need for pixel-level labels while maintaining intervention effectiveness and local coherence.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling GANs by training in VAE latent space and using transformer-based architectures, addressing scaling issues with intermediate supervision and width-aware learning rates, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalability principles for adversarial learning, which has been underexplored compared to other generative models, by leveraging effective design choices from other domains.

Method: Uses VAE latent space training for efficiency and transformer-based generators/discriminators. Addresses scaling issues with lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment.

Result: GAT-XL/2 achieves FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines, with reliable training across various model capacities.

Conclusion: GANs can be effectively scaled using latent space training and transformer architectures with proper scaling solutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced training time.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos have temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, making it challenging for AI systems to achieve both completeness and efficiency in understanding.

Method: Uses an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) for capturing task-related information and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for verifying key clues and optimizing perception strategies.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and efficiency on multiple datasets, surpassing existing training-free methods on EgoSchema using only 11.2 frames and achieving performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Conclusion: CogniGPT demonstrates that progressive visual cognition through interactive perception-verification loops enables efficient and reliable long video understanding with minimal frame usage.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable confidence estimation in medical AI systems, especially for brain tumor classification where overconfident misclassifications can have serious consequences.

Method: Developed custom CNN trained on merged brain MRI dataset, introduced five types of image noise (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, Uniform), applied Temperature Scaling as post-hoc calibration technique.

Result: TS significantly reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems in noisy or uncertain settings.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

TL;DR: Social 3D Scene Graphs extend traditional 3D Scene Graphs to include humans, their attributes, activities, and relationships with the environment using open-vocabulary framework, enabling better social scene understanding for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Scene Graph approaches largely ignore humans in scenes and lack annotated human-environment relationships, limiting robots' ability to understand social interactions and act in socially compliant ways.

Method: Introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs that capture humans, attributes, activities and relationships in environments using open-vocabulary framework, and create a new benchmark with synthetic environments containing comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations.

Result: Experiments show the representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, demonstrating enhanced social scene understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs pave the way toward socially intelligent robots by enabling better understanding of human-environment interactions and social compliance.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised multi-event representation learning for event-based facial keypoint alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic event datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial keypoint alignment in challenging conditions, but existing RGB methods perform poorly on event data, and training solely on event data suffers from limited spatial information and lack of labeled datasets.

Method: Proposes cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) to integrate RGB data for robust feature extraction from event images, and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for effective feature learning from unlabeled event data.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-event E-SIE dataset and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmark show the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of event-based facial keypoint alignment by leveraging cross-modal guidance and self-supervised learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust segmentation across pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans is crucial for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning, but training generalized models requires diverse annotated data which is often limited.

Method: Uses on-the-fly augmentation with pretrained GliGANs to dynamically insert synthetic tumors during training. Evaluates three nnU-Net-based models: baseline without external augmentation, regular on-the-fly augmented model, and customized on-the-fly augmentation model, with ensemble approach.

Result: Achieved lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on BraTS 2025 validation platform, ranking first in BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1.

Conclusion: The proposed on-the-fly augmentation strategy with GliGANs effectively addresses data limitations and computational constraints, demonstrating superior performance in glioma segmentation across treatment timelines.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBA video generation methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability in applications requiring transparency effects.

Method: Proposes a variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes alpha channel into RGB latent space, and uses a diffusion transformer trained on a constructed high-quality RGBA video dataset.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering compared to state-of-the-art methods. Can generate semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details like hair strands.

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha provides an effective solution for high-quality RGBA video generation with improved transparency handling and visual fidelity.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

### [322] [SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980)
*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose is a fine-tuning framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for human pose estimation by predicting keypoint heatmaps in the diffusion model's latent space, achieving strong performance with minimal training and excellent cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of pre-trained diffusion models for structured outputs like human pose estimation, which remains underexplored despite their success in dense prediction tasks.

Method: Directly predicts keypoint heatmaps in Stable Diffusion's U-Net latent space, uses lightweight convolutional pose head, and incorporates auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch for robustness.

Result: Achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO with only 1/5 training time, sets new SOTA on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD, and works as zero-shot pose annotator for controllable generation.

Conclusion: SDPose effectively leverages diffusion priors for pose estimation with strong generalization and efficiency, demonstrating the versatility of diffusion models beyond generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X is a framework for high-fidelity, controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories, addressing limitations in field-of-view and camera controllability of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the constraints of narrow field-of-view and insufficient camera controllability in existing methods, enabling complete 360-degree visual world generation for free exploration by users or autonomous agents.

Method: Constructs panoramic video-exploration route pairs using Unreal Engine simulations, and introduces a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto spherical surfaces to model geometric adjacency in latent space.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in motion range, control precision, and visual quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications by achieving high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

### [324] [LVT: Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction via Local View Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25001)
*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVT is a transformer-based architecture for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis that avoids quadratic attention complexity by processing only local view neighborhoods with geometric-aware positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers have quadratic complexity that limits scaling to large scenes, while spatially nearby views provide more useful local scene information than distant views.

Method: Processes information in local neighborhoods around each view using novel positional encoding based on relative geometric transformations between query and nearby views, then decodes into 3D Gaussian Splat representation with view-dependent color and opacity.

Result: Enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Conclusion: LVT successfully addresses scalability limitations of standard transformers for 3D vision tasks while maintaining high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

TL;DR: CLASP is a lightweight unsupervised image segmentation framework that uses self-supervised ViT features, spectral clustering, and automatic segment count selection without requiring labeled data or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a simple, training-free method for image segmentation that works on large unannotated datasets, addressing needs in digital advertising and marketing workflows like brand safety screening and content moderation.

Method: Extracts patch features using DINO ViT encoder, builds affinity matrix, applies spectral clustering with automatic segment selection via eigengap silhouette search, and refines boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: Achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines despite requiring no training.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a strong, easily reproducible baseline for unsupervised segmentation that works effectively on large unlabeled datasets common in practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has shown strong reasoning in natural images but remains unexplored for Earth Observation, which has unique challenges like object detection, captioning, change detection, and temporal analysis requiring task-aware reasoning.

Method: Proposed a novel post-training framework that incorporates task-aware rewards to adapt reasoning-based RL models to diverse EO tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art generic and specialized vision language models.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness in Earth Observation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable reinforcement learning framework for autoregressive image generation that addresses gradient conflicts and entropy instability in GRPO algorithms, improving visual quality and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO algorithms struggle with autoregressive image models due to training instability that disrupts pretrained model capabilities, leading to marginal gains, degraded quality, and poor generalization.

Method: STAGE introduces two key solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting with similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting gradient updates from unnecessary tokens, and 2) Entropy reward based on reference model to stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments show STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization across multiple benchmarks compared to baseline GRPO, reducing disruption of pretrained distributions and mitigating reward hacking.

Conclusion: STAGE provides a stable and generalizable framework for reinforcement learning in autoregressive image generation by addressing gradient conflicts and entropy instability, enabling better transfer to other benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL is a novel few-shot learning framework that bridges vision and text using LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks through cross-modal iterative prompting and geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict visual evidence due to lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) that conditions LLMs on class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions, and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) that aligns textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing kernelized volume of 3D parallelotope.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively bridges vision and text with LLMs, providing precise semantic understanding and structured multimodal integration for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration algorithms haven't scaled with image acquisition capabilities, creating bottlenecks for biomedical applications dealing with large datasets like ex-vivo human brain MRI.

Method: Uses IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels and distributed framework with convolution-aware tensor sharding, complementing existing model parallelism techniques by optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks.

Result: Registered 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI at native resolution (570x larger than clinical data) in ~1 minute using 8 A6000 GPUs; 6-7x speedup over SOTA with 20-59% memory reduction; fits 64x larger problems on single GPU.

Conclusion: FFDP enables unprecedented scale in image registration, significantly outperforming existing methods in both performance and efficiency for large-scale biomedical imaging problems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM introduces a cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves faster training, lower memory usage, and improved resolution compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryo-EM reconstruction methods are computationally expensive and memory intensive for large datasets, while recent neural radiance field approaches improve accuracy but have cubic memory/computation overhead.

Method: GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (11 parameters each) and uses a novel gradient computation design to reduce memory footprint and training cost, operating directly in real-space.

Result: GEM achieves up to 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and improves local resolution by up to 38.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard cryo-EM benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: UniLat3D is a unified framework for single-stage 3D asset generation that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, eliminating the need for separate geometry and texture generation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods use two-stage pipelines that first generate geometry then synthesize appearance, leading to geometry-texture misalignment and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes a geometry-appearance Unified VAE that compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact UniLat representation, and trains a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat.

Result: UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The unified single-stage approach with UniLat representation enables efficient and high-fidelity 3D asset generation while avoiding the alignment issues of decoupled pipelines.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a magnitude-adaptive adversarial purification framework that uses frequency-targeted noise injection instead of uniform noise, achieving state-of-the-art robust accuracy by preserving low-frequency semantic content while suppressing high-frequency adversarial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods use uniform noise injection which corrupts semantic structures. The authors discovered that adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with heterogeneous patterns, motivating a frequency-aware approach.

Method: MANI-Pure leverages magnitude spectrum analysis to guide purification. It adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise that suppresses adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving low-frequency semantic content.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, MANI-Pure narrows clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware, magnitude-adaptive purification is more effective than uniform noise injection for adversarial defense, as it preserves semantic content while effectively suppressing targeted adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: Triangle Splatting+ directly optimizes triangles within a differentiable splatting framework, enabling real-time mesh-based novel view synthesis without post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are incompatible with mesh-based pipelines used in VR and graphics applications, and conversion solutions degrade quality and increase complexity.

Method: Direct optimization of triangles with shared vertex connectivity in a differentiable splatting framework, using a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets, surpassing prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The method produces semi-connected meshes that are immediately usable in standard graphics engines and support downstream applications like physics simulation and interactive walkthroughs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is successfully extended to text-to-image flow-matching models, demonstrating that score distillation techniques work broadly across diffusion and flow-based generators without requiring architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow iterative sampling. While distillation methods help, there's uncertainty about whether these techniques transfer to flow matching models, which are theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions.

Method: A simple derivation based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching. SiD is extended to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models (SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, FLUX.1-dev) with DiT backbones, using only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments.

Result: SiD works out of the box across all tested models in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models.

Conclusion: Score distillation techniques are broadly applicable to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness, and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

### [337] [TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143)
*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench is the first benchmark for analyzing patient condition changes across clinical visits using temporal medical images, revealing LVLMs' limitations in temporal reasoning and showing multi-modal retrieval augmentation improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks focus on single-visit analysis, which deviates from real clinical practice where doctors track patient changes over time using historical data.

Method: Created TemMed-Bench with three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and 17K+ knowledge corpus. Evaluated 6 proprietary and 6 open-source LVLMs, tested multi-modal retrieval augmentation combining visual and textual modalities.

Result: Most LVLMs lack temporal reasoning ability, with many performing at random-guessing level. GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed best but still insufficient performance. Multi-modal retrieval improved VQA by average 2.59% over no retrieval or text-only retrieval.

Conclusion: LVLMs have significant limitations in temporal medical image reasoning. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation shows promise for addressing this challenge and should be further explored.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

### [338] [Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$): A Predictive Representation of Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25146)
*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast Feature Field (F³) is a novel representation for event-based camera data that learns by predicting future events from past events, enabling efficient downstream tasks like optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for event-based camera data that preserve scene structure and motion information while being robust to noise and varying event rates.

Method: Uses multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets to learn F³ by predicting future events from past events, exploiting sparsity of event data.

Result: Achieves 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions for F³ computation, and 25-75 Hz for downstream tasks. State-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation across various robotic platforms and conditions.

Conclusion: F³ provides an efficient, robust representation for event-based vision that enables high-performance downstream applications across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

### [339] [VideoAnchor: Reinforcing Subspace-Structured Visual Cues for Coherent Visual-Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25151)
*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor is a plug-and-play module that improves visual-spatial reasoning in MLLMs by leveraging subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have limitations in visual-spatial reasoning because visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens in attention mechanisms, preventing consistent recognition of visual cues across frames.

Method: Proposes VideoAnchor module that connects self-expressiveness property from sparse subspace clustering with attention mechanism in Transformers, using subspace affinities to anchor attention to shared visual structures.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains: 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B, with qualitative improvements in subspace partitions and visual grounding.

Conclusion: VideoAnchor effectively addresses visual-spatial reasoning limitations in MLLMs through subspace affinity-based attention anchoring, demonstrating plug-and-play effectiveness across different backbone models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

### [340] [GSM8K-V: Can Vision Language Models Solve Grade School Math Word Problems in Visual Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25160)
*Fan Yuan,Yuchen Yan,Yifan Jiang,Haoran Zhao,Tao Feng,Jinyan Chen,Yanwei Lou,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark created by converting text-based GSM8K problems into visual form, revealing significant performance gaps in current vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry, lack math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images, creating a gap in comprehensive evaluation of VLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Systematically mapped text-based GSM8K samples into visual form using an automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, creating 1,319 high-quality visual samples.

Result: Current VLMs show substantial performance gap: best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves 95.22% on text-based GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V, indicating significant room for improvement in visual mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new benchmark for evaluating visual mathematical reasoning, highlighting limitations of current models and guiding development of more robust and generalizable vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

### [341] [Rolling Forcing: Autoregressive Long Video Diffusion in Real Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25161)
*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation through joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from severe error accumulation that degrades video quality over long horizons, limiting their practical use in interactive world models and neural game engines.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressive noise levels to suppress error growth; 2) Attention sink mechanism to maintain global context from initial frames; 3) Efficient training algorithm for few-step distillation over extended denoising windows.

Result: Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Conclusion: The proposed Rolling Forcing technique effectively addresses error accumulation in streaming video generation, making it suitable for practical applications requiring high-quality, low-latency, and temporally coherent long video streams.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

### [342] [Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25162)
*Bowei Chen,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,He Zhang,Tianyuan Zhang,Zhengqi Li,Yuanjun Xiong,Jianming Zhang,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers for latent diffusion models, using a three-stage alignment strategy to create semantically rich tokenizers that accelerate diffusion model convergence and improve image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders rather than training VAEs from scratch, which primarily focus on low-level details, in order to create better tokenizers for diffusion models.

Method: A three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze encoder and train adapter/decoder to establish semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with semantic preservation loss; (3) refine decoder for improved reconstruction quality.

Result: Achieved gFID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256 within 64 epochs, accelerating diffusion model convergence. A 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with this tokenizer consistently outperformed FLUX VAE under same training steps on LAION dataset.

Conclusion: The method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design that benefits diffusion models in both convergence speed and generation quality.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a visual in-context learning framework that uses diffusion transformers to perform personalized vision tasks from a single annotated example, without requiring fine-tuning or synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models struggle with personalized tasks defined at test time, and existing personalization methods rely on costly fine-tuning or inflexible synthetic data pipelines that can't handle open-ended personalization.

Method: Uses a four-panel framework with diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners, constructs VisRel dataset for task diversity, and implements attention-guided seed scorer for reliable inference.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Task diversity rather than scale drives robust generalization in visual in-context learning, enabling effective personalized vision without retraining.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD) is proposed to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by contrasting output distributions from shallow vs deep visual features, achieving state-of-the-art performance on hallucination benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations - generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with input image context, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.

Method: LayerCD contrasts output distributions generated from shallow vs deep visual features of vision encoder, filtering hallucinations by leveraging that shallow features are more likely to cause hallucinations due to capturing only biased, low-level information.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks show LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LayerCD effectively reduces hallucinations in MLLMs by leveraging the observation that shallow visual features are more prone to causing hallucinations than deep visual features.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is an automated method that generates natural-looking images to induce object hallucinations in MLLMs by optimizing in image embedding space, achieving high hallucination rates and uncovering transferable vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks for studying object hallucination in MLLMs are limited and cannot uncover model-specific or unanticipated vulnerabilities. There's a need for active testing methods that can systematically expose hallucination weaknesses.

Method: GHOST optimizes in the image embedding space to create misleading cues while keeping target objects absent, then uses a diffusion model to generate natural-looking images from these embeddings. The method is fully automatic and requires no human supervision.

Result: GHOST achieved hallucination success rates exceeding 28% across various models, compared to ~1% in prior methods. It also uncovered transferable vulnerabilities - images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induced hallucinations in GPT-4o at 66.5% rate. Generated images were confirmed high-quality and object-free.

Conclusion: GHOST serves as both a diagnostic tool for uncovering hallucination vulnerabilities and a corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems, as fine-tuning on GHOST-generated images helps mitigate hallucination.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Gen accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by using a deeply compressed latent space with embedding alignment and LoRA fine-tuning, achieving 53x speedup for 4K generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models face efficiency challenges at high resolutions like 4K, and previous research rarely addresses latent space redundancy.

Method: Post-training pipeline with lightweight embedding alignment to bridge representation gap, followed by minimal LoRA fine-tuning to preserve base model quality.

Result: DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX achieve comparable quality to base models with 53x latency reduction for 4K generation on H100 GPU, and 138x reduction with NVFP4 SVDQuant on 5090 GPU.

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides an efficient framework for accelerating high-resolution text-to-image generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than
their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable
2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU. Code:

Result: Reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations in a category-agnostic way, showing robust performance across challenging scenarios with substantial deformation and camera movement.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates strong potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by effectively handling complex deformable object reconstruction from casual monocular videos.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

### [350] [PixelCraft: A Multi-Agent System for High-Fidelity Visual Reasoning on Structured Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25185)
*Shuoshuo Zhang,Zijian Li,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Jun Zhang,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft is a multi-agent system that improves visual reasoning on structured images (charts, diagrams) by combining high-fidelity image processing with flexible reasoning through dynamic tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured images pose challenges for MLLMs due to perceptual errors cascading into wrong conclusions. Existing cue-based methods have limitations with low-fidelity processing and rigid reasoning patterns.

Method: Multi-agent system with dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, and visual tool agents. Uses fine-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization integrated with CV algorithms, plus dynamic three-stage workflow with image memory for adaptive reasoning.

Result: Significantly improves visual reasoning performance on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks, setting new standard for structured image reasoning.

Conclusion: PixelCraft effectively addresses structured image reasoning challenges through high-fidelity processing and flexible multi-agent reasoning approach.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

### [351] [FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187)
*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V addresses conditional image leakage in Image-to-Video generation by using latent shifting and Fourier guidance to prevent overfitting and improve out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V methods suffer from conditional image leakage where denoisers shortcut the conditional image, causing slow motion, color inconsistency, and poor generalization to out-of-domain data.

Method: FlashI2V uses two key techniques: (1) Latent Shifting - modifies flow matching distributions by subtracting conditional image information from noisy latents, (2) Fourier Guidance - uses high-frequency magnitude features from Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and adjust detail levels.

Result: FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V with only 1.3B parameters, outperforming larger models like CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves superior generalization and performance on out-of-domain data compared to various I2V paradigms.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [352] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw is a self-supervised post-training framework that enhances MLLMs' visual understanding through a jigsaw puzzle task where models reconstruct shuffled visual partitions by predicting correct permutations in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training for MLLMs is predominantly text-centric, using visual inputs only to extract sparse cues for text reasoning. There's a need for vision-centric approaches that directly enhance visual understanding without relying on text mediators or additional visual generative components.

Method: Visual Jigsaw formulates visual understanding as a general ordering task: visual inputs are partitioned and shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by producing the correct permutation in natural language. It uses reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards without requiring annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across image, video, and 3D data modalities.

Conclusion: Visual Jigsaw demonstrates the potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and aims to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs for enhancing visual understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

### [353] [VGGT-X: When VGGT Meets Dense Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25191)
*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-X addresses VRAM and output quality issues when scaling 3D Foundation Models to dense novel view synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art COLMAP-free results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS methods rely on slow and fragile SfM pipelines. 3DFMs offer speed but struggle with dense views due to high VRAM usage and imperfect outputs that degrade 3D training.

Method: VGGT-X combines memory-efficient VGGT scaling to 1000+ images, adaptive global alignment for output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices.

Result: Substantially closes fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving SOTA in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.

Conclusion: Provides insights for future 3D foundation model development and demonstrates viable COLMAP-free dense NVS pipeline.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is
