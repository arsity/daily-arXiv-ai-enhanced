### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an alternative to Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection, achieving faster convergence and state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatmap regression methods use Soft-argmax as a differentiable approximation for argmax, but this may not be the optimal approach for facial landmark detection.

Method: The authors propose a training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework as an alternative to Soft-argmax.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on WFLW, COFW, and 300W benchmarks, converges 2.2x faster during training, and maintains competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Soft-argmax is not the only viable approach for facial landmark detection, and structured prediction-based methods can offer superior training efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel integration of Graph Convolutional Networks with Voronoi diagrams for image classification, representing images as graphs and refining them with Delaunay triangulations to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image classification by leveraging GCNs' ability to model relational data and overcome limitations of conventional CNNs, particularly for complex scenes and fine-grained categories.

Method: Represents images as graphs with pixels/regions as vertices, refines graphs using Delaunay triangulations, and integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for optimized representation.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of GCNs with Voronoi diagrams presents a novel perspective for image classification and expands graph-based learning applications in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO is a single-stage, query-based framework that unifies object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation using only RGB images, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional data like depth or CAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. The authors aim to create a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level without additional data.

Method: YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels.

Result: YOPO sets new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks. On REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under the 10°10cm metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: Object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be unified with high performance using only RGB images, demonstrating that a single-stage, query-based framework can achieve excellent results without additional data requirements.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks using paired-sampling contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional face recognition systems use separate models for physical and digital spoofing detection, increasing complexity and latency while leaving systems vulnerable to combined attacks.

Method: Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that leverages automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues through contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 2.10% average classification error rate (ACER) on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach effectively detects both physical and digital spoofing attacks while being computationally efficient and practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen is a training-free black-box method that efficiently generates adversarial images using only 3-20 sampling steps from diffusion models, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks from generative models produce low-quality images and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation, making them inefficient.

Method: TAIGen injects perturbations during the mixing step interval without processing all timesteps. It uses a selective RGB channel strategy: attention maps on red channel and GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels to preserve structure while maximizing misclassification.

Result: TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet on ImageNet. It maintains PSNR above 30 dB and generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks.

Conclusion: TAIGen is the most impactful attack method as it achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating defense mechanisms are least successful in purifying images generated by this approach.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ is a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement that addresses concealed visual perception by combining reversible modeling across mask and RGB domains with a targeted diffusion model for uncertainty refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods are limited to mask domain reversible strategies and fail to exploit the potential of RGB domain information, leaving uncertainty issues unresolved.

Method: Formulates CVP as optimization problem unfolded into multi-stage network with three modules: CORE (mask domain reversible modeling), CARE (RGB domain reversible modeling), and FINE (targeted Bernoulli diffusion model for uncertain regions).

Result: The approach efficiently directs focus to ambiguous areas, significantly reducing false positives/negatives while avoiding prohibitive computational costs of full-image diffusion processes.

Conclusion: RUN++ introduces a new paradigm for robust CVP systems that remain effective under real-world degradations and establishes a broader bi-level optimization framework for the field.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow introduces curvature-aware flow matching with non-linear trajectories to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image generation, outperforming existing rectified flow methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rectified flow models use linear trajectories that force generation through low-probability regions, potentially harming semantic alignment between generated images and text captions.

Method: A flow matching framework with curvature regularization that learns smooth non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MS COCO datasets, significantly outperforming standard rectified flow variants and non-linear baselines, with notable improvements in semantic consistency metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CLAIR).

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances instructional compliance while maintaining high image quality, demonstrating the importance of non-linear trajectories for faithful text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA is a self-supervised, opinion-unaware NR-IQA framework that uses hierarchical ranking and quality alignment to predict image quality scores without pristine references or auxiliary modalities at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-IQA methods suffer from dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels, limiting their generalization performance. The need for frameworks that work without pristine references or auxiliary modalities at inference time.

Method: Combines ranking and contrastive learning with a novel higher-order ranking loss for relational ordering across distortion pairs, embedding distance loss for feature-perceptual consistency, and training-time contrastive alignment guided by textual prompts.

Result: HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations (lens flare, haze, motion blur, low-light) despite being trained only on synthetic distortions. HiRQA-S variant achieves 3.5 ms inference time per image. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and authentic benchmarks.

Conclusion: HiRQA offers a scalable, self-supervised approach to NR-IQA with strong generalization capabilities and real-time deployment potential through its lightweight variant HiRQA-S.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments with spatiotemporal disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications in emergency response and tactical scenarios require near-real-time performance in dynamic edge environments, but suffer from reliability issues due to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy using genetic algorithm optimization to solve camera selection problems, ensuring reliable reconstruction despite spatiotemporal disruptions.

Result: The proposed camera selection strategy demonstrates benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction compared to traditional baseline strategies under spatiotemporal disruptions, using both publicly available and customized 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The portfolio theory approach provides an effective solution for maintaining reconstruction quality in dynamic edge environments with correlated disruptions, offering improved reliability over conventional methods.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XDR-LVLM is a novel framework that combines Vision-Language Large Models for accurate diabetic retinopathy diagnosis with natural language explanations, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable diagnostic reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparency and interpretability in deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy detection, which hinders clinical adoption despite their promising performance.

Method: Proposes XDR-LVLM framework with specialized Medical Vision Encoder, LVLM Core, Multi-task Prompt Engineering, and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to analyze fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with explanations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 84.55% Balanced Accuracy and 79.92% F1 Score for disease diagnosis, plus 77.95% BACC and 66.88% F1 for concept detection. Human evaluations confirm high fluency and clinical utility of explanations.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully bridges the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing both accurate DR detection and interpretable natural language explanations, making it suitable for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [12] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,Rüdiger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeSS is a method for generating high-quality, style-consistent outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric priors, combining image diffusion models with cross-view consistency improvements and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: City mesh models lack realistic textures, limiting their use in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. Existing image/video diffusion models have limitations - video models struggle with camera path adherence, while image models lack cross-view consistency.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets, 2) Propagate denser intermediate views via AGInpaint, 3) Globally eliminate visual inconsistencies with GCAlign module. Simultaneously reconstruct 3D Gaussian Splatting scene by initializing Gaussian balls on mesh surface.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Generated scenes can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Conclusion: MeSS successfully addresses the texture limitation of city mesh models by generating high-quality, style-consistent outdoor scenes with improved geometric alignment and cross-view consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgWound is the first open-source dataset for surgical wound screening with 697 images annotated by surgeons, enabling benchmark development and a three-stage MLLM framework (WoundQwen) for comprehensive wound diagnosis and personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of publicly available surgical wound datasets and benchmarks, overcoming data privacy concerns and high annotation costs that hinder deep learning progress in surgical wound screening and SSI prevention.

Method: Three-stage learning framework: (1) Five MLLMs predict specific wound characteristics, (2) Two MLLMs use these predictions to diagnose infection risk and guide interventions, (3) Final MLLM integrates results to generate comprehensive reports.

Result: Created SurgWound dataset with 697 surgical wound images and eight fine-grained clinical attributes, established first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis including VQA and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enables detailed surgical wound analysis, provides patient instructions based on images, and paves the way for personalized wound care, timely intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyMorph-B2I is a dynamic morphology-guided pipeline that converts binary semantic masks to instance-level segmentation for renal pathology analysis, outperforming traditional methods through integrated watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations with adaptive refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing renal pathology datasets and methods only provide binary semantic masks, limiting precision for morphological quantification. Traditional post-processing techniques are insufficient for handling diverse morphologies and complex connectivity in renal tissue.

Method: Integrated watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework with adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of renal functional unit.

Result: Outperforms individual classical approaches and naive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I provides a robust solution for converting binary masks to instance-level segmentation, facilitating precise morphological quantification in renal pathology analysis.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGNet model improves accident prediction from dash-cam videos using enhanced spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks, outperforming previous methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective accident prediction system using only dash-cam video input, which is more challenging but more deployable than sensor-based systems, to improve road safety through timely warnings.

Method: Incorporates better spatio-temporal features and aggregates them through a recurrent network to enhance graph neural networks for accident prediction from dash-cam videos.

Result: Achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods on three publicly available datasets, with strong performance in both cross-validation and cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed STAGNet model provides an effective and deployable solution for accident prediction using only dash-cam video, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [17] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM is the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that leverages multiple modalities (RGB, RGBD, point clouds) for superior 3D asset generation, achieving competitive performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models either operate in single-modality paradigms, missing complementary benefits of multi-modal data, or are limited to 3D structures, restricting available training datasets. Multi-modal data offers distinct advantages - RGB images provide textures while point clouds define geometries.

Method: 1) Collaborative multi-modal coding that integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique strengths. 2) Auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision to enhance robustness and performance. 3) Triplane latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D assets with improved texture and geometric detail.

Result: Extensive experiments show TriMM achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets despite using small training data. Additional experiments verify feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets (RGB-D) into 3D generation.

Conclusion: TriMM successfully harnesses multi-modal data for 3D modeling, demonstrating that effectively leveraging multiple modalities enables high-quality 3D generation with limited training data and opens possibilities for incorporating diverse multi-modal datasets.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework that addresses prototype drift and inter-class conflicts through soft prototype weighting and dual consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering suffer from prototype drift (deviation between calculated prototypes and true cluster centers) and inter-class conflicts, which limit clustering performance.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) Soft prototype contrastive module that uses sample-to-center probability as weights to calculate prototypes, reducing drift and conflicts; 2) Dual consistency learning module that aligns different transformations of same samples and neighborhoods of different samples for transformation-invariant semantics and compact intra-cluster distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework effectively addresses prototype drift and inter-class conflict problems, achieving superior clustering performance through soft prototype weighting and dual consistency learning.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aerial VLN task using dual UAVs at different altitudes - high-altitude for environmental reasoning and low-altitude for precise navigation, with a new dataset and collaborative framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UAV visual-language navigation caused by extended trajectories and complex maneuverability by leveraging multi-grained perspectives from different altitudes while maintaining manageable motion space.

Method: Introduce DuAl-VLN task with two UAVs at distinct altitudes, create HaL-13k dataset with 13,838 collaborative trajectories, and propose AeroDuo framework using multimodal LLM for high-altitude reasoning and lightweight policy for low-altitude navigation.

Result: Developed a comprehensive dataset and collaborative framework that enables systematic evaluation of generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets through minimal coordinate exchange between UAVs.

Conclusion: The dual-UAV collaborative approach effectively combines high-level environmental reasoning with precise low-altitude navigation, providing a scalable solution for aerial VLN tasks with improved efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skipped-step sampling enables faster diffusion model generation by bypassing intermediate denoising steps while maintaining quality, showing acceleration is an intrinsic property of pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sequential generation process of diffusion models and understand if original diffusion processes can achieve efficiency without non-Markovian approaches like DDIM.

Method: Proposes skipped-step sampling that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, derived from the same training objective as standard diffusion models.

Result: Achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps across popular pretrained models including OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models.

Conclusion: Accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling in a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, and integration with DDIM further enhances generation efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

TL;DR: Comp-X is the first LLM-powered interactive image compression system that intelligently handles diverse coding requirements through natural language interaction, unifying multiple coding modes into a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs have limited coding modes and require manual mode selection by engineers, making them inaccessible for non-professional users who need to compress images for various purposes.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Multi-functional coding framework unifying different coding modes, 2) Interactive coding agent using augmented in-context learning with expert feedback, 3) IIC-bench benchmark with diverse user requests and expert annotations.

Result: Comp-X efficiently understands coding requests and achieves impressive textual interaction capability while maintaining comparable compression performance with a single framework.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising avenue for applying artificial general intelligence to image compression, making compression more accessible and intelligent through natural language interaction.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face

*Han Li,Shaofei Huang,Longfei Xu,Yulu Gao,Beipeng Mu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RATopo introduces a redundancy assignment strategy for lane topology reasoning that enables one-to-many supervision through decoder restructuring and parallel cross-attention blocks, improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use first-detect-then-reason paradigm with one-to-one assignment, resulting in suboptimal topology reasoning due to limited valid supervision range.

Method: Restructures Transformer decoder by swapping cross-attention and self-attention layers to retain redundant predictions before suppression, and uses multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters to enhance lane diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 show RATopo is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates into existing frameworks, and consistently improves both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.

Conclusion: The proposed redundancy assignment strategy enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision, overcoming limitations of traditional one-to-one assignment approaches in lane topology reasoning.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

TL;DR: DesignCLIP leverages CLIP models for design patent analysis, addressing limitations of traditional image-based methods by incorporating class-aware classification, contrastive learning, and multimodal approaches to improve patent classification and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional design patent analysis relies heavily on patent images (sketches) which often lack comprehensive visual context and semantic information, leading to ambiguities in prior art searches. Recent vision-language models like CLIP offer opportunities for more reliable AI-driven patent analysis.

Method: Developed DesignCLIP framework using CLIP models with class-aware classification and contrastive learning. Utilized generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-view image learning. Built on a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents.

Result: DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models in patent classification and retrieval tasks. Also enables multimodal patent retrieval, offering diverse sources of inspiration for design creativity.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches show significant promise in advancing patent analysis. The framework demonstrates effectiveness across various downstream tasks and provides potential for enhancing design innovation through more comprehensive patent analysis.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA is a novel framework for fetal congenital heart defect classification in ultrasound videos that combines temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated CHD detection methods neglect temporal information, limit to binary classification, and lack prediction calibration, which hinders clinical reliability in ultrasound video analysis.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) extracts frame features with image encoder, aggregates with temporal extractor, aligns with class-specific text prompts via contrastive loss, and uses CVAESM module for uncertainty quantification and style modulation.

Result: TPA achieves 85.40% macro F1 for CHD diagnosis, reduces calibration error by 5.38-6.8%, and boosts EchoNet-Dynamic three-class task performance by 4.73% to 58.62% macro F1.

Conclusion: TPA effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating temporal modeling, prompt learning, and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating superior performance and improved calibration for clinical ultrasound applications.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR: First multimodal dataset combining LiDAR and cameras for basketball player tracking, enabling real-time 3D MOT with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-camera systems struggle with real-time 3D player tracking due to 2D video limitations and complex reconstruction. Basketball presents extreme MOT challenges with rapid movements, occlusions, and physical contact in confined spaces.

Method: Created BasketLiDAR dataset with 4,445 frames, 3,105 player IDs from synchronized LiDAR sensors and multi-view cameras. Developed novel MOT algorithm using LiDAR's 3D spatial information with two pipelines: LiDAR-only real-time tracking and multimodal LiDAR-camera fusion.

Result: Achieved real-time operation (previously difficult with camera-only methods) with superior tracking performance even under occlusion conditions.

Conclusion: The multimodal LiDAR-camera approach overcomes limitations of traditional camera systems, enabling accurate real-time 3D player tracking in challenging basketball scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG is a training-free paradigm for camouflaged object detection that uses retrieval-augmented generation for prompt creation and SAM-based segmentation for refinement, achieving competitive performance without conventional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camouflaged object detection is challenging due to high object-background similarity. Existing methods require heavy training and computational resources, while foundation models like SAM need high-quality prompts that are costly to generate manually.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) creates coarse masks as prompts via unsupervised clustering and feature retrieval, 2) SAM-based segmentation (SEG) refines the masks using SAM2 with the generated prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark COD datasets, while being computationally efficient enough to run on a personal laptop.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG provides an effective training-free solution for COD that maintains competitive performance while eliminating the need for conventional training and heavy computational resources.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Conclusion: VideoEraser provides an effective training-free solution to prevent generation of harmful content in text-to-video models, addressing critical safety and ethical concerns while maintaining high performance across multiple erasure tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need to predict pedestrian intentions from a distance to navigate safely, requiring systems that can anticipate road crossing behavior.

Method: Combined pose detection models with sequence modeling techniques (GRU, LSTM, 1D CNN) for temporal predictions using video analysis in an end-to-end deep learning framework.

Result: GRU was better at predicting intent than LSTM, while 1D CNN was the fastest model among the three sequence modeling approaches tested.

Conclusion: The integrated pose detection and sequence modeling framework effectively predicts pedestrian road crossing intentions, with different models offering trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic empirical study using attention knockouts to understand how Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) internally process video content, revealing key insights about layer functionality and spatial-temporal modeling mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Video-LLM research focuses on performance improvement rather than understanding internal mechanisms. This work aims to bridge this gap by systematically analyzing how these models process and understand video content internally.

Method: The authors use attention knockouts as the primary analytical tool, designing three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. They apply these knockouts across different layer windows with global and fine-grained settings to study model behavior.

Result: Key findings: (1) Video information extraction occurs primarily in early layers with a two-stage process (perceptual encoding in lower layers, abstract reasoning in higher layers); (2) Certain intermediate layers have outsized impact while most contribute minimally; (3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than expensive self-attention among video tokens.

Conclusion: The study provides the first systematic understanding of Video-LLM internal processing, revealing interpretability insights that can be leveraged to reduce attention computation costs while maintaining performance, offering both interpretability and efficiency benefits for future research.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune is an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes specific layers instead of all parameters, reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning updates all model parameters, which can lead to overfitting and high computational costs. There's a need for more efficient transfer learning methods that maintain performance while reducing resource requirements.

Method: BioTune uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify and selectively fine-tune only the most relevant layers for a given target task, rather than updating all model parameters.

Result: Evaluation across nine image classification datasets shows BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like AutoRGN and LoRA, while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: BioTune enables more efficient transfer learning by focusing fine-tuning on relevant layers, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance across diverse datasets and domains.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer is a novel compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves kilobyte-range compression while enabling post-archival scene updates through image-conditioned decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods only achieve megabyte-range compression and lack mechanisms for handling scene changes after long-term archival, making them impractical for large-scale scenes or archival use.

Method: Proposes an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer that jointly exploits inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations, uses shared codebooks across scenes, and enables conditional decoding based on images captured at decoding time.

Result: ICGS-Quantizer reduces 3DGS storage requirements to kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for archival deployment of 3DGS by achieving substantial compression and enabling scene updates after archiving through image-conditioned decoding.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat is a 3D scene reconstruction method for driving scenarios that improves novel-view synthesis by using neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization, and geometric supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for driving scenarios overlook background optimization with proper geometry relationships and rely too heavily on fitting individual training views, resulting in limited robustness for novel views and inaccurate geometric representations.

Method: Uses neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization (near/middle/far regions), deformable neural Gaussians for non-rigid dynamic actors with learnable deformation network, and supervision from depth and normal priors from pre-trained models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo and KITTI datasets for novel-view synthesis in driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveSplat provides high-quality reconstruction for driving scenarios by addressing motion blur and geometric accuracy issues through improved initialization, dynamic modeling, and geometric supervision.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

*Ruizhuo Song,Beiming Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the abstract reasoning bottleneck in deep learning by focusing on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems. It adopts a causal chain modeling approach but finds limitations in mutual information maximization, leading to three proposed improvement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the abstract reasoning capabilities of machine intelligence by solving RPM problems, which serve as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating core intelligence dimensions like abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving.

Method: Adopts a "causal chain modeling" perspective to analyze RPM tasks: image → abstract attributes → progressive attribute patterns → pattern consistency → correct answer. Designs the DIO baseline model but identifies limitations in mutual information maximization, leading to three progressive improvement methods.

Result: Experiments reveal that the optimization objective (maximizing variational lower bound of mutual information between context and correct option) fails to enable genuine acquisition of human reasoning logic due to tightness of lower bound and inability to capture causal relationships.

Conclusion: The paper proposes three improvement methods to overcome the limitations of mutual information maximization in capturing causal relationships and enabling genuine acquisition of human reasoning logic in abstract reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

TL;DR: SpiVG Network uses spiking neural networks and variational inference for efficient video summarization, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with global temporal dependencies, semantic coherence, and noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: Combines SNN-based keyframe extractor, Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for frame reasoning, and Variational Inference Reconstruction Module with ELBO optimization to handle feature fusion noise.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS datasets.

Conclusion: SpiVG effectively addresses key challenges in video summarization through spiking neural networks and variational inference, achieving superior performance with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAE hyperparameters (masking ratio, patch size) control spatial correlation learning - short-range vs long-range features. Analytical framework shows how to select optimal parameters for different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Autoencoders require extensive hyperparameter tuning for new datasets, but the connection between hyperparameters and downstream performance is poorly understood. This work aims to bridge that gap by analyzing how MAEs learn spatial correlations.

Method: Analytical derivation of features learned by linear MAEs, extension to non-linear MAEs, and investigation of how masking ratio and patch size affect spatial correlation learning beyond second-order statistics.

Result: MAE representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset. Masking ratio and patch size can be tuned to select features capturing either short-range or long-range spatial correlations, providing a principled way for hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical insights and practical guidance for selecting MAE hyperparameters based on the spatial correlation properties of target datasets, reducing the need for extensive empirical tuning.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIRD is a bidirectional temporal propagation method for infrared small target detection that simultaneously utilizes local and global temporal information across entire video clips, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sliding-window-based methods for moving infrared small target detection ignore global temporal information outside the window and suffer from redundant computation and sub-optimal performance due to lack of joint optimization of entire video clips.

Method: Proposes BIRD with bidirectional propagation strategy: 1) Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between target frame and adjacent frames, 2) Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module to aggregate global propagation features with local fusion features, 3) Joint optimization using detection loss and Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining fast inference speed.

Conclusion: The bidirectional propagation approach effectively captures both local and global temporal information, enabling joint optimization of entire video clips and superior performance in moving infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional car damage inspection is manual, time-consuming, and unreliable for detecting tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents. There's increasing demand for faster, more precise automated inspection methods.

Method: Used YOLOv8 object recognition framework with custom variants (YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42). Created a bespoke dataset with annotated car surface images under various conditions. Employed real-time data augmentation for robustness.

Result: YOLOv8m-t42 model achieved precision: 0.86, recall: 0.84, F1-score: 0.85, mAP@0.5: 0.60, and PR curve area: 0.88, outperforming YOLOv8m-t4 model. Demonstrated excellent detection accuracy with low inference latency.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based solution provides effective real-time detection of microscopic car surface defects, making it suitable for practical applications like automated insurance assessments and vehicle inspections, despite slightly slower convergence.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

TL;DR: MATR is a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval that uses dual-stage sequence alignment and self-supervised pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-to-video moment retrieval requires semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: MATR uses transformer architecture with dual-stage sequence alignment to condition target video representations on query features, plus self-supervised pre-training by localizing random clips within videos.

Result: Achieves 13.1% R@1 and 8.1% mIoU improvement on ActivityNet-VRL, and 14.7% R@1 and 14.4% mIoU gain on new SportsMoments dataset over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MATR effectively addresses video-to-video moment retrieval challenges through transformer-based alignment and self-supervised pre-training, demonstrating significant performance improvements across datasets.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse inputs (only 2 views), achieving state-of-the-art performance with 2.75dB PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires dense multi-view inputs with precise camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. SfM fails with extremely sparse views, leading to degraded rendering quality.

Method: Proposes dense stereo module for camera pose estimation and global dense point cloud initialization, coherent view interpolation for additional supervision, and multi-scale regularization techniques for enhanced geometry and rendering quality.

Result: Significantly outperforms other 3DGS-based approaches with 2.75dB PSNR improvement using only 2 training views. Produces images with minimal distortion and rich high-frequency details.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS in sparse-view scenarios by eliminating SfM dependency and introducing novel modules for pose estimation and scene reconstruction, achieving superior visual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet is a lightweight medical image segmentation framework that combines heterogeneous intra-layer kernels and sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating excellent generalization across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for lightweight and generalizable medical image segmentation models in resource-constrained clinical settings, overcoming limitations of existing lightweight models that compromise performance for efficiency and lack global contextual perception capabilities.

Method: Proposes LGMSNet framework using heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while mitigating channel redundancy, and integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information.

Result: Extensive experiments across six public datasets show LGMSNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: LGMSNet demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios, offering a lightweight yet high-performance solution for medical image segmentation with excellent generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MExECON is a multi-view 3D reconstruction pipeline for clothed human avatars that extends ECON to leverage multiple viewpoints without retraining, using joint body optimization and normal map integration for improved geometry and detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction of clothed human avatars from sparse multi-view images by extending single-view methods to leverage multiple viewpoints for better geometry, body pose estimation, and surface detail capture.

Method: Uses Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) to fit SMPL-X body model across all views with multi-view consistency, then integrates normal maps from front and back views to add geometric details without network retraining.

Result: Consistently improves fidelity over single-view baseline and achieves competitive performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MExECON successfully extends single-view reconstruction to multi-view settings, demonstrating improved accuracy in capturing clothing folds, hairstyles, and overall geometry without requiring additional training.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse is a novel multimodal image fusion framework that uses adaptive wavelet transform and spatial-frequency mamba blocks to achieve superior fusion performance across multiple tasks with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods face challenges with modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations. There's a need for a generalized framework that can handle diverse multimodal fusion tasks effectively.

Method: Proposes AdaSFFuse with two key innovations: Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks (IVF, MFF, MEF, MIF) demonstrate superior fusion performance with low computational cost and compact network architecture.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse provides a strong balance between performance and efficiency, offering a robust solution for generalized multimodal image fusion across diverse applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: ExtraGS is a novel framework for synthesizing extrapolated driving scene views that combines geometric and generative priors using Road Surface Gaussians and Far Field Gaussians with self-supervised uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view extrapolation in driving scenes suffer from poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings when using generative priors as pseudo ground truth.

Method: Proposes ExtraGS with Road Surface Gaussian (RSG) representation using hybrid Gaussian-SDF design, Far Field Gaussians (FFG) with learnable scaling factors, and self-supervised uncertainty estimation via spherical harmonics for selective generative prior integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ExtraGS significantly enhances realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views while maintaining high fidelity along original trajectories across multiple datasets and camera setups.

Conclusion: The holistic integration of geometric and generative priors with specialized Gaussian representations and uncertainty-aware fusion enables superior extrapolated view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch is a two-stage method for vector sketch animation that handles multi-object interactions and complex motions through motion initialization with semantic grouping and a Group-based Displacement Network for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch animation methods struggle with multi-object interactions and complex motions, being limited to single-object cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Motion Initialization - interactive semantic grouping and key frame definition with interpolation, 2) Motion Refinement - Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) with Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement for temporal consistency, leveraging text-to-video model priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex multi-object sketches.

Conclusion: GroupSketch expands practical applications of sketch animation by effectively handling multi-object interactions and complex motions while maintaining temporal consistency.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet is a novel network for extracting narrow roads from remote sensing imagery using dilated dual-stream differential attention fusion to address challenges of limited width, fragmentation, and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to limited width, fragmented topology, and frequent occlusions that conventional models struggle with.

Method: Proposes D3FNet with three innovations: Differential Attention Dilation Extraction module, Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism, and multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1,3,5,9) built on D-LinkNet backbone.

Result: Achieves superior IoU and recall on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on challenging road regions.

Conclusion: D3FNet provides a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios, with ablation studies confirming the synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT is a backpropagation-free test-time adaptation method that models class-conditional distributions using Gaussian probabilistic inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance without source data or gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time adaptation methods suffer from scalability issues due to reliance on backpropagation/iterative optimization, and lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions which is crucial for reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions.

Method: Reframes TTA as Gaussian probabilistic inference by modeling class-conditional likelihoods with gradually updated class means and shared covariance matrix. Uses lightweight regularization with CLIP priors and historical knowledge bank to correct potential likelihood bias. Requires no source data, gradient updates, or full target data access.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks under various distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ADAPT provides an effective backpropagation-free solution for test-time adaptation that explicitly models class distributions, enabling reliable performance without the computational overhead of traditional optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage training strategy using neighbor-aware soft mask to address spectral bias in Implicit Neural Representations, improving high-frequency detail capture without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations struggle with spectral bias, favoring low-frequency components and missing high-frequency details like sharp edges and fine textures, which existing methods address through architectural modifications rather than training guidance.

Method: A two-stage training approach: first uses a neighbor-aware soft mask that adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations to focus on fine details early, then transitions to full-image training.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in reconstruction quality and the approach complements existing INR methods effectively.

Conclusion: This work pioneers frequency-aware pixel importance assignment in image INR, offering a new avenue for mitigating spectral bias through training guidance rather than architectural changes.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel linear time convex relaxation and contractor method for fast global optimal point cloud registration with high outlier robustness, achieving two orders of magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art SDP methods for rotation-only problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing provably globally optimal approaches for point cloud registration with TLS formulation using SDP relaxations are too slow (hundreds of seconds for 100 points), making them impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Proposed a linear time convex relaxation and contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound (BnB) optimization. The approach focuses on rotation-only problems when the axis of rotation is provided.

Result: The solver can register 3D point clouds with 100 points to provable global optimality in less than half a second, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE for rotation-only TLS problems.

Conclusion: The method provides both formal proof and empirical evidence of global optimality while achieving significant computational speed improvements, though it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem and is limited to rotation-only cases with known rotation axis.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Motivation: Understanding spatial distribution of wildlife and human activities is essential for evaluating human-wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning in protected landscapes.

Method: Used visible/NIR camera traps and thermal infrared drones to collect imagery, processed data to create training datasets, built deep learning models (YOLOv11s and enhanced Faster RCNN) for automatic identification, and performed spatial pattern analysis to identify hotspots and conflict zones.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT is a Video LLM that improves temporal perception through diffusion temporal encoding, object-grounded representations, and explicit timestamp modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal perception - they implicitly encode timestamps, have weak frame-level continuity features, and suffer from language-vision alignment drift with entities of interest.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Diffusion Temporal Latent encoder for boundary sensitivity and temporal consistency, 2) Object-grounded representations that bind query entities to visual evidence, 3) Mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens for explicit timestamp modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating robust grounding capabilities.

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT successfully overcomes limitations in temporal perception for Video LLMs through its three-component design, enabling fine-grained temporal reasoning and improved entity alignment in video understanding.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Weakly supervised approach for ALS tree instance segmentation using human quality ratings to train a rating model that improves segmentation performance by 34%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree instance segmentation from ALS data is challenging due to data variations and expensive precise labeling requirements for fully supervised methods

Method: Human operators provide quality ratings on initial segmentation results, which train a rating model that classifies segmentation outputs, then the segmentation model is finetuned using rating model feedback

Result: 34% improvement in correctly identified tree instances with significant reduction in non-tree instances predicted

Conclusion: Method effectively improves segmentation performance but struggles with small trees (<2m) in sparse forests and complex environments with shrubs/boulders that can be confused as trees

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: CFG is a transfer-based black-box attack method for 3D point clouds that improves adversarial transferability by prioritizing corruption of critical features shared across different DNN architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D adversarial attack methods require information about target models, which is unrealistic in secure scenarios. Transfer-based attacks are needed that work without any target model information.

Method: Proposes Critical Feature Guidance (CFG) that computes feature importance to prioritize corruption of critical features used by diverse architectures. Also constrains maximum deviation to ensure imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show CFG outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: CFG successfully enables effective transfer-based black-box attacks on 3D point clouds by leveraging consistent critical features across different DNN architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from multimodal teacher models to efficient vision-only student models for online HD map construction, achieving significant performance improvements while accelerating inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online HD map construction methods rely on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensors, creating computational overhead. The goal is to develop an efficient, low-cost vision-centric solution without sacrificing performance.

Method: Proposes MapKD with Teacher-Coach-Student paradigm: 1) Camera-LiDAR fusion teacher with map priors, 2) Vision-centric coach with simulated LiDAR to bridge modality gap, 3) Lightweight vision-based student. Uses Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation and Masked Semantic Response Distillation strategies.

Result: On nuScenes dataset, improves student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while accelerating inference speed compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The knowledge distillation framework successfully transfers multimodal knowledge to efficient vision-only models, enabling high-performance HD map construction without computational overhead of multi-modal sensors.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

*Franz Hanke,Antonia Bieringer,Olaf Wysocki,Boris Jutzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CM2LoD3 is a novel method for automated Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) building reconstruction using Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis and synthetic data generation to segment facade elements like windows and doors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoD1 and LoD2 building models lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban applications, while traditional LoD3 modeling requires manual effort that prevents large-scale adoption.

Method: Leverages Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis, uses synthetically generated Semantic Conflict Maps for segmentation, and fuses additional textured model segmentation with confidence scores to improve accuracy.

Result: Achieves 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures, effectively segmenting and reconstructing building openings for LoD3 models.

Conclusion: The method advances automated LoD3 reconstruction, enabling scalable and efficient 3D city modeling for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management applications.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDPR framework addresses class imbalance in VLM fine-tuning by creating multi-dimensional knowledge base and dynamic prompt routing to balance semantics and improve tail class performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fine-tuning methods suffer from bias in class-imbalanced scenes and overlook inherent class imbalance in pre-training, leading to bias accumulation in downstream tasks.

Method: Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) constructs comprehensive knowledge base across five visual-semantic dimensions, uses dynamic routing to align global classes, retrieve optimal prompts, and balance fine-grained semantics with logits fusion.

Result: Achieves comparable results with SOTA methods on long-tailed benchmarks (CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT), with minimal computational overhead and effective semantic library for tail classes.

Conclusion: MDPR provides flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance through multi-dimensional semantic knowledge and dynamic routing mechanism.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamMem is a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for efficient long video understanding in MLLMs, achieving SOTA performance with fixed-size memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long videos due to memory/computational overhead from KV cache storage, and current compression methods require full context encoding or advance question access.

Method: Encodes video frames in streaming manner, compresses KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, maintains fixed-size KV memory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three long video understanding and two streaming video QA benchmarks, competitive with query-aware approaches.

Conclusion: StreamMem enables efficient question answering in memory-constrained long-video scenarios without requiring prior question knowledge.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWeaver is a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions to enhance temporal consistency and reduce structural drift in extended video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models relying primarily on RGB signals suffer from accumulated errors in object structure and motion over long sequences, leading to temporal inconsistency and drift.

Method: The framework jointly predicts perceptual conditions and color information from unified representation, leverages depth cues for memory bank construction, and employs segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups to reduce drift and computational costs.

Result: Extensive experiments on diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate WorldWeaver's effectiveness in reducing temporal drift and improving video fidelity in long-horizon generation.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver provides a unified approach that significantly enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics in long video generation by combining RGB and perceptual condition modeling with depth-based memory preservation and efficient training techniques.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

TL;DR: All-in-SAM model combines molecular-empowered learning with SAM adapter to improve cell segmentation and classification in computational pathology, reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation of specific nuclei subtypes and cells in pathology images, requiring better adaptation for medical applications.

Method: Full-stack approach with: (1) molecular-empowered learning to reduce pixel-level annotations, (2) SAM adapter for semantic adaptation, and (3) Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL) for refinement.

Result: Significant improvement in cell classification performance on both in-house and public datasets, even with varying annotation quality.

Conclusion: Reduces annotator workload and extends precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, advancing medical diagnostics and pathology automation.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

TL;DR: Waver is a high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation that achieves top-3 rankings on T2V and I2V leaderboards, generating 5-10 second 720p videos upscaled to 1080p with superior motion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that can handle text-to-video, image-to-video, and text-to-image generation simultaneously while addressing the challenges of motion complexity, temporal consistency, and training efficiency in video generation models.

Method: Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for enhanced modality alignment and faster training convergence, comprehensive data curation pipeline with MLLM-based video quality filtering, and detailed training/inference recipes for high-quality video generation.

Result: Waver generates 5-10 second videos at 720p native resolution (upscaled to 1080p) with complex motion capture, superior motion amplitude, and temporal consistency. It ranks Top 3 on both T2V and I2V leaderboards, outperforming open-source models and matching/commercial SOTA solutions.

Conclusion: Waver demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in unified image and video generation, providing the community with efficient training methods and accelerating progress in video generation technologies through its open technical report and recipes.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

TL;DR: ATLAS is a high-fidelity parametric body model that decouples shape and skeleton representation, enabling more accurate 3D human modeling with enhanced expressivity and control over body attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mesh models struggle with detailed variations across diverse poses and shapes due to limited training data diversity and problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and external soft tissue.

Method: Learned from 600k high-resolution scans using 240 synchronized cameras, ATLAS explicitly decouples shape and skeleton bases by grounding mesh representation in the human skeleton, using non-linear pose correctives.

Result: ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, with quantitative evaluations showing non-linear pose correctives capture complex poses better than linear models.

Conclusion: The skeleton-shape decoupling approach enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent of soft-tissue characteristics, representing a significant advancement in parametric body modeling.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Motivation: Address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: Uses a novel feature aggregation module integrating local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders, coupled with a position head to generate 3D assets and their spatial positions in a single feedforward pass.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities, with direct extensibility to multi-image inputs despite single-image training.

Conclusion: SceneGen offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation that can advance practical applications in downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit is a visual autoregressive framework that reframes image editing as next-scale prediction, addressing diffusion models' adherence issues with a Scale-Aligned Reference module for precise text-guided editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image editing suffer from unintended spurious modifications due to global denoising that entangles edited regions with entire image context, compromising adherence to editing instructions.

Method: VAREdit uses a visual autoregressive framework that formulates image editing as sequential next-scale prediction. It introduces a Scale-Aligned Reference module to inject scale-matched conditioning information from source image features into the first self-attention layer.

Result: Outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30%+ higher GPT-Balance score, completes 512×512 editing in 1.2 seconds (2.2× faster than similarly sized UltraEdit).

Conclusion: Autoregressive models offer superior adherence and efficiency for instruction-guided image editing compared to diffusion-based approaches, with VAREdit demonstrating significant advancements in both metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable group inference method that improves diversity and quality of multiple samples by formulating selection as a quadratic integer assignment problem with progressive candidate pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent sampling in generative models leads to redundant results when presenting multiple outputs to users, limiting choices and hindering idea exploration in real-world applications.

Method: Formulates group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem where candidate outputs are graph nodes, optimizing sample quality (unary term) and group diversity (binary term) with progressive candidate pruning for efficiency.

Result: Significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms across text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Enables generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples, providing better user experience for idea exploration and choice selection.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale is a novel inference paradigm that enables high-resolution visual generation (up to 8K images and 4K videos) without fine-tuning, addressing repetitive pattern issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual diffusion models are typically trained at limited resolutions due to data and computational constraints, leading to poor quality and repetitive patterns when generating higher-resolution content than trained for.

Method: Proposes CineScale, an inference paradigm with dedicated variants for different video generation architectures, built on state-of-the-art open-source frameworks to enable high-resolution T2I, T2V, I2V and V2V synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models, enabling 8K image generation without fine-tuning and 4K video generation with minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CineScale successfully extends the capabilities of pre-trained models for high-resolution visual generation, overcoming the limitations of existing tuning-free methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:
