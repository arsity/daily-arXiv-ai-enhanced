Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by\nrehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic\nmemory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store\ntemporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and\nthereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between\nmemory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory\nintegrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL\nconsists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic\nmemory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We\nintroduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory\nand semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of\ntemporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously\nvalidate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and\nSomething-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and\nKinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark.

Existing\ncross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage\ntraining, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model\nthrough a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components\nand multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which\nleverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.\nWhile PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it\nencounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and\ncontextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an\nextension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and\ndatasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified\nframework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.\nAdditionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to\nenhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with\ndual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.\nExtensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms\nof generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified\ncross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.\nThe source codes and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/BradleyWang0416/Human-in-Context.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a unified cross-domain model, HiC, for 3D human motion, improving generalization, scalability, and performance over its predecessor PiC.", "motivation": "Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, limiting practicality and scalability.", "method": "HiC extends PiC by combining pose and mesh representations, expanding task coverage, using max-min similarity prompt sampling, and dual-branch context injection.", "result": "HiC outperforms PiC in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains.", "conclusion": "HiC demonstrates potential for a flexible, scalable unified cross-domain 3D human motion model."}}
