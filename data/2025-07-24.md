*Yi-Shan Chu,Hsuan-Cheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision Transformer-based framework that uses weakly supervised learning to improve disaster-affected area segmentation from satellite imagery, starting with minimal manual annotations and expanding them using PCA-based confidence indexing to train models on Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance disaster-affected area segmentation for emergency response applications when accurate ground truth data is limited or unavailable, specifically supporting Taiwan Space Agency's Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) system for better disaster mapping capabilities.

Method: The framework uses Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture with multi-band satellite inputs. It starts with minimal manual annotations, applies PCA-based feature analysis to construct a confidence index for label expansion, creates weakly supervised training sets, and employs multiple decoder variants with multi-stage loss strategies for improved performance under limited supervision.

Result: Case studies on 2022 Poyang Lake drought and 2023 Rhodes wildfire showed improved smoothness and reliability of segmentation results. The framework demonstrated better spatial coherence and segmentation consistency when compared with higher-resolution EVAP outputs, providing a scalable solution for disaster mapping.

Conclusion: The proposed ViT-based framework successfully refines disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery through weakly supervised learning, offering a practical and scalable approach for disaster mapping applications when ground truth data is scarce, with demonstrated improvements in segmentation quality and spatial consistency.

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

### [2] [Toward a Real-Time Framework for Accurate Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16850)
*Mohamed Adjel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time monocular 3D human pose estimation framework that combines 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, using camera intrinsics and anatomical priors to achieve fast, personalized pose estimation without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenging and ill-posed, especially in real-time and unconstrained environments. Direct image-to-3D approaches require large datasets and heavy models, while existing methods lack the flexibility and efficiency needed for edge device deployment.

Method: The framework combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting that explicitly leverages known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. It uses self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets.

Result: The approach enables fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware, offering a lightweight and flexible alternative to direct image-to-3D methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

### [3] [Coarse-to-fine crack cue for robust crack detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16851)
*Zelong Liu,Yuliang Gu,Zhichao Sun,Huachao Zhu,Xin Xiao,Bo Du,Laurent Najman,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue is a novel coarse-to-fine method that leverages the thin structure property of cracks to generate robust crack cues, significantly improving generalization ability of existing crack detection networks across different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based crack detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen domains, and the thin structure property of cracks is usually overlooked by previous methods, leading to poor performance in complex backgrounds with shadows and varied lighting conditions.

Method: A coarse-to-fine crack cue generation approach that: (1) applies max-pooling and upsampling on crack images to create coarse crack-free backgrounds, (2) uses a reconstruction network to obtain fine crack-free backgrounds, and (3) generates fine crack cues by computing the difference between original images and reconstructed crack-free backgrounds.

Result: The proposed CrackCue method significantly improves generalization ability and robustness when integrated into three advanced crack detection networks, demonstrating effectiveness as a plug-and-play solution across different baseline methods.

Conclusion: CrackCue successfully addresses the domain generalization problem in crack detection by exploiting the thin structure property of cracks to generate robust prior information that is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadows, and lighting variations.

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

### [4] [CLAMP: Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Fusion for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16854)
*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLAMP, a contrastive learning framework for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis that uses progressive attention fusion, multi-task contrastive learning, and adaptive multi-loss aggregation to better align text and image features for identifying aspect terms and their sentiment polarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MABSA methods suffer from cross-modal alignment noise and insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. Global modality alignment methods often overlook connections between aspect terms and corresponding local visual regions, creating a representation gap between text and images that needs to be addressed.

Method: The paper introduces CLAMP, an end-to-end framework with three key modules: (1) Progressive Attention Fusion network for hierarchical multi-stage cross-modal interactions to enhance fine-grained text-image alignment while suppressing visual noise, (2) Multi-task Contrastive Learning combining global modal contrast and local granularity alignment for better cross-modal representation consistency, and (3) Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation using dynamic uncertainty-based weighting to calibrate loss contributions and mitigate gradient interference.

Result: CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art methods on standard public benchmarks for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAMP framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing MABSA methods by improving cross-modal alignment and representation consistency through its three novel modules, demonstrating superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

### [5] [SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856)
*Youngjin Na,Sangheon Jeong,Youngwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that detects and mitigates harmful intent in vision-language models by using a three-stage reasoning process to understand the combined meaning of image-text inputs and provide safer responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face new safety risks where seemingly innocent images and text can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe responses. Existing safety approaches using post hoc filtering or static refusal prompts fail to detect these latent risks that emerge from the combination of multimodal inputs.

Method: SIA uses a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning to understand images, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to detect harmful intent, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement to generate safer outputs. The framework is training-free and dynamically adapts to implicit intent inferred from image-text pairs rather than using predefined rules.

Result: SIA achieves substantial safety improvements on safety-critical benchmarks (SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe), outperforming prior methods. There is a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, but the safety gains demonstrate the effectiveness of intent-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: SIA successfully addresses multimodal safety risks by proactively detecting harmful intent through intent-aware reasoning. The framework shows that understanding the combined meaning of image-text inputs is crucial for aligning vision-language models with human-centric values, despite some trade-offs in general reasoning performance.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

### [6] [Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16861)
*Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve 3D perception in autonomous vehicles by addressing misalignment issues between LiDAR and camera features in Bird's-Eye-View representation through three key components: Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF), and Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-camera fusion methods suffer from misalignment between modalities due to projection errors caused by extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and LiDAR rolling shutter effects. These misalignments are concentrated at object-background boundaries and can be identified by 2D detectors, motivating the use of 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion.

Method: The method consists of three components: (1) Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC) that uses 2D priors to correct local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs, (2) Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) that processes calibrated results to suppress noise and enhance object-background boundaries, and (3) Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM) that uses gated attention to efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes validation dataset with mAP of 71.5% and NDS of 73.6%, demonstrating significant improvement in 3D perception capabilities for autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: By identifying that projection errors concentrate at object-background boundaries and leveraging 2D object priors for feature alignment, the proposed three-component approach successfully addresses both local and global misalignment issues in LiDAR-camera fusion, leading to enhanced 3D perception performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

### [7] [Pixels, Patterns, but No Poetry: To See The World like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16863)
*Hongcheng Gao,Zihao Huang,Lin Xu,Jingyi Tang,Xinhao Li,Yue Liu,Haoyang Li,Taihang Hu,Minhua Lin,Xinlong Yang,Ge Wu,Balong Bi,Hongyu Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET), a perception-focused benchmark that reveals catastrophic failures in state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual tasks that are trivial for humans, highlighting a critical gap in vision tower generalization rather than language reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent research has focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can MLLMs truly perceive the world as humans do? The authors shift focus from reasoning to perception to address this gap and evaluate whether MLLMs can achieve human-like visual understanding.

Method: The researchers introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. They test various approaches including in-context learning, training on language backbone, and fine-tuning the vision tower to identify where the performance bottlenecks occur.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on perceptual tasks that are trivial for humans. In-context learning and training on language backbone (effective for previous benchmarks) fail to improve performance on these tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, indicating the problem lies in vision tower generalization rather than language reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study reveals a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception, specifically in vision tower generalization rather than knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone. This suggests that improving visual perception in MLLMs requires focusing on enhancing the vision components rather than just the language reasoning parts.

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

### [8] [HIPPO-Video: Simulating Watch Histories with Large Language Models for Personalized Video Highlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16873)
*Jeongeun Lee,Youngjae Yu,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for personalized video highlighting that uses LLM-based user simulators to generate realistic watch histories, and proposes HiPHer method to predict user-specific video saliency scores, outperforming existing generic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack personalization and rely on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the complexity of user behavior and preferences in video highlighting tasks, while the exponential growth of video content makes personalized highlighting essential.

Method: The authors create HIPPO-Video dataset using an LLM-based user simulator to generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences, and propose HiPHer method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores.

Result: The dataset contains 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs covering 20,400 videos across 170 semantic categories. Extensive experiments show that HiPHer outperforms existing generic and query-based approaches for video highlighting.

Conclusion: The proposed HIPPO-Video dataset and HiPHer method demonstrate significant potential for highly user-centric video highlighting in real-world scenarios, effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches that lack personalization.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

### [9] [ReMeREC: Relation-aware and Multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16877)
*Yizhi Hu,Zezhao Tian,Xingqun Qi,Chen Su,Bingkun Yang,Junhui Yin,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReMeREC, a framework for multi-entity referring expression comprehension that models inter-entity relationships, along with a new dataset ReMeX containing detailed relationship annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring expression comprehension methods focus on single-entity localization and ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, which limits their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, there's a lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations.

Method: The authors propose ReMeREC framework with two key components: (1) Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) that dynamically infers entity quantity and span from textual cues, and (2) Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) that enhances relational reasoning. They also construct ReMeX dataset with detailed relationship annotations and EntityText auxiliary dataset using large language models.

Result: ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing approaches in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ReMeREC framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing REC methods by modeling inter-entity relationships and handling semantic ambiguity, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks for multi-entity referring expression comprehension.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

### [10] [CausalStep: A Benchmark for Explicit Stepwise Causal Reasoning in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16878)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalStep is a new benchmark that evaluates large language models' ability to perform stepwise causal reasoning in videos through 100 videos with 1,852 QA pairs, revealing significant gaps between current models and human-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning, mainly assessing shallow understanding and allowing models to exploit global context rather than requiring sequential reasoning steps.

Method: The benchmark segments videos into causally linked units with strict stepwise QA protocol requiring sequential answers, includes carefully constructed distractors based on error taxonomy, and introduces seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation across 100 videos in six categories.

Result: Experiments with leading proprietary and open-source models, along with human baselines, reveal a significant performance gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning capabilities in video understanding.

Conclusion: CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark that addresses limitations in current video reasoning evaluation and can drive progress toward more robust and interpretable video reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

### [11] [Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Less Local Than Assumed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880)
*Antoni Kowalczuk,Dominik Hintersdorf,Lukas Struppek,Kristian Kersting,Adam Dziedzic,Franziska Boenisch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes the fragility of existing weight-pruning defenses against memorization in text-to-image diffusion models and proposes a novel adversarial fine-tuning method to build more robust defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models can inadvertently memorize and replicate training data, raising data privacy and intellectual property concerns. Current mitigation approaches that prune weights responsible for replication may not be robust enough, necessitating a deeper understanding of memorization mechanisms.

Method: The authors assess the robustness of pruning-based defenses by demonstrating how minor text embedding adjustments can re-trigger replication. They challenge the assumption of memorization locality by showing replication can be triggered from diverse locations. They introduce an adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness.

Result: The research shows that existing pruning-based defenses are fragile - minor prompt adjustments can bypass them. Memorization is not localized but can be triggered from multiple locations in the text embedding space through different model pathways. The proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach provides a foundation for more robust defenses.

Conclusion: Current mitigation strategies are insufficient as they only suppress retrieval rather than truly removing memorized content. The paper provides new insights into memorization nature in text-to-image diffusion models and establishes groundwork for developing more trustworthy and compliant generative AI systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

*Yaoyu Fang,Jiahe Qian,Xinkun Wang,Lee A. Cooper,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2S-ST is a novel framework that accurately reconstructs high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data from sparse, low-cost inputs by using self-supervised learning and natural image co-training, making spatial transcriptomics more accessible for biomedical research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is expensive and scarce, creating significant barriers for widespread adoption in biomedical research despite its revolutionary potential for tissue-level gene expression profiling.

Method: The framework combines three innovations: (1) sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning that exploits spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to improve feature representation, and (3) Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) for iterative prediction refinement while maintaining data fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tissue types (breast cancer, liver, lymphoid tissue) show superior imputation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, successfully reconstructing high-resolution ST data from sparse inputs.

Conclusion: S2S-ST significantly reduces dependence on costly high-resolution ST data by enabling robust reconstruction from sparse inputs, potentially facilitating broader adoption of spatial transcriptomics in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: AURA is the first visual linguistic explainability agent for medical imaging that uses LLM-based architecture (Qwen-32B) to provide interactive analysis, explanations, and evaluation of medical images through dynamic interactions and hypothesis testing.


<details>

Conclusion: AURA demonstrates the promise of agentic AI in transforming medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support systems, providing comprehensive analysis, explanation, and evaluation capabilities specifically designed for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular

segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.

### [14] [Toward Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection through Class-Agnostic Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16946)
*Chiao-An Yang,Kuan-Chuan Peng,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection (LTOAD), a realistic anomaly detection setting that combines long-tailed data distribution with online learning. The authors propose a class-agnostic framework that outperforms existing methods without requiring class labels or knowing the number of classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to realistic scenarios where training data follows long-tailed distributions and learning must occur online. Current Long-Tailed Anomaly Detection (LTAD) methods are class-aware and require class labels, making them unsuitable for online settings where such information is unavailable.

Method: The authors develop a class-agnostic framework for long-tailed anomaly detection that can be adapted to online learning settings. This approach eliminates the need for class labels and prior knowledge of the number of classes, making it suitable for real-world online scenarios.

Result: The method achieves superior performance across multiple settings: +4.63% image-AUROC improvement on MVTec dataset compared to methods with access to class labels and class counts in offline LTAD settings. In the challenging long-tailed online setting, it achieves +0.53% image-AUROC improvement over baselines. The method demonstrates effectiveness in both industrial manufacturing and medical domains.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap between theoretical anomaly detection research and practical applications by introducing LTOAD and proposing an effective class-agnostic solution. The method's superior performance across different domains and settings, combined with the release of a benchmark dataset, contributes significantly to advancing realistic anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

### [15] [Divisive Decisions: Improving Salience-Based Training for Generalization in Binary Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17000)
*Jacob Piland,Chris Sweet,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to improve model generalization, showing better performance than traditional approaches that only use true-class CAMs across multiple binary classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency-guided training methods only consider the model's class activation map for the correct label (true-class CAM) while ignoring the activation maps for incorrect labels (false-class CAMs). The authors hypothesize that in binary tasks, true and false CAMs should diverge on important classification features identified by humans, which could be leveraged to improve training.

Method: The paper introduces three new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class CAMs into the training strategy, along with a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. These methods compare model CAMs against human reference saliency maps during training.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional saliency-guided training approaches across several diverse binary classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric presentation attack detection, and chest X-ray anomaly classification in both close-set and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating both true-class and false-class CAMs in saliency-guided training leads to better model generalization than methods that only use true-class CAMs. The approach is validated across multiple binary classification domains and the authors provide source codes and model weights for reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

### [16] [Bringing Balance to Hand Shape Classification: Mitigating Data Imbalance Through Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17008)
*Gaston Gustavo Rios,Pedro Dal Bianco,Franco Ronchetti,Facundo Quiroga,Oscar Stanchi,Santiago Ponte Ahón,Waldo Hasperué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of limited and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets by using synthetic data generation with two GAN architectures (ReACGAN and SPADE) to augment training data, achieving 5% improvement in accuracy on the RWTH German sign language dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced, creating significant challenges for effective model training. The scarcity and imbalance of real data hinders the development of robust handshape classifiers for sign language recognition systems.

Method: The authors use an EfficientNet classifier trained on the RWTH German sign language dataset and employ two GAN architectures for synthetic data generation: (1) ReACGAN - uses label information to condition data generation through an auxiliary classifier, and (2) SPADE - utilizes spatially-adaptive normalization to condition generation on pose information. Different strategies are applied to combine generated and real images for training.

Result: The proposed techniques improve state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%. The method demonstrates generalization capability across different sign language datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID dataset, achieving comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers without requiring generator retraining.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using GANs effectively addresses the limitations of small and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets. The combination of ReACGAN and SPADE architectures provides complementary benefits - realistic label-aligned images and spatially accurate handshape configurations - leading to significant performance improvements and cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

*Muhammad Kamran,Mohammad Moein Sheikholeslami,Andreas Wichmann,Gunho Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Decoupled-PolyGCN, a deep learning method using Graph Convolutional Networks to automatically extract building footprints from satellite imagery, achieving 6% improvement in AP and 10% in AR over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of satellites generates vast amounts of high-resolution imagery for mapping applications, but reconstructing spatial maps from satellite data remains challenging due to the complexity of creating accurate primitive-based object representations. Current methods rely on labor-intensive manual processes, creating a need for automated, scalable solutions for building footprint extraction.

Method: The paper proposes Decoupled-PolyGCN, a novel deep learning methodology that leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and incorporates three key innovations: geometric regularity integration into building boundaries, multi-scale and multi-resolution feature integration, and embedding of Attraction Field Maps into the network architecture.

Result: The proposed Decoupled-PolyGCN model outperforms existing methods with a 6% improvement in Average Precision (AP) and 10% improvement in Average Recall (AR), demonstrating superior performance in delivering accurate and regularized building footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of automated building footprint extraction from single satellite images by providing a scalable and precise solution. The method shows significant performance improvements and opens opportunities for impactful applications in urban planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

### [18] [Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047)
*Kuleen Sasse,Efsun Sarioglu Kayi,Arun Reddy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a video understanding system that converts long-form videos into text-based summaries using progressive captioning, then leverages LLMs to answer complex queries about video content by enriching captions with both action and scene descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos are extremely dense and high-dimensional, making them computationally challenging to process directly. Text-based summaries provide a more compact representation that can be easily processed by LLMs for complex reasoning and question-answering tasks.

Method: The system uses LaViLa video captioner to progressively build text-based memory from video chunks, incorporates static scene descriptions using LLaVA VLM to enrich captions beyond just human actions, explores video partitioning strategies for better content structure representation, and fine-tunes a controllable hybrid captioner that can produce both action and scene captions based on input tokens.

Result: The enhanced captioning pipeline produces more detailed and complete caption logs that expand the range of answerable questions. The fine-tuned controllable hybrid captioner significantly improves efficiency compared to using separate models for action and scene captioning, and can alternate between caption types based on detected scene changes.

Conclusion: The proposed video understanding system successfully addresses the challenge of processing long-form videos by creating enriched text-based representations that enable LLMs to perform complex reasoning and answer diverse questions about video content more effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNarrator is a training-free pipeline that generates dense video captions with precise timestamps by combining multiple MLLMs and VLMs to reduce hallucinations and improve temporal alignment in video narration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with temporally aligned video narrations and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios, creating a need for better video captioning solutions.

Method: A flexible training-free pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models functioning as caption generators, context providers, or caption verifiers in a synergistic interaction framework.

Result: The synergistic interaction of multiple components significantly enhances video narration quality and accuracy, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving temporal alignment compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VideoNarrator successfully addresses temporal alignment and hallucination issues in video captioning, enhancing video understanding and facilitating downstream tasks like video summarization, question answering, and potential advertising applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey examines few-shot learning (FSL) advances for video and 3D object detection, showing how FSL can reduce expensive manual annotation by enabling models to recognize novel classes from just a few examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data labeling for object detection is expensive and laborious, especially for video (annotating across frames) and 3D data (costly 3D annotations). FSL can significantly reduce annotation requirements while maintaining detection performance.

Method: The paper surveys FSL techniques across two domains: (1) Video detection using tube proposals and temporal matching networks that leverage spatiotemporal structure, and (2) 3D detection integrating FSL with specialized point cloud networks and class imbalance-tailored losses for LiDAR/depth data.

Result: FSL techniques successfully enable detection of novel classes from minimal examples by leveraging domain-specific properties: temporal information in videos and specialized architectures for sparse 3D point clouds, making practical deployment feasible for autonomous driving and video applications.

Conclusion: FSL shows significant promise for reducing annotation requirements in real-world applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal, and data modalities, though challenges remain in balancing generalization vs overfitting and handling diverse data modality properties.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

*Zaipeng Duan,Chenxu Dang,Xuzhong Hu,Pei An,Junfeng Ding,Jie Zhan,Yunbiao Xu,Jie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDG-OCC, a multimodal 3D occupancy prediction network that combines camera and LiDAR data through semantic and depth-guided view transformation with fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation, achieving state-of-the-art real-time performance on autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods are limited by single-modality approaches: camera-based methods lack depth information while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods using Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and fail to fully exploit geometric and semantic information from 3D LiDAR points.

Method: The paper introduces SDG-OCC with two key components: (1) Joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation that constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization, and (2) Fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation that extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Two variants are proposed: SDG-Fusion (fusion only) and SDG-KL (fusion + distillation for faster inference).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across different datasets.

Conclusion: SDG-OCC successfully addresses the limitations of single-modality approaches by effectively combining camera and LiDAR data through enhanced view transformation and active distillation, achieving superior performance in multimodal 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedVLM is a federated learning framework that uses personalized LoRA (pLoRA) to fine-tune vision-language models in decentralized environments, achieving 24.5% performance improvement over standard LoRA on heterogeneous client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision-language models at scale in federated environments is challenging due to decentralized, non-iid data distribution across clients. Existing parameter-efficient methods like LoRA struggle with heterogeneous client data, leading to suboptimal generalization and requiring a solution that preserves privacy while enabling effective adaptation.

Method: The paper proposes FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework with personalized LoRA (pLoRA) that dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each client's unique data distribution. This enables decentralized VLM adaptation while maintaining model privacy and reducing dependence on centralized training.

Result: Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset demonstrate that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% compared to standard LoRA, showing superior adaptation capabilities in non-iid federated settings while maintaining global model aggregation.

Conclusion: FedVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning vision-language models in federated environments, successfully addressing data heterogeneity challenges and advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios through the novel pLoRA approach.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each

while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard

*Shanshan Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Qi Zhang,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IONext, a CNN-based inertial odometry backbone that uses Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) and Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) to capture both global and local motion features, outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer and CNN methods on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Transformer-based models excel at long-range dependencies in inertial odometry, they have limited sensitivity to local motion variations and lack inherent inductive biases, hindering localization accuracy. Existing CNN approaches also have limitations in temporal modeling. The authors aim to combine the benefits of both architectures.

Method: The authors propose IONext with two key components: (1) Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) that adaptively captures global and local motion features through dynamic weight generation and multi-scale feature aggregation, and (2) Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) that selectively extracts representative motion features in the temporal domain to improve temporal modeling.

Result: IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer and CNN-based methods across six public datasets. On the RNIN dataset specifically, IONext reduces average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 10% and average Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 12% compared to the representative iMOT model.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based IONext architecture successfully addresses the limitations of both Transformer and existing CNN approaches for inertial odometry by effectively combining global motion perception with local feature sensitivity and improved temporal modeling, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.

### [25] [ScSAM: Debiasing Morphology and Distributional Variability in Subcellular Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17149)
*Bo Fang,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Hang Chang,Gerald J. Shami,Filip Braet,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScSAM is a method that enhances subcellular organelle segmentation by combining pre-trained SAM with MAE-guided cellular prior knowledge to address morphological variability and training bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse subcellular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subcellular organelle segmentation faces challenges due to significant morphological and distributional variability among components, leading to biased feature learning. Existing methods rely on single mapping relationships and overlook feature diversity. While SAM provides rich features, it struggles with subcellular scenarios due to label space gaps and focus on global context rather than fine-grained spatial details.

Method: The paper introduces ScSAM, which fuses pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge. Key components include: (1) a feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same feature space and combine different representations, and (2) a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate class-specific features for subcellular category recognition.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in organelle segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: ScSAM successfully addresses the challenges of subcellular organelle segmentation by enhancing feature robustness through the fusion of SAM and MAE-guided prior knowledge, effectively alleviating training bias from data imbalance and achieving superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [26] [UNICE: Training A Universal Image Contrast Enhancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17157)
*Ruodai Cui,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNICE is a universal image contrast enhancement method that generates multi-exposure sequences from single images and fuses them for enhancement, achieving superior generalization across different contrast enhancement tasks without requiring costly human labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are task-specific and show poor generalization across different tasks and datasets. There is a need for a universal model that can handle various contrast enhancement tasks, as they all fundamentally require exposure and contrast adjustment.

Method: The authors collect 46,928 HDR raw images and render 328,496 sRGB images to create multi-exposure sequences (MES) with pseudo ground-truths via multi-exposure fusion. They train two networks: one to generate MES from a single sRGB image, and another to fuse the generated MES into an enhanced image.

Result: UNICE demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing methods across different contrast enhancement tasks and datasets. It even outperforms manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image quality metrics, while being free of costly human labeling.

Conclusion: The proposed UNICE method successfully addresses the generalization problem in image contrast enhancement by leveraging multi-exposure sequences and fusion techniques, providing a universal solution that works well across various contrast enhancement scenarios without requiring expensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

### [27] [DOOMGAN:High-Fidelity Dynamic Identity Obfuscation Ocular Generative Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17158)
*Bharath Krishnamurthy,Ajita Rattani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DOOMGAN, a novel GAN-based method for generating morphing attacks on visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, achieving significantly higher attack success rates while preserving detailed anatomical features and releasing the first comprehensive ocular morphing dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While morphing attacks have been extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face biometrics, visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored despite being vulnerable to such attacks. Existing methods struggle to handle uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris boundaries and periocular textures, creating a security gap in biometric systems.

Method: DOOMGAN employs three key components: (1) landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy to capture structural details, (2) attention-guided generation mechanisms for realistic morph synthesis, and (3) dynamic weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized training convergence.

Result: DOOMGAN achieves over 20% higher attack success rates compared to baseline methods under stringent thresholds, demonstrates 20% better elliptical iris structure generation, and shows 30% improved gaze consistency. The authors also created and released the first comprehensive ocular morphing dataset.

Conclusion: DOOMGAN successfully addresses the gap in visible-spectrum ocular morphing attacks by providing a robust generation model that significantly outperforms existing methods in attack effectiveness while maintaining anatomical realism, contributing both a novel methodology and valuable dataset to advance research in biometric security.

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.

### [28] [Multi-Scale PCB Defect Detection with YOLOv8 Network Improved via Pruning and Lightweight Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17176)
*Li Pingzhen,Xu Sheng,Chen Jing,Su Chengyue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved YOLOv8-based multi-scale PCB defect detection method that achieves high accuracy (99.32% mAP0.5) and real-time performance through network lightweighting, adaptive pruning, and specialized components for tiny target detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCB defect detection models struggle to balance accuracy and computational cost for high-density PCB designs and high-speed production, failing to meet requirements for high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects in modern manufacturing environments.

Method: The method improves YOLOv8 through: (1) Ghost-HGNetv2 backbone for lightweight feature extraction, (2) C2f-Faster neck for enhanced multi-level feature fusion, (3) GCDetect head using GroupConv weight sharing for efficient regression/classification, (4) Inner-MPDIoU loss function for better tiny target detection, and (5) adaptive pruning to reduce model complexity.

Result: On publicly available PCB defect datasets, the model achieves mAP0.5 of 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 of 75.18%, representing a 10.13% improvement over YOLOv8n while maintaining real-time detection capabilities and reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale PCB defect detection method successfully balances accuracy and speed through comprehensive optimization strategies, making it suitable for high-density PCB manufacturing with requirements for both high precision and real-time performance in detecting tiny defects.

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.

### [29] [Hierarchical Fusion and Joint Aggregation: A Multi-Level Feature Representation Method for AIGC Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17182)
*Linghe Meng,Jiarun Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-level visual representation paradigm for AI-generated content quality assessment, developing two networks (MGLF-Net and MPEF-Net) that combine CNN and Transformer features at multiple levels to better evaluate both perceptual quality and text-to-image correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated content quality assessment methods rely on single-level visual features, which limits their ability to capture complex distortions spanning from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic understanding in AIGC images.

Method: A multi-level visual representation paradigm with three stages: (1) multi-level feature extraction, (2) hierarchical fusion, and (3) joint aggregation. Two networks are developed: MGLF-Net using dual CNN and Transformer backbones for perceptual quality assessment, and MPEF-Net embedding prompt semantics into visual feature fusion for text-to-image correspondence evaluation.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate outstanding performance on both perceptual quality assessment and text-to-image correspondence evaluation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The multi-level visual assessment paradigm effectively addresses the limitations of single-level feature approaches by capturing complex distortions across multiple visual representation levels, leading to improved AI-generated content quality assessment performance.

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.

### [30] [Asymmetric Lesion Detection with Geometric Patterns and CNN-SVM Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17185)
*M. A. Rasel,Sameem Abdul Kareem,Zhenli Kwan,Nik Aimee Azizah Faheem,Winn Hui Han,Rebecca Kai Jan Choong,Shin Shen Yong,Unaizah Obaidellah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a dual approach for analyzing skin lesion symmetry in dermoscopic images: a geometry-based algorithm for asymmetric lesion detection (99% accuracy) and a CNN-SVM hybrid classifier for three-class lesion shape classification (94% Kappa score), both aimed at assisting melanoma diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asymmetric lesion shape is a critical clinical criterion for melanoma diagnosis in dermoscopic images. The paper addresses the need to help non-experts understand and apply asymmetry criteria for skin lesion analysis, particularly since lesion shape provides vital insights into skin diseases that are not visible to the naked eye.

Method: The authors propose a two-pronged approach: (1) A supervised learning image processing algorithm for geometrical pattern analysis of lesion shapes to aid non-experts, and (2) A hybrid system using pre-trained CNN for feature extraction (shape, color, texture) combined with multiclass SVM classification. They first labeled a non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical assessments.

Result: The geometry-based experiment achieved 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. The CNN-based approach achieved 94% Kappa Score, 95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes into three categories: Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric. Both methods outperformed existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed effective methods for automated lesion symmetry analysis in dermoscopic images. The dual approach provides both high-accuracy asymmetric lesion detection and robust multi-class shape classification, offering valuable tools to assist in melanoma diagnosis and help non-experts understand asymmetry criteria in clinical practice.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

### [31] [Vec2Face+ for Face Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17192)
*Haiyu Wu,Jaskirat Singh,Sicong Tian,Liang Zheng,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vec2Face+ is a generative model that creates synthetic face datasets for training face recognition models, achieving state-of-the-art performance by maintaining both inter-class separability and intra-class identity consistency while generating diverse attributes and poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face synthesis methods for training data generation focus on large inter-class separability and intra-class attribute variation but overlook the necessity of maintaining intra-class identity consistency, which is crucial for generating high-quality face training datasets.

Method: The authors propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that creates images directly from image features with three key strategies: 1) sampling sufficiently different vectors to generate well-separated identities, 2) an AttrOP algorithm for increasing general attribute variations, and 3) LoRA-based pose control for generating profile head poses while preserving identity.

Result: Vec2Face+ generates VFace10K (10K identities) achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaled versions VFace100K and VFace300K (4M and 12M images) outperform the real-world CASIA-WebFace dataset on five test sets, marking the first time a synthetic dataset beats CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that synthetic face datasets can outperform real-world datasets when proper identity consistency is maintained alongside diversity. However, the authors identify important limitations: only 1 out of 11 synthetic datasets performs better than random guessing in twin verification, and models trained on synthetic data show more bias than those trained on real data.

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

*Jooyeol Yun,Heng Wang,Yotaro Shimose,Jaegul Choo,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesignLab is an automated slide design system that uses two specialized AI roles - a design reviewer and design contributor - to iteratively improve presentation slides through multiple rounds of issue detection and correction, outperforming existing design tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing high-quality presentation slides is challenging for non-experts due to complex design choices, and existing automated tools lack the ability to refine their own output, which is crucial in real-world design workflows.

Method: The system separates the design process into two roles: a design reviewer that identifies design-related issues and a design contributor that corrects them. Both roles are implemented using fine-tuned large language models, with training data generated by introducing controlled perturbations to simulate intermediate drafts and design errors.

Result: DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including commercial tools, by enabling iterative refinement that produces polished, professional slides with qualities that were previously unattainable.

Conclusion: The iterative design approach using specialized AI roles successfully addresses limitations of existing automated design tools, demonstrating that embracing the iterative nature of design leads to superior slide quality compared to single-pass generation methods.

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Method: A voxel-based framework consisting of: (1) initial coarse dental crown generation from voxelized intraoral scans, (2) fine-grained refiner with distance-aware supervision, (3) Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) during training to enhance margin line alignment, and (4) positional prompt based on FDI tooth numbering system for improved accuracy.

Result: The proposed VBCD framework outperforms existing methods on a large-scale dataset of intraoral scans, demonstrating superior performance in automated dental crown design tasks.

Conclusion: The VBCD framework provides a robust solution for personalized dental crown design, successfully addressing the labor-intensive nature of manual crown design through automated voxel-based processing with enhanced accuracy and quality.

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a cost-effective machine learning solution using YOLOv5 to automatically estimate timber log diameter from standard RGB images, achieving 0.64 mAP@0.5 for practical deployment in wood processing facilities without requiring expensive sensors or controlled environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wood processing identification methods rely on expert human labor which is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone when processing large volumes. The industry needs accurate and efficient automated solutions for species and thickness identification that can work under real-world conditions without expensive equipment.

Method: The researchers employed YOLOv5 object detection algorithm fine-tuned on the TimberSeg 1.0 public dataset to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness through bounding-box dimensions. The model was trained on standard RGB images captured in typical industrial sheds during timber delivery under real-world working conditions.

Result: The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating reliable log detection performance even with modest computing resources. The solution proved to be lightweight and scalable for practical applications.

Conclusion: This lightweight, scalable solution shows promise for practical integration into existing wood processing workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting, particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized operations seeking cost-effective automation without expensive sensors or controlled environments.

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIG-Nav introduces a pretrained vision-based navigation model that uses early-fusion ViT architecture and auxiliary tasks, achieving 22.6% improvement in zero-shot and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings over existing models while requiring less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretrained models for vision-based robotic navigation lack optimal design choices and training strategies, limiting their generalization ability and zero-shot performance in unseen environments. There's a need for better pretraining approaches that can achieve positive transfer across diverse environments.

Method: The approach consists of two main components: (1) Model design with early-fusion network structure combining visual observations and goal images using pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder, plus auxiliary tasks for enhanced global navigation representation learning; (2) Data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently labeling large-scale game video datasets and augmenting existing navigation datasets with diverse gameplay videos.

Result: PIG-Nav achieves 22.6% average improvement in zero-shot settings and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings compared to existing visual navigation foundation models. Performance was evaluated across two complex simulated environments and one real-world environment, with the model requiring significantly less fine-tuning data while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The study advances state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models by identifying critical design choices and demonstrating that augmenting datasets with game videos improves performance. The model's ability to maintain strong performance with minimal labeled supervision highlights its potential for practical real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

### [36] [MaskedCLIP: Bridging the Masked and CLIP Space for Semi-Supervised Medical Vision-Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17239)
*Lei Zhu,Jun Zhou,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MaskedCLIP, a framework that combines masked image modeling with contrastive language-image pre-training to leverage both paired and unpaired medical image data for learning more generalizable foundation models in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models in medical image analysis are limited by using either only paired image-text data or only unpaired image data, which restricts their ability to learn comprehensive image features. There's a need to fully utilize both types of data to create more powerful foundation models.

Method: The authors propose MaskedCLIP, which uses a bridge transformer to connect masked feature space with CLIP feature space, addressing the incompatibility between paired and unpaired data. They also introduce masked knowledge distillation loss to transfer semantic knowledge from CLIP features back to masked features, creating a mutually interactive learning framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate that MaskedCLIP effectively leverages both paired and unpaired image data, showing improved effectiveness and data efficiency compared to existing methods that use only one type of data.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training approach successfully combines the strengths of both paired and unpaired data learning paradigms, resulting in more generalizable image features for downstream medical image analysis tasks through the synergistic use of masked image modeling and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models as feature extractors to detect AI-generated images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a simple two-layer network while maintaining robustness against image degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of generative AI models, there's an increasing influx of AI-generated content on the internet. While existing GenAI detection methods have improved, there's a need for more robust and generalizable approaches that can distinguish between real and AI-generated images across different generative models and maintain performance under various image degradations.

Method: The authors leverage existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models as feature extractors, utilizing their ability to capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass statistical space. They train a simple two-layer neural network on the feature representations from IQA models to classify images as real or AI-generated, and evaluate the approach's generalization across different generative models and robustness against image degradations.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting AI-generated images across various generative models. The two-layer network trained on IQA feature space demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen generative models and maintains significant robustness when tested against various image degradations.

Conclusion: IQA models can be effectively repurposed for AI-generated image detection by leveraging their inherent understanding of real image statistics. This approach provides a robust and generalizable solution for GenAI detection that outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency through a simple two-layer architecture.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates manual annotation requirements, uses emulated ISP pipeline data for training, and achieves better performance than supervised methods while using only 0.01% of their parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current exposure correction methods face three key challenges: labor-intensive paired data annotation, limited generalizability due to individual style biases, and performance degradation in low-level computer vision tasks. These limitations hinder practical deployment and effectiveness.

Method: The authors develop an unsupervised learning approach that trains on freely available paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline instead of manual annotations. They create a large-scale Radiometry Correction Dataset emphasizing exposure variations and design a transformation function that preserves image details efficiently.

Result: The proposed UEC method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods while using only 0.01% of their parameters. The method demonstrates improved generalizability by avoiding annotation biases and shows effectiveness in downstream tasks like edge detection, successfully mitigating adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features.

Conclusion: The unsupervised exposure correction approach successfully addresses the key limitations of existing methods by eliminating annotation requirements, improving generalizability, and enhancing performance in low-level computer vision tasks, while being significantly more parameter-efficient than supervised alternatives.

Abstract: Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods

*Asir Saadat,Syem Aziz,Shahriar Mahmud,Abdullah Ibne Masud Mahi,Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VisionTrap, a dataset for evaluating whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can appropriately abstain from answering unanswerable questions about unrealistic or impossible images, rather than generating incorrect responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Visual Question Answering (VQA) research has extensively studied how VLMs respond to answerable questions on real-world images, there has been limited exploration of how these models handle unanswerable questions where they should abstain from responding. Understanding whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge is crucial for reliable VQA systems.

Method: The researchers created VisionTrap, a dataset containing three categories of unanswerable questions: (1) hybrid entities fusing objects and animals, (2) objects in unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent figures. They tested VLMs on these logically structured but inherently unanswerable questions to assess whether models can recognize their limitations.

Result: The study reveals that VLMs often attempt to generate answers even when they should abstain from responding to unanswerable questions about unrealistic or impossible images. This highlights a significant limitation in current VLM behavior regarding knowledge boundary recognition.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of incorporating unanswerable questions into VQA benchmarks to properly evaluate whether models can appropriately abstain from answering when they should, rather than generating potentially incorrect responses. This is crucial for developing more reliable and trustworthy VQA systems.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

*Kailong Zhang,Youwei Lyu,Heng Guo,Si Li,Zhanyu Ma,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarAnything is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes photorealistic polarization images from single RGB inputs, eliminating the need for 3D assets and enabling broader application of polarization imaging techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization cameras have limited accessibility, hindering the broader application of polarization imaging for enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks. Existing simulators like Mitsuba require extensive 3D assets and cannot generate large-scale photorealistic images, creating a need for more accessible polarization image synthesis methods.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion-based generative framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models' zero-shot capabilities. They develop an effective representation strategy that preserves polarization property fidelity while synthesizing images from single RGB inputs without requiring 3D asset collections.

Result: The model successfully generates high-quality polarization images with both photorealism and physical accuracy. The generated images support downstream applications such as shape from polarization tasks, demonstrating practical utility.

Conclusion: PolarAnything addresses the accessibility limitations of polarization imaging by providing a practical solution for synthesizing polarization images from RGB inputs, potentially enabling broader adoption of polarization-based computer vision techniques without requiring specialized hardware or extensive 3D assets.

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

### [41] [Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281)
*Huanli Zhuo,Leilei Ma,Haifeng Zhao,Shiwei Zhou,Dengdi Sun,Yanping Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FA-SAM is a single-source domain generalization framework that enables fully automated medical image segmentation using SAM by automatically generating prompts and mitigating the impact of poor prompts through uncertainty modeling and embedding fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM-based models for medical image segmentation face two major challenges: (1) dependency on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts preventing fully automated segmentation in clinical settings, and (2) poor prompts (e.g., inappropriate bounding box sizes) can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results.

Method: The paper proposes FA-SAM with two key innovations: (1) An Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch with Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module that models uncertainty distribution of shallow features to automatically generate bounding box prompts, and (2) An Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into SAM mask decoder that combines multiscale information from SAM image and prompt embeddings to capture global and local object details.

Result: Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM in achieving fully automated medical image segmentation while addressing the challenges of prompt dependency and poor prompt robustness.

Conclusion: FA-SAM successfully addresses key limitations of SAM-based medical image segmentation by enabling fully automated operation through automatic prompt generation and improving robustness against poor prompts, demonstrating significant potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

*Xuanyu Lin,Xiaona Zeng,Xianwei Zheng,Xutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointLAMA is a point cloud pretraining framework that combines Mamba backbone with Latent Attention blocks and conditional diffusion to efficiently model 3D point clouds while capturing both global sequences and local geometric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba models, while efficient for global sequence modeling with linear complexity, lack local inductive bias needed to capture fine-grained geometric structures in 3D point cloud data, limiting their effectiveness for point cloud tasks.

Method: The method introduces three key components: (1) task-aware point cloud serialization using Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert curves and axis-wise sorting for different tasks, (2) a hybrid encoder combining Latent Attention blocks with Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA) and Mamba blocks for enhanced local context modeling, and (3) a conditional diffusion mechanism for feature sequence denoising during pretraining.

Result: PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining minimal parameter count and FLOPs, demonstrating effective and efficient point cloud pretraining capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed PointLAMA framework successfully addresses Mamba's limitation in local geometric modeling by integrating Latent Attention and conditional diffusion, resulting in an efficient point cloud pretraining approach that balances global sequence modeling with local structure capture.

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for assembly process monitoring using minimal visual sensors achieves 92% accuracy while reducing hardware costs and providing real-time operator guidance in Industry 4.0 environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional assembly monitoring methods rely on multiple sensor types or complex hardware setups that are cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial environments, creating a need for more practical solutions using minimal visual sensors.

Method: Integration of multiple machine learning models that process state information from identical timestamps using only visual sensors to detect and confirm assembly process stages, with enhanced error detection and visualization capabilities.

Result: The approach achieved an average accuracy exceeding 92% in detecting assembly process stages, while providing enhanced error detection, visualization capabilities, and real-time actionable guidance to operators.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more practical solution for assembly monitoring by improving accuracy and efficiency while reducing dependency on expensive hardware, making it suitable for modern industrial applications in Industry 4.0 contexts.

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

*Peiqi Chen,Lei Yu,Yi Wan,Yingying Pei,Xinyi Liu,Yongxiang Yao,Yingying Zhang,Lixiang Ru,Liheng Zhong,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasP introduces a novel cascaded correspondence pipeline for semi-dense feature matching that decomposes matching into two progressive phases with region-based selective cross-attention, achieving ~2.2× speedup over ELoFTR while maintaining superior accuracy and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-dense feature matching methods rely on global search across entire feature maps to establish coarse matches, which limits improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. This global search approach creates computational bottlenecks and prevents further performance gains.

Method: CasP decomposes the matching stage into two progressive phases bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism. The first phase identifies one-to-many prior areas, and the second phase determines one-to-one matches by restricting search to these prior regions. The pipeline also incorporates high-level features to reduce computational costs of low-level feature extraction.

Result: The lite model achieves ~2.2× speedup at 1152 resolution compared to ELoFTR (the most efficient existing method). The acceleration gains increase with higher resolution. Extensive experiments show superiority in geometric estimation with impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: CasP demonstrates significant potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications such as SLAM and UAV systems by providing both computational efficiency and improved accuracy through its cascaded correspondence approach with selective attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

*Chao He,Jianqiang Ren,Jianjing Xiang,Xiejie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CartoonAlive is a method that generates high-quality Live2D digital humans from a single portrait image in under 30 seconds by using facial blendshapes and keypoint detection, offering an efficient alternative to complex 3D modeling or inflexible 2D video approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital human approaches focus mainly on 3D models (requiring complex modeling and high rendering costs) or 2D video-based representations (lacking flexibility and real-time interactivity), while interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans receive less attention despite Live2D models offering more efficient and expressive alternatives through layered segmentation without traditional 3D modeling.

Method: CartoonAlive leverages the shape basis concept from 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes suitable for Live2D, then infers corresponding blendshape weights based on facial keypoints detected from the input portrait image to generate Live2D models that simulate 3D-like motion through layered segmentation.

Result: The method can rapidly generate highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D models that closely resemble the input portrait within less than half a minute, enabling dynamic and real-time manipulation of 2D cartoon-style digital humans.

Conclusion: CartoonAlive provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual character animation by offering an efficient alternative to existing digital human generation methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual

### [46] [PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17332)
*Hyeongjin Nam,Donghwan Kim,Gyeongsik Moon,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARTE introduces a novel 3D human reconstruction framework that leverages human part segmentation to achieve better texture alignment across different body parts, addressing the common issue of texture misalignment in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human reconstruction methods suffer from misaligned human textures across different body parts (like jackets blending into pants), and most methods don't explicitly utilize part segmentation information despite its importance for texture coherence in invisible regions from single images.

Method: The framework consists of two core components: (1) PartSegmenter - a 3D part segmentation module that reconstructs textureless human surface and predicts part labels, and (2) PartTexturer - a part-guided texturing module that incorporates part information using prior knowledge from pre-trained image generation networks for texture alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PARTE achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction, successfully addressing texture misalignment issues through explicit exploitation of human part segmentation priors.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that incorporating 3D human part information as guidance significantly improves texture reconstruction quality in 3D human reconstruction, leading to better structural coherence and texture alignment across different body parts.

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

*Weihua Gao,Chunxu Ren,Wenlong Niu,Xiaodong Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework for detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems without manual annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance at over 1000 FPS through temporal signal modeling and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems is challenging due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with robust feature extraction and lack reliable annotations, creating a need for annotation-free detection approaches.

Method: The paper proposes a Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that reformulates detection as pixel-wise temporal signal modeling. Key components include: (1) Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) with encoder-decoder architecture, (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module for enhanced sensitivity to temporal patterns, and (3) graph-based trajectory mining strategy for false alarm suppression and temporal consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring no human annotations. The system achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, demonstrating real-time capability.

Conclusion: The TPS framework successfully addresses weak target detection challenges by modeling temporal signals rather than using conventional frame-based detection. The annotation-free approach combined with high-speed processing makes it highly suitable for practical real-time surveillance applications.

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified license plate recognition system that combines a lightweight visual encoder with a text decoder, achieving 99.34-99.58% accuracy on single-line plates and 98.70% on double-line plates at 167 fps, using synthetic datasets and a perspective correction network to handle diverse imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: License plate recognition in open environments faces significant challenges due to the diversity of license plate types and imaging conditions, while existing CNN and CRNN-based approaches have limitations. Additionally, there is a scarcity of double-line license plate datasets for training robust recognition systems.

Method: The authors develop a unified solution integrating a lightweight visual encoder with a text decoder in a pre-training framework for Chinese license plates. They construct a synthetic dataset by combining synthesized images, texture mapping on real scenes, and authentic license plate images. They also introduce a perspective correction network (PTN) that uses license plate corner coordinate regression supervised by view classification information.

On double-line license plates, it achieves 98.70% accuracy with processing speeds up to 167 frames per second.

Conclusion: The proposed unified license plate recognition system demonstrates strong practical applicability with high accuracy rates and real-time processing capabilities. The perspective correction network provides improved stability and interpretability while maintaining low annotation costs, making it suitable for diverse license plate recognition tasks in open environments.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

### [49] [DeMo++: Motion Decoupling for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17342)
*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMo++ is a motion forecasting and planning framework that decouples motion estimation into holistic motion intentions and fine spatiotemporal states, using a hybrid Attention-Mamba model to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple autonomous driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-query-one-trajectory methods for motion forecasting struggle to model intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, leading to potential collisions or suboptimal outcomes in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes DeMo++, which decouples motion estimation into two components: (1) holistic motion intentions for capturing diverse movement directions, and (2) fine spatiotemporal states for tracking dynamic progress and enabling self-refinement. A cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism explores relationships between motions in adjacent scenes. The framework is implemented using a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba architectures.

Result: DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Conclusion: The decoupled approach of separating motion intentions from spatiotemporal states, combined with cross-scene interaction mechanisms and hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture, effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance across multiple autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

### [50] [Principled Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17343)
*Xiaohao Liu,Xiaobo Xia,See-Kiong Ng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMRL is a novel multimodal representation learning framework that aligns multiple modalities simultaneously without anchor dependency by optimizing the dominant singular value of representation matrices, achieving better stability and performance than traditional pairwise contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal representation learning methods rely on pairwise contrastive learning with predefined anchor modalities, which restricts alignment across all modalities. Existing simultaneous alignment approaches face challenges like fixed anchor point limitations and optimization instability from singular value products.

Method: PMRL leverages the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix and optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. It uses a softmax-based loss function treating singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value, plus instance-wise contrastive regularization on leading eigenvectors to maintain inter-instance separability.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods in multimodal representation learning performance.

Conclusion: PMRL successfully addresses the limitations of traditional anchor-dependent methods by providing a more stable approach to simultaneous multimodal alignment through dominant singular value optimization, achieving better performance across various multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Swin-TUNA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that achieves high-performance food image segmentation by updating only 4% of parameters, reducing computational demands while outperforming existing large-scale models like FoodSAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large-scale Transformer-based models for food image segmentation (like FoodSAM) have massive parameter counts and high computational demands that make them impractical for industrial deployment, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: The paper proposes Swin-TUNA, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that integrates multiscale trainable adapters into Swin Transformer architecture. It uses hierarchical feature adaptation with separable convolutions, dimensional mappings of varying scales, and a dynamic balancing strategy for task-agnostic and task-specific features.

Result: Swin-TUNA achieves mIoU of 50.56% on FoodSeg103 dataset and 74.94% on UECFoodPix Complete dataset, surpassing the fully parameterized FoodSAM model while reducing parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M parameters). It also shows faster convergence and stronger generalization in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Swin-TUNA method successfully addresses the deployment challenges of large-scale food segmentation models by providing superior performance with dramatically reduced computational requirements, making it suitable for practical industrial applications and lightweight food image processing systems.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for

*Yuzhe Zhu,Lile Cai,Kangkang Lu,Fayao Liu,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes active learning strategies to reduce the annotation cost for training semantically-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), achieving over 2X reduction in labeling requirements compared to random sampling by incorporating 3D geometric constraints in sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training semantically-aware NeRFs requires expensive pixel-level class labels. The authors aim to reduce this annotation burden through active learning, making semantic NeRF training more practical and cost-effective.

Method: The authors investigate various active learning design choices including selection granularity and selection strategies for semantically-aware NeRF training. They propose a novel active learning strategy that incorporates 3D geometric constraints in the sample selection process.

Result: The experiments show that active learning can effectively reduce annotation costs for training semantically-aware NeRF, achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random sampling approaches.

Conclusion: Active learning is a viable solution for reducing the expensive annotation requirements of semantically-aware NeRFs, with the proposed 3D geometry-aware selection strategy significantly outperforming random sampling in terms of annotation efficiency.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random
sampling.

*Lile Cai,Ramanpreet Singh Pahwa,Xun Xu,Jie Wang,Richard Chang,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning approach for semiconductor X-Ray microscopy defect detection that addresses domain shift and class imbalance through contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample selection, reducing annotation requirements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for semiconductor XRM defect identification require large amounts of annotated data which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. The authors aim to reduce annotation burden through active learning while addressing unique challenges of large domain shift and severe class imbalance in semiconductor XRM scans.

Method: The authors propose a two-pronged approach: (1) contrastive pretraining on unlabelled data to obtain initialization weights for each active learning cycle, addressing domain shift issues, and (2) a rareness-aware acquisition function that prioritizes selection of samples containing rare classes to handle severe class imbalance problems.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a semiconductor dataset compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory structures (logic and memory dies), demonstrating effective reduction in annotation requirements while maintaining competitive results.

Conclusion: Active learning with contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample selection successfully addresses the key challenges of domain shift and class imbalance in semiconductor XRM analysis, providing an effective solution to reduce annotation burden while achieving strong performance for defect identification tasks.

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [54] [Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367)
*Lile Cai,Xun Xu,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a region-based active learning framework for semantic segmentation that incorporates spatial diversity alongside traditional uncertainty measures to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale labeled datasets for semantic segmentation incur high annotation costs due to dense pixel-level labeling requirements. The paper aims to reduce these costs through strategic region selection for labeling rather than annotating entire images.

Method: The authors develop a unified optimization framework that combines local spatial diversity with traditional active selection criteria (uncertainty and feature diversity) for region-based active learning in semantic segmentation tasks.

Result: The framework achieves 95% performance of fully supervised methods using only 5-9% of labeled pixels on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets, outperforming all existing state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Enforcing local spatial diversity in region-based active learning significantly improves performance compared to uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based methods alone, providing an effective strategy for reducing annotation costs in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

### [55] [SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17373)
*Keon-Hee Park,Seun-An Choe,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), which adapts pre-trained object detectors to new domains without source data while detecting both known and unknown objects, using the CollaPAUL framework that combines collaborative tuning and principal axis-based unknown labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing source-free object detection methods operate under restrictive closed-set assumptions where only pre-defined objects from the source domain can be detected in the target domain. This prevents detection of undefined objects that may exist in real-world target domains, limiting practical applicability.

Method: The authors propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling) framework with two key components: (1) Collaborative tuning that integrates target-dependent knowledge from an auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector using cross-domain attention, and (2) Principal axes-based unknown labeling that assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness through principal axes projection and confidence scores.

Result: CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performance on SFUOD benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting both known objects from the source domain and unknown objects in the target domain without requiring access to labeled source data during adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed SFUOD scenario and CollaPAUL framework successfully address the limitation of closed-set assumptions in source-free domain adaptation, enabling practical object detection that can handle both known and unknown objects in target domains without requiring source data access.

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

### [56] [A Conditional Probability Framework for Compositional Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17377)
*Peng Wu,Qiuxia Lai,Hao Fang,Guo-Sen Xie,Yilong Yin,Xiankai Lu,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that models attribute-object dependencies by decomposing composition probability into object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood, using textual descriptors and cross-attention to improve generalization to unseen attribute-object combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CZSL approaches treat attributes and objects as independent entities, overlooking semantic constraints and contextual dependencies within compositions. For example, certain attributes naturally pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" with "zebra" but not "sky"), and the same attribute can manifest differently in different contexts (e.g., "young tree" vs. "young dog"). This independence assumption fails to capture crucial attribute-object interdependencies.

Method: The authors adopt a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) that decomposes composition probability into two components: object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood. They incorporate textual descriptors to enhance object feature learning by highlighting semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism to ensure better contextual alignment between attributes and objects.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods. The method effectively captures compositional dependencies and shows improved generalization to unseen attribute-object combinations.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling attribute-object dependencies through conditional probability decomposition and using textual descriptors with cross-attention mechanisms, the proposed CPF framework successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of capturing compositional dependencies in CZSL, leading to better performance on recognizing unseen attribute-object combinations.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoGen is the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that uses autoregressive modeling with Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) and Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) to generate high-quality endoscopic videos for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous endoscopic video generation methods either focused on static images lacking dynamic context or used unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful clinical references. There was a need for conditional video generation that could enhance medical imaging and diagnostic capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes EndoGen, an autoregressive model with two key components: (1) Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy that reformulates multi-frame generation as grid-based image generation to leverage global dependency modeling, and (2) Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism that selectively focuses on semantically meaningful regions during generation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content. The generated videos also improve performance on downstream polyp segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EndoGen successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by providing the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that produces clinically relevant, high-quality dynamic content for medical applications.

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiProbe-VAD is a training-free video anomaly detection framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by extracting informative hidden states from intermediate layers using Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing, achieving superior performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video anomaly detection methods face significant challenges including substantial computational demands and heavy reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which restricts their practical applicability. There is a need for more efficient and scalable solutions that can work without requiring fine-tuning or large training datasets.

Method: The paper proposes HiProbe-VAD, which uses a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism to intelligently identify and extract the most informative hidden states from optimal intermediate layers of pre-trained MLLMs during reasoning. The framework includes a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module that processes these extracted hidden states to detect anomalies and generate explanations.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets show that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free methods and most traditional approaches. The framework demonstrates remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities across different MLLMs without requiring any tuning, proving the effectiveness of leveraging intermediate hidden states for anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain more information-rich representations with higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to output layers. HiProbe-VAD unlocks the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection, paving the way for more practical and scalable training-free solutions in this domain.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

TL;DR: HLFormer introduces the first hyperbolic modeling framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), using hyperbolic space learning to better capture hierarchical video structures and improve matching between untrimmed videos and partial text queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks hierarchical semantics, leading to suboptimal temporal modeling when matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.

Method: HLFormer integrates Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, uses Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module for dynamic feature fusion, and introduces Partial Order Preservation Loss with Lorentzian cone constraints to enforce "text < video" hierarchy for enhanced cross-modal matching.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in partially relevant video retrieval tasks, showing improved performance in matching videos with partial text queries.

Conclusion: The proposed hyperbolic modeling framework successfully addresses the limitations of Euclidean space in capturing hierarchical video structures, providing a more effective approach for partially relevant video retrieval through hybrid space encoding and hierarchical constraint enforcement.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal

modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms

*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Chuqiao Li,Diogo Luvizon,Rishabh Dabral,Martin Oswald,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoviCam, the first non-synthetic dataset with ground-truth camera trajectories and 3D human motion, and proposes PhysDynPose, a physics-based method for accurate human pose tracking with moving cameras and non-flat scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods suffer from artifacts when dealing with non-flat ground planes or moving cameras, and current evaluation datasets either lack ground-truth data or use synthetic data that fails to model real-world conditions like light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced changes.

Method: PhysDynPose combines a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator for human pose estimation with a robust SLAM method to capture dynamic camera trajectory, enabling recovery of human pose in world frame. The method then refines the kinematic pose estimate using a scene-aware physics optimizer that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints.

Result: The new benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art methods struggle with moving cameras and non-planar environments, while PhysDynPose robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates. The MoviCam dataset provides the first non-synthetic benchmark with ground-truth camera trajectories, scene geometry, and 3D human motion with human-scene contact labels.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses limitations in human pose tracking by providing a realistic benchmark dataset and a physics-based method that handles challenging scenarios with moving cameras and complex scene geometry, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method for content-based medical image retrieval that adapts ColBERT's late interaction mechanism to 3D medical imaging, eliminating the need for pre-segmented data while improving tumor detection and staging across multiple anatomical sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of medical images creates challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Existing content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies, and current approaches rely on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, which doesn't align with real-world clinical practice using large unstructured image archiving systems like PACS.

Method: The authors developed C-MIR, a volumetric re-ranking method that adapts ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging. They created a framework that eliminates reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, making it compatible with clinical PACS systems. The method was evaluated across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations.

Result: C-MIR demonstrated significant advantages in medical image retrieval, successfully adapting the late interaction principle to volumetric medical images for effective context-aware re-ranking. The method showed improved performance in tumor flagging, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05), and demonstrated potential for improving tumor staging. C-MIR effectively localized regions of interest without requiring pre-segmentation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems requiring expensive data enrichment.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and practical healthcare applications. C-MIR offers a promising solution for improving diagnostic processes by providing efficient content-based image retrieval without the computational overhead of pre-segmentation, making it more suitable for real-world clinical implementation in PACS systems.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPRI-CT is a causal-aware deep learning framework that integrates CT images with acquisition metadata to optimize image quality while minimizing radiation exposure through predictive modeling and counterfactual inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key clinical challenge in CT imaging is achieving high image quality while minimizing radiation exposure to patients. Current approaches lack the ability to predict image quality outcomes and perform what-if simulations without repeated physical scans.

Method: The method uses an ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to extract features and generate causal representations from CT images and acquisition metadata (tube voltage, current, contrast agents). These features are fused to predict Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and enable counterfactual inference for parameter optimization.

Result: CAPRI-CT achieved strong predictive performance using ensemble learning approach and successfully enables what-if simulations for changes in contrast agents and scan parameters, providing actionable insights for CT protocol optimization.

Conclusion: CAPRI-CT provides both prediction and interpretability capabilities that can help radiologists and technicians design more efficient CT protocols without requiring repeated physical scans, potentially improving clinical workflow and patient safety.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

*Yehao Lu,Minghe Weng,Zekang Xiao,Rui Jiang,Wei Su,Guangcong Zheng,Ping Lu,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic-DINO, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to real-time open-vocabulary object detection by extending Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge with dynamic inference and efficient MoE-Tuning, achieving better performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MoE architecture has proven successful in Large Vision-Language Models, its potential in real-time open-vocabulary object detectors remains unexplored. The authors aim to investigate how MoE can benefit smaller models that also leverage vision-language datasets for object detection tasks.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic-DINO with three key components: (1) MoE-Tuning strategy to convert dense models to dynamic inference frameworks, (2) granularity decomposition mechanism that breaks down Feed-Forward Networks into multiple smaller expert networks, and (3) pre-trained weight allocation strategy with specific router initialization to prevent performance degradation during fine-tuning.

Result: Dynamic-DINO, pretrained with only 1.56M open-source data, outperforms the baseline Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge model that was pretrained on the much larger private Grounding20M dataset. The method demonstrates effective expert collaboration patterns in different network layers.

Conclusion: MoE architecture can be successfully applied to real-time open-vocabulary object detection, with distinct expert collaboration patterns emerging at different network depths. The proposed Dynamic-DINO framework achieves superior performance while requiring significantly less training data than traditional dense models.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

*Sania Waheed,Na Min An,Michael Milford,Sarvapali D. Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid geo-localization framework that combines vision-language models (VLMs) with visual place recognition (VPR) methods to achieve scalable and accurate location estimation from single images at planet scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geo-localization methods face significant challenges: retrieval-based methods struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive training data. Although VLMs show promise with contextual understanding, they suffer from hallucinations and lack interpretability as standalone solutions.

Method: A novel hybrid framework that first uses a VLM to generate geographic priors that guide and constrain the retrieval search space, followed by a retrieval step and re-ranking mechanism that selects the most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity to initially estimated coordinates.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple geo-localization benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 4.51% at street level and up to 13.52% at city level.

Conclusion: VLM-generated geographic priors combined with VPR methods create scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization systems that effectively address the limitations of individual approaches while leveraging their complementary strengths.

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

*Francesco Tonini,Lorenzo Vaquero,Alessandro Conti,Cigdem Beyan,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DYSCO, a training-free framework for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection that leverages Vision-Language Models to overcome the limitations of manual annotation dependency by using multimodal representations and innovative interaction signatures for better generalization to rare interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods heavily rely on large manually annotated datasets, which are labor-intensive, prone to inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. The authors argue that Vision-Language Models offer untapped potential for enhancing interaction representation that current methods haven't fully exploited.

Method: DYSCO uses a multimodal registry that combines textual and visual interaction representations, incorporates visual cues with innovative interaction signatures to improve semantic alignment of verbs, and employs a multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights visual and textual feature contributions for robust interaction understanding.

Result: DYSCO surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with training-based approaches, with particular excellence in detecting rare interactions. The framework demonstrates effective generalization capabilities without requiring training on annotated datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that training-free HOI detection can achieve competitive performance by effectively leveraging Vision-Language Models through enhanced semantic representations and adaptive multimodal fusion, particularly excelling in rare interaction scenarios where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

### [66] [ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462)
*Chang Nie,Guangming Wang,Zhe Lie,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMV is a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits 4D multi-view sequential images for robot imitation learning, addressing data scarcity issues in Vision-Language-Action models through innovative attention mechanisms and sparse sampling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot imitation learning faces severe constraints due to high data collection costs and scarcity of high-quality 4D multi-view sequential images, which limits the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Existing data augmentation methods lack capabilities for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks.

Method: ERMV employs three key innovations: (1) Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism to maintain spatio-temporal consistency by learning pixel shifts from movement before applying geometric constraints; (2) Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module that decouples temporal and spatial views and uses sparse sampling to reduce computational demands while maximizing editing working window; (3) feedback intervention mechanism using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request expert guidance when needed.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ERMV-augmented data significantly enhances the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments, successfully addressing the three core challenges of maintaining consistency across dynamic views, expanding working windows with low computational costs, and preserving semantic integrity of critical objects.

Conclusion: ERMV successfully addresses the data scarcity problem in robot imitation learning by providing an efficient framework for editing 4D multi-view sequential images. The proposed innovations in attention mechanisms, sparse sampling, and feedback intervention enable robust data augmentation that significantly improves VLA model performance across different environments.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

### [67] [Probing Vision-Language Understanding through the Visual Entailment Task: promises and pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17467)
*Elena Pitta,Tom Kouwenhoven,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Visual Entailment (VE) as a probe for vision-language understanding using LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision, finding that while fine-tuning achieves strong performance (83.3% accuracy), the task may have limitations in truly assessing visual grounding due to models' over-reliance on linguistic priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Visual Entailment serves as a reliable probe for vision-language understanding in multimodal language models, and to understand the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task beyond just reporting performance metrics.

Method: Conducted experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model. Explored factors including prompt design, number and order of in-context examples, and access to visual information. Used explanation-based evaluations to probe reasoning processes and tested model performance with limited vision to assess visual grounding.

Result: Three-shot inference outperformed zero-shot baselines, but additional examples introduced noise. Label order in prompts critically influenced predictions. Without visual information, the model hallucinated content. Fine-tuning achieved 83.3% accuracy on e-SNLI-VE dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art OFA-X model. Fine-tuned model provided semantically meaningful explanations with 89.2% BERTScore F1-score, but comparable scores in limited vision experiments raised concerns about visual grounding.

Conclusion: The results highlight both utility and limitations of VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding. While models can achieve strong performance, their over-reliance on linguistic priors and limited visual grounding suggest the need for refining multimodal evaluation methods to better assess true vision-language integration.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

*Chuang Chen,Xiaolin Qin,Jing Hu,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRMambaV2 is a novel sparse point cloud upsampling method for autonomous driving that uses biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention and dual-branch architecture to improve upsampling accuracy in long-range sparse regions while maintaining geometric reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving is challenging due to inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures. Existing methods that convert 3D scenes to 2D image super-resolution tasks struggle with sparse and blurry feature representation, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct detailed spatial topologies.

Method: The paper proposes SRMambaV2 with three key components: (1) a biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism inspired by human driver visual perception to model feature distribution in distant sparse areas, (2) a dual-branch network architecture to enhance sparse feature representation, and (3) a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function to refine fine-grained detail reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that SRMambaV2 achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness in automotive sparse point cloud upsampling tasks with improved accuracy in long-range sparse regions.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2 successfully addresses the challenges of sparse point cloud upsampling in autonomous driving by combining biomimetic attention mechanisms, dual-branch architecture, and adaptive loss functions, resulting in enhanced upsampling accuracy while preserving geometric reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnoBFN, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method based on Bayesian Flow Networks for neuroimaging, specifically designed to detect Alzheimer's disease-related anomalies in FDG PET images while preserving subject specificity and reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection is crucial in neuroimaging for identifying deviations from healthy subject data to facilitate diagnosis of neurological disorders. Existing methods have limitations in handling spatially correlated noise and preserving subject-specific characteristics during anomaly detection.

Method: The authors propose AnoBFN, an extension of Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) that combines diffusion frameworks with Bayesian inference. The method is designed to perform conditional image generation under high levels of spatially correlated noise and preserve subject specificity through recursive feedback from the input image throughout the generative process.

Result: AnoBFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods including VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and diffusion models (AnoDDPM) on Alzheimer's disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images, demonstrating superior effectiveness at detecting anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Conclusion: AnoBFN successfully adapts Bayesian Flow Networks for medical imaging anomaly detection, showing superior performance compared to existing approaches by effectively handling spatially correlated noise and maintaining subject specificity, making it a promising tool for neurological disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

*Minglong Xue,Aoxiang Ning,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Mingliang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DFDNet, a novel frequency-domain approach for removing lens flare artifacts in nighttime photography by decoupling content from flare information in the frequency domain and using contrastive learning for local detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deflare methods struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural damage near light sources in nighttime photography. The authors observed that flare artifacts show more significant discrepancies in the frequency domain compared to spatial domain, motivating a frequency-based approach.

Method: DFDNet uses two main components: (1) Global Dynamic Frequency-domain Guidance (GDFG) module that dynamically optimizes global frequency features to separate flare from content information, and (2) Local Detail Guidance Module (LDGM) using contrastive learning to align local light source features with reference images for fine-grained restoration.

Result: Experimental results show that DFDNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in deflare performance, effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts while preserving local details and reducing structural damage near light sources.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain approach with dynamic guidance and contrastive learning successfully addresses the limitations of existing deflare methods, providing superior performance in removing complex flare artifacts while maintaining image quality and structural integrity.

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of deep learning methods for X-ray object detection in security screening, systematically benchmarking 10 state-of-the-art detection schemes across 6 large-scale datasets to provide insights into performance, efficiency, and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated X-ray inspection faces significant challenges including object occlusion, material property variations, device diversity, and limited training data. Despite extensive research, experimental evaluations are often incomplete with conflicting results, creating a need for systematic comparison to understand the research landscape and guide future work.

Result: The systematic evaluation revealed critical insights about: overall behavior patterns of detection schemes, object-level detection performance variations, dataset-specific characteristics and challenges, and trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The study provides benchmark results across all tested combinations of methods and datasets.

Conclusion: This comprehensive comparative study establishes important benchmarks for X-ray object detection research and identifies key performance patterns across different architectures and datasets. The publicly available evaluation code and model weights support reproducibility and will facilitate future research in automated X-ray security screening.

Abstract: Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security

architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and

TL;DR: CompactFusion is a compression framework that reduces communication overhead in parallel diffusion model inference by exploiting temporal redundancy in activations, achieving significant speedups while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require substantial computational resources and multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment, but parallel inference suffers from significant communication overhead due to exchanging large activations between devices, which limits efficiency and scalability.

Method: CompactFusion uses Residual Compression to transmit only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences) instead of full activations, exploiting the observation that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy. The method also integrates lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation.

Result: On 4xL20, CompactFusion achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity compared to prior methods. It also enables communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based methods.

Conclusion: CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference that delivers lower latency and significantly higher generation quality. The framework applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework, and is publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

### [73] [URPO: A Unified Reward & Policy Optimization Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17515)
*Songshuo Lu,Hua Wang,Zhi Chen,Yaohua Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URPO is a novel framework that unifies reward modeling and policy optimization in a single model and training phase, eliminating the need for separate reward models and achieving superior performance on instruction-following and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional alignment pipelines use separate policy and reward models with frozen parameters during RL, creating complex, resource-intensive pipelines with performance limitations due to static reward signals. There's a need for a more efficient and effective approach to language model alignment.

Method: URPO unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The method recasts all alignment data (preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, open-ended instructions) into a unified generative format optimized in a single training loop, enabling the model to learn from ground-truth preferences while generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-7B show URPO significantly outperforms baselines: instruction-following score on AlpacaEval improved from 42.24 to 44.84, composite reasoning average increased from 32.66 to 35.66, and RewardBench score reached 85.15, surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55).

Conclusion: URPO eliminates the need for separate reward models and creates a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, presenting a simpler, more efficient, and more effective approach to achieving robustly aligned language models compared to traditional alignment pipelines.

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.

*Tian Guo,Hui Yuan,Xiaolong Mao,Shiqi Jiang,Raouf Hamzaoui,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STQE, a spatial-temporal network that enhances the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds by exploiting spatial and temporal correlations, achieving significant improvements in PSNR and BD-rate reductions across color components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds, and the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored, creating a gap in improving visual quality of compressed dynamic point clouds.

Method: The STQE network includes four key components: (1) a recoloring-based motion compensation module for precise inter-frame geometric alignment, (2) a channel-aware temporal attention module for highlighting relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, (3) a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module for capturing spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and (4) a joint loss function based on Pearson correlation coefficient to reduce over-smoothing effects.

Result: When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with BD-rate reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed STQE network successfully exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to significantly enhance the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds, demonstrating substantial improvements in both PSNR metrics and bitrate efficiency across all color components.

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%
for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

### [75] [Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training for Improved Point Cloud Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17533)
*Liwen Liu,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPT is a multi-modal multi-task pre-training framework that enhances 3D point cloud understanding by combining three pre-training tasks: token-level reconstruction, point-level reconstruction, and multi-modal contrastive learning, achieving better performance than existing single-task approaches without requiring 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal pre-training frameworks for 3D representations rely on single pre-training tasks, which limits their ability to gather abundant information from other relevant tasks and hinders performance in downstream tasks, especially in complex and diverse domains.

Method: The paper proposes MMPT framework with three pre-training tasks: (1) Token-level reconstruction (TLR) to recover masked point tokens for representative learning, (2) Point-level reconstruction (PLR) to predict masked point positions directly, and (3) Multi-modal contrastive learning (MCL) to combine feature correspondences within and across 3D point cloud and 2D image modalities in a self-supervised manner.

Result: The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various downstream tasks, and evaluation on widely-used benchmarks shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both discriminant and generative applications.

Conclusion: MMPT successfully addresses the limitations of single-task pre-training by incorporating multiple complementary tasks, demonstrating improved 3D point cloud understanding without requiring 3D annotations, making it scalable for large datasets and effective for various downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

### [76] [An h-space Based Adversarial Attack for Protection Against Few-shot Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17554)
*Xide Xu,Sandesh Kamath,Muhammad Atif Butt,Bogdan Raducanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes HAAD and HAAD-KV, novel adversarial attack methods that protect private content from unauthorized customization by diffusion models by crafting perturbations in the semantic latent space (h-space) to degrade image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few samples raises significant privacy concerns regarding unauthorized modifications of private content, necessitating the development of protection mechanisms based on adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors propose HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models) that leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations in the semantic latent space (h-space) which encodes high-level features. They also introduce HAAD-KV, a more efficient variant that constructs perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space.

Result: Both HAAD and HAAD-KV methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in protecting against unauthorized customization. HAAD-KV offers stronger protection while being computationally less expensive than the original HAAD method.

Conclusion: The proposed h-space based adversarial attack methods effectively protect private content from unauthorized diffusion model customization, with HAAD-KV providing an optimal balance between protection strength and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

### [77] [Boosting Ray Search Procedure of Hard-label Attacks with Transfer-based Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17577)
*Chen Ma,Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Qi Xuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a prior-guided approach to improve the query efficiency of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks by incorporating transfer-based priors from surrogate models into gradient estimation for ray search optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-label black-box adversarial attacks face significant challenges due to high query costs in binary search for finding optimal ray directions. Existing gradient estimation methods using "sign tricks" are inefficient, requiring too many queries to achieve effective attacks.

Method: The authors develop a novel prior-guided gradient estimation approach that integrates transfer-based priors from surrogate models. Their method approximates the projection of the true gradient onto subspaces spanned by these priors and random directions, transforming the hard-label attack into a more efficient continuous optimization problem.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of query efficiency. The authors also provide theoretical analysis showing improved expected cosine similarities between estimated and true gradients.

Conclusion: The prior-guided approach successfully reduces query costs in hard-label adversarial attacks by leveraging surrogate model knowledge, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements over existing methods for black-box adversarial optimization.

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a unified annotation integration methodology using USD (Universal Scene Description) with application-specific USD flavors. They identify key challenges in utilizing holistic real-world scan datasets and develop corresponding mitigation strategies to address data volume, annotation format diversity, and compatibility issues.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong performance in two downstream applications: LLM-based scene editing achieves 80% success rate in enabling effective LLM understanding and adaptation of the 3D scan data, while robotic simulation achieves 87% success rate in policy learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed USD-based unified annotation integration methodology successfully addresses the challenges of utilizing real-world 3D scene scans, enabling effective deployment in diverse applications like LLM-based scene editing and robotic simulation with high success rates, thus unlocking the potential of real-world scan datasets for practical applications.

Abstract: Real-world 3D scene-level scans offer realism and can enable better
real-world generalizability for downstream applications. However, challenges
such as data volume, diverse annotation formats, and tool compatibility limit
their use. This paper demonstrates a methodology to effectively leverage these

USD, with application-specific USD flavors. We identify challenges in utilizing
holistic real-world scan datasets and present mitigation strategies. The

*Jie Wang,Zhendong Yang,Liansong Zong,Xiaobo Zhang,Dexian Wang,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2P-MMT is a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework that improves multimodal machine translation robustness by using reconstructed images from diffusion models instead of original images, filtering out visual noise while preserving semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art MMT approaches rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: D2P-MMT uses a dual-branch prompting framework that requires only source text and reconstructed images from pre-trained diffusion models. It employs joint training on both authentic and reconstructed images with a distributional alignment loss to ensure consistency between output distributions of the two branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset show that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art MMT approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed D2P-MMT framework successfully addresses the robustness issues in multimodal machine translation by leveraging diffusion-generated images that filter visual noise while maintaining semantic relevance, leading to improved translation quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Shuaifeng Zhi,Jiazhao Zhang,Zhoufeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RemixFusion introduces a novel residual-based mixed representation combining explicit TSDF grids with implicit neural modules for high-quality, large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction and camera tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit representations improve mapping completeness and memory efficiency over traditional explicit methods like TSDF, but suffer from lack of reconstruction details and time-consuming learning, hindering their application to large-scale online reconstruction.

Method: A residual-based mixed representation combining explicit coarse TSDF grid with implicit neural module that produces fine-grained residuals; multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment optimizing pose changes rather than poses directly; adaptive gradient amplification; local moving volume with divide-and-conquer design for efficient online learning.

Result: The method surpasses all state-of-the-art approaches (both explicit and implicit representations) in terms of accuracy for both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes, achieving detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget.

Conclusion: RemixFusion successfully addresses the limitations of purely implicit representations by combining explicit and implicit approaches, enabling high-quality camera tracking and efficient large-scale online reconstruction with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: PRIX is an efficient end-to-end autonomous driving model that uses only camera data to predict safe trajectories directly from raw pixels, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being more practical for real-world deployment than existing multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving models face deployment challenges due to large model sizes, expensive LiDAR sensor requirements, and computationally intensive BEV feature representations, limiting their scalability for mass-market vehicles with only cameras.

Method: The authors propose PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels), an end-to-end driving architecture that operates solely on camera data without BEV representation or LiDAR. It combines a visual feature extractor with a generative planning head and introduces the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT) module to enhance multi-level visual features for robust trajectory planning.

Result: PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching the capabilities of larger multimodal diffusion planners while being significantly more efficient in inference speed and model size.

Conclusion: PRIX demonstrates that camera-only autonomous driving can achieve competitive performance while being more practical for real-world deployment, offering a scalable solution for mass-market vehicles without expensive sensors or computational overhead.

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market

PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We

TL;DR: InvRGB+L is a novel inverse rendering model that uses both RGB and LiDAR intensity data to reconstruct large, relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single sequence, achieving superior results in urban scene reconstruction and LiDAR simulation compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional inverse graphics methods primarily rely on RGB observations and use LiDAR only for geometric information, leading to suboptimal material estimates due to visible light interference. The authors discovered that LiDAR's intensity values, captured with active illumination in a different spectral range, provide complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting conditions.

Method: The method introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model that incorporates LiDAR intensity information, and (2) RGB-LiDAR material consistency losses that ensure coherent material estimation across both modalities. The approach leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome challenges in RGB-centric inverse graphics.

Result: The model successfully produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR renderings of both urban and indoor scenes. It supports advanced applications including relighting, night simulations, and dynamic object insertions. The results surpass current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering and LiDAR simulation tasks.

Conclusion: InvRGB+L demonstrates that combining RGB and LiDAR intensity data significantly improves inverse rendering capabilities, particularly for large-scale dynamic scenes. The physics-based approach and material consistency constraints enable superior performance in complex scenarios like urban environments and low-light conditions.

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR

TL;DR: This study compares human visual attention patterns with Vision Transformer (ViT) attention mechanisms when evaluating handcrafted objects, finding that certain ViT attention heads can approximate human visual behavior with optimal correlation at specific parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The alignment between human visual attention patterns and ViT attention mechanisms remains underexplored, particularly in aesthetic contexts. Understanding this relationship could improve AI models for aesthetic evaluation and product design applications.

Method: Eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants viewing 20 artisanal objects (basketry bags and ginger jars) using Pupil Labs eye-tracker to generate human attention heat maps. Simultaneously analyzed the same objects using pre-trained ViT model with DINO, extracting attention maps from 12 attention heads. Compared attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0).

Result: Optimal correlation found at sigma=2.4 ±0.03, with attention head #12 showing strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences between attention heads were identified, with heads #7 and #9 showing greatest divergence from human attention (p<0.05). ViTs exhibited more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, but certain heads could approximate human behavior for specific features.

Conclusion: While ViTs show more global attention patterns than humans, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly for specific object features. This suggests potential applications in product design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences between human perception and current AI attention strategies.

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-stage architecture for lane topology understanding in autonomous driving that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines, and topology relationships, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing two-stage methods by reusing attention resources and enabling knowledge distillation from SD map-based models to SD map-free models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods for lane topology understanding suffer from inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads, making them suboptimal for safe autonomous driving applications that require accurate understanding of lane topology relationships.

Method: A one-stage architecture that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology relationships by reusing intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders, leveraging inherent relational knowledge from element detection without requiring additional computationally expensive graph networks, and implementing knowledge distillation from SD map-based models to SD map-free models.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and efficiency on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning, while demonstrating that knowledge distillation enables superior performance even without SD maps.

Conclusion: The proposed one-stage architecture successfully addresses the limitations of existing two-stage methods by improving both accuracy and inference speed for lane topology understanding, while pioneering knowledge distillation techniques that enable effective operation without standard definition maps, making it more practical for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

### [85] [The Early Bird Identifies the Worm: You Can't Beat a Head Start in Long-Term Body Re-ID (ECHO-BID)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17640)
*Thomas M. Metz,Matthew Q. Hill,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECHO-BID, a person re-identification model based on EVA-02 Large backbones that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term re-id tasks, especially in challenging scenarios with clothing changes and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person identification in unconstrained environments faces significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging conditions, and clothing changes. Existing methods struggle with long-term re-identification scenarios where people change clothes or appear in occluded settings.

Method: The authors developed ECHO-BID using object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones and compared it against 9 other models with systematic variations in backbone architecture, model size, pretraining scale, and transfer learning protocols. They utilized Masked Image Modeling during pretraining and employed transfer learning on challenging clothes-change datasets.

Result: ECHO-BID achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-identification benchmarks, substantially outperforming other methods. It also significantly exceeded other approaches in occluded viewing scenarios. The study found that smaller but more challenging transfer learning datasets generalized better across datasets, while larger datasets with additional fine-tuning performed best on the most difficult data.

Conclusion: The combination of increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining drives ECHO-BID's superior performance on long-term re-identification. The choice of appropriate pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols is crucial for achieving substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

### [86] [CNS-Bench: Benchmarking Image Classifier Robustness Under Continuous Nuisance Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17651)
*Olaf Dünkel,Artur Jesslen,Jiahao Xie,Christian Theobalt,Christian Rupprecht,Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNS-Bench, a continuous nuisance shift benchmark that uses diffusion models with LoRA adapters to generate realistic images with varying severity levels for evaluating out-of-distribution robustness of image classifiers, revealing that model rankings change across different shift types and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD robustness evaluation methods using simple synthetic corruptions fail to capture real-world nuisance shifts, and recent diffusion-based approaches are limited to binary shifts. There's a need for continuous, realistic evaluation of model robustness across varying severity levels of nuisance shifts.

Method: The authors develop CNS-Bench using LoRA adapters applied to diffusion models to generate continuous severity levels of individual nuisance shifts. They propose a filtering mechanism to address failure cases and enable reliable benchmarking with generative models.

Result: Large-scale evaluation of 40+ classifiers shows that model rankings change across different nuisance shifts and shift scales, which binary shifts cannot capture. The continuous evaluation reveals model failure points and provides more nuanced understanding of robustness compared to traditional binary approaches.

Conclusion: CNS-Bench enables more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of model robustness by providing continuous nuisance shifts that better reflect real-world scenarios. The benchmark reveals important insights about model behavior that are missed by traditional binary evaluation approaches, allowing for better understanding of model failure points and robustness characteristics.

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

### [87] [Attention (as Discrete-Time Markov) Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17657)
*Yotam Erel,Olaf Dünkel,Rishabh Dabral,Vladislav Golyanik,Christian Theobalt,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel interpretation of attention matrices in vision transformers as discrete-time Markov chains, enabling the modeling of indirect attention propagation and introducing TokenRank for measuring global token importance, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation and improved image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous attention studies only model immediate effects and lack a unified framework for understanding attention operations like selection, summation, and averaging. There's a need to better understand how tokens are attended in modern visual transformers and to capture indirect attention relationships beyond direct connections.

Method: The authors reinterpret the attention matrix as a discrete-time Markov chain, allowing modeling of indirect attention propagation. They identify metastable states corresponding to semantically similar regions using simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis. They also define TokenRank as the steady state vector of the Markov chain to measure global token importance.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot segmentation using lightweight computational tools. TokenRank demonstrates improvements in unconditional image generation tasks. The framework successfully unifies common attention operations and reveals how attention clusters in semantically similar regions while dispersing noisy scores.

Conclusion: The Markov chain interpretation of attention matrices provides a fresh and unified framework for understanding token attention in visual transformers. The approach offers both theoretical insights into attention mechanisms and practical improvements in computer vision tasks, demonstrating the value of viewing attention through the lens of probabilistic state transitions.

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

*Junjie Wang,Yunhan Tang,Yijie Wang,Zhihao Yuan,Huan Wang,Yangfan He,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synergos-VQA introduces a novel synergistic reasoning framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering that combines three complementary evidence streams (holistic, structural, and causal) to overcome MLLMs' limitation of relying on uni-dimensional evidence, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering are fundamentally bottlenecked by their reliance on uni-dimensional evidence, adopting a "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach that prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding and comprehensive reasoning.

Method: Synergos-VQA framework concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure robustly grounded reasoning.

Result: Synergos-VQA establishes new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities by significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs, and proves that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

Conclusion: The synergistic fusion of multi-faceted evidence (holistic, structural, and causal) enables more comprehensive and reliable reasoning in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering, showing that methodological innovation can achieve superior performance compared to simply scaling model size.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

*Xuzhi Wang,Xinran Wu,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Ziping Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MonoMRN, a two-stage framework for Monocular Semantic Scene Completion that decomposes the task into coarse MSSC and refinement using a Masked Recurrent Network with MS-GRU, achieving state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage MSSC methods achieve suboptimal performance due to simultaneously handling visible region segmentation and occluded region hallucination while being affected by inaccurate depth estimation, particularly struggling in complex scenes.

Method: A two-stage framework decomposing MSSC into: (1) coarse MSSC stage, and (2) refinement using Masked Recurrent Network with Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU) that focuses on occupied regions through mask updating mechanism and sparse design for computational efficiency, plus distance attention projection to reduce projection errors.

Result: MonoMRN achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and SemanticKITTI datasets for both indoor and outdoor scenes, with demonstrated robustness under various disturbances through comprehensive analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage MonoMRN framework effectively addresses MSSC challenges by separating coarse completion from refinement, with the Masked Recurrent Network significantly enhancing model resilience and performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

*Lingdong Kong,Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Rong Li,Yuhao Dong,Tianshuai Hu,Lai Xing Ng,Wei Tsang Ooi,Benoit R. Cottereau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding in event cameras, along with EventRefer, an attribute-aware framework that uses a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts to connect asynchronous event streams with human language for dynamic scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide microsecond-level latency and motion blur robustness ideal for dynamic environments, but connecting these asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. There's a need for bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning in event-based perception with natural language understanding.

Method: The authors propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding framework that uses a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE) to dynamically fuse multi-attribute representations. The method incorporates four grounding attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to other objects, and adapts to different modalities and scene dynamics.

Result: EventRefer achieves consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines across event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. The Talk2Event dataset provides over 30,000 validated referring expressions built from real-world driving data, enriched with four grounding attributes for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The Talk2Event dataset and EventRefer approach establish a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and autonomy applications, successfully bridging the gap between event camera data and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,

exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different

### [92] [BetterCheck: Towards Safeguarding VLMs for Automotive Perception Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17722)
*Malsha Ashani Mahawatta Dona,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Yinan Yu,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates vision language models (VLMs) for automotive perception systems, finding that while they show impressive traffic understanding capabilities, they suffer from hallucinations that could be dangerous for autonomous driving, and proposes BetterCheck as a hallucination detection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current specialized neural networks like YOLO have limited vocabularies for object detection, while VLMs show promising performance in understanding complex traffic situations. However, VLMs are prone to hallucinations (missing or fabricating traffic agents), which could lead to disastrous decisions in autonomous driving systems, necessitating systematic assessment and safety guardrails.

Method: Systematic assessment of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations from the Waymo Open Dataset to evaluate their performance and identify hallucination patterns. The authors propose BetterCheck as a hallucination detection strategy for VLM-supported perception systems.

Result: VLMs demonstrate remarkable image understanding capabilities and attention to fine details that are sometimes difficult for humans to spot. However, both proprietary and open VLMs still exhibit hallucination problems, making up elements in their descriptions of traffic scenes.

Conclusion: While VLMs show impressive potential for automotive perception systems due to their superior understanding of complex traffic situations compared to specialized networks, they require hallucination detection strategies like BetterCheck to ensure safety in autonomous driving applications due to their tendency to fabricate or miss critical traffic elements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for large-scale study of how facial filters from social media apps affect automated face recognition, demonstrating cross-cultural differences and proposing methods to detect and restore filtering effects to improve recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on facial filters' impact on face recognition were limited to small numbers of hand-picked filters in specific styles, failing to capture the wide range of filters available across various social media applications and their diverse effects on automated recognition systems.

Method: The authors developed a comprehensive framework consisting of: (1) a controlled dataset of face images, (2) a principled filter selection process to choose representative filters for experimentation, and (3) systematic experiments to evaluate filters' impact on recognition performance across different cultural contexts.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated cross-cultural differences in filtering effects through a case study comparing filters from American applications (Instagram and Snapchat) with Chinese applications (Meitu and Pitu). The study revealed that filtering effects can be detected in face embedding spaces.

Conclusion: Facial filters significantly impact automated face recognition performance, with notable cross-cultural variations. However, these filtering effects can be detected and restored in face embedding spaces, leading to improved recognition performance and providing a practical solution for mitigating filter-induced recognition degradation.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise

*Yiwen Chen,Zhihao Li,Yikai Wang,Hu Zhang,Qin Li,Chi Zhang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra3D is an efficient 3D generation framework that accelerates sparse voxel modeling by using VecSet representation for coarse layout generation and Part Attention mechanism for localized feature refinement, achieving 6.7x speed-up while maintaining high visual quality at 1024³ resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse voxel 3D generation frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in two-stage diffusion pipelines, limiting their practical application despite producing high-quality results.

Method: The method uses a two-stage approach: (1) VecSet representation for efficient coarse object layout generation with reduced token count, and (2) Part Attention - a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts computation within semantically consistent part regions. A scalable part annotation pipeline converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels to support this framework.

Result: Ultra3D achieves up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation, supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024³ resolution, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Ultra3D successfully addresses computational bottlenecks in sparse voxel 3D generation by introducing efficient representations and localized attention mechanisms, enabling practical high-resolution 3D content generation without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.
