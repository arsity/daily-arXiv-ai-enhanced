In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation.

Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates.

While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T.

To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval.
