Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis.

Traditional methods relying on\nhardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,\nand environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world\nscenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising\nalternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to\neither the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific\nand small-scale datasets.
