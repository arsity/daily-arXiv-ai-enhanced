To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first\nbenchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A\nsurprising \"aha moment\" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL\nprogresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while\nthe decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these\nintricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAE framework unifies multimodal learning by treating image understanding as encoding (I2T) and generation as decoding (T2I), using reconstruction fidelity as training objective with RL-based Unified-GRPO approach.", "motivation": "To create a unified multimodal learning framework that establishes coherent bidirectional information flow between image understanding and generation processes for mutual gains.", "method": "Proposes UAE framework with: 1) Pre-training decoder with long-context image captions, 2) Unified-GRPO RL approach with three stages: cold-start initialization, generation for understanding, and understanding for generation.", "result": "Encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions while decoder demonstrates improved ability to understand intricate descriptions, resulting in high-fidelity reconstructions.", "conclusion": "The framework successfully unifies multimodal learning, showing that reconstruction fidelity as training objective enables mutual improvement in both understanding and generation capabilities."}}

Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets.
