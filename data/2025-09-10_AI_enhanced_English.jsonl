In this paper, we present\nVIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization\nstrategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of\npre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying\nour framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction\nfor the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIRAL is a visual representation alignment method that improves MLLMs' performance on vision-centric tasks by aligning internal visual representations with pre-trained vision foundation models, preserving fine-grained visual details.", "motivation": "Current MLLMs underperform on vision-centric tasks like object counting and spatial reasoning due to text-only supervision, which causes loss of fine-grained visual details during training.", "method": "Proposes VIRAL - a regularization strategy that aligns MLLMs' internal visual representations with those of pre-trained vision foundation models to retain critical visual details and complement additional visual knowledge.", "result": "Shows consistent improvements across all tasks on multimodal benchmarks and validates key design choices through comprehensive ablation studies.", "conclusion": "This simple alignment approach opens an important direction for effective visual information integration in MLLM training, enhancing complex visual reasoning capabilities."}}
