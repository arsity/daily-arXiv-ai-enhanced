### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMoE, a Multi-level Mixture of Experts model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL), addressing mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL approaches lack solutions for mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, limiting performance.

Method: MMoE includes description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and intra/inter-level mixture of experts for dynamic feature selection.

Result: MMoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MMoE effectively addresses key MEL challenges and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPT, a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation, leveraging domain-agnostic text embeddings to improve domain-invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA methods for segmentation lack utilization of domain-agnostic text properties, despite advances in vision-language representation learning.

Method: CoPT uses LLM-generated domain descriptions and CLIP embeddings to create domain-invariant features via a covariance-based loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four UDA segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoPT effectively leverages text embeddings to enhance UDA for segmentation, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework to test the robustness of unlearned image generation models (IGMs), revealing vulnerabilities in current unlearning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical, legal, and societal concerns of IGMs by evaluating the robustness of machine unlearning (MU) methods against adversarial inputs.

Method: Proposes Recall, a framework optimizing adversarial image prompts using multi-modal conditioning in diffusion models, tested across ten unlearning methods.

Result: Recall outperforms baselines in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity, exposing vulnerabilities in unlearning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust unlearning solutions to ensure the safety of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

### [4] [Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07148)
*Getamesay Haile Dagnaw,Yanming Zhu,Muhammad Hassan Maqsood,Wencheng Yang,Xingshuai Dong,Xuefei Yin,Alan Wee-Chung Liew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on explainable AI (XAI) in biomedical image analysis, addressing gaps in modality-aware perspectives, multimodal learning, and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency, trust, and clinical adoption of deep learning models in biomedical imaging by providing a structured synthesis of XAI methods.

Method: Systematic categorization of XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy, and examining multimodal and vision-language paradigms.

Result: A detailed analysis of XAI principles, strengths, limitations, and evaluation metrics, with insights into emerging trends.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for advancing interpretable deep learning in biomedical image analysis, addressing challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to modality conflicts, introduces a dataset (MMMC) to study this, and evaluates three methods (prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) to mitigate it. Reinforcement learning performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address hallucinations in MLLMs caused by inherent conflicts between input modalities, a less-studied issue compared to model-response conflicts.

Method: Defines modality conflict, constructs the MMMC dataset, and tests three mitigation methods: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperforms others in reducing hallucinations; supervised fine-tuning is stable and promising.

Conclusion: Highlights modality conflict as a key cause of hallucinations and offers insights for improving MLLM robustness.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments using UAVs, combining YOLOv8 for detection, feature matching, and hue histogram analysis for identification, validated in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous identification of vessels without GNSS is crucial for applications like search and rescue and threat detection, especially when visual cues are the only available information.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for vessel detection, feature matching, and hue histogram distance analysis for target identification, followed by geometric localization.

Result: Demonstrated in real-world experiments during MBZIRC2023, showing effectiveness in GNSS-denied navigation. Evaluated detection accuracy and localization precision against an oracle approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method is viable for autonomous maritime surveillance in GNSS-denied environments, with practical validation and comparative analysis.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp is a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network that improves feature extraction and segmentation performance without needing extra labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods rely on additional labeled data or task similarity, limiting generalizability. CL-Polyp addresses this by using self-supervised contrastive learning.

Method: The method uses contrastive learning to enhance feature extraction and introduces two modules: MASPP for multi-scale feature fusion and CA for boundary reconstruction.

Result: CL-Polyp outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets, improving IoU by 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp is effective for clinical polyp segmentation, offering improved performance without additional annotations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel EEG-to-image model uses semantic captions and contrastive learning to achieve state-of-the-art visual decoding, aligning with neurocognitive pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome EEG's spatial limitations for image reconstruction by leveraging semantic captions and interpretable AI.

Method: Aligns EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions using a transformer-based encoder and contrastive learning. Caption embeddings condition a latent diffusion model for image generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding on EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways and semantic topography.

Conclusion: Structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG, advancing neuroscience and AI interpretability.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

### [9] [A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures, Consistency, and Cinematic Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07202)
*Mohamed Elmoghany,Ryan Rossi,Seunghyun Yoon,Subhojyoti Mukherjee,Eslam Bakr,Puneet Mathur,Gang Wu,Viet Dac Lai,Nedim Lipka,Ruiyi Zhang,Varun Manjunatha,Chien Nguyen,Daksh Dangi,Abel Salinas,Mohammad Taesiri,Hongjie Chen,Xiaolei Huang,Joe Barrow,Nesreen Ahmed,Hoda Eldardiry,Namyong Park,Yu Wang,Jaemin Cho,Anh Totti Nguyen,Zhengzhong Tu,Thien Nguyen,Dinesh Manocha,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Franck Dernoncourt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A review of video generative models highlights limitations in producing long-form videos with consistent character appearances and scene layouts, and proposes a taxonomy of methods to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in generating long-form videos (beyond 16 seconds) with consistent character appearances, scene layouts, and motion coherence, which current state-of-the-art methods struggle with.

Method: The study involves a comprehensive analysis of 32 papers on video generation, identifying key architectural components and training strategies. A taxonomy of methods is constructed, and comparative tables categorize papers by design and performance.

Result: The analysis reveals gaps in current methods, such as frame redundancy and low temporal diversity in longer videos, and identifies strategies for improving narrative coherence and high-fidelity detail.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a structured taxonomy and comparative framework to guide future research in generating consistent, high-quality long-form videos.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSCI is a lightweight, annotation-free method using color to mitigate appearance bias in CC-ReID, improving performance without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to reliance on additional models or annotations. CSCI explores color as a proxy for clothing-invariant features.

Method: Proposes CSCI, an RGB-only method using foreground/background colors. Introduces S2A self-attention to separate color and identity cues.

Result: Improves Top-1 accuracy by 2.9% on LTCC, 5.0% on PRCC (image), and 1.0% on CCVID, 2.5% on MeVID (video). Validates color as an effective proxy.

Conclusion: Color is a cost-effective solution for appearance bias in CC-ReID, demonstrated by CSCI's performance gains without additional supervision.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

*Johannes Merz,Lucien Fostier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated video segmentation pipeline for VFX production uses ML to generate temporally consistent masks, reducing manual effort and speeding up composites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow, resource-intensive mask generation in VFX production needs improvement.

Method: Uses ML for object detection via text prompts, per-frame segmentation, and video tracking for temporal stability.

Result: Reduced manual effort, faster preliminary composites, and enhanced VFX production efficiency.

Conclusion: The pipeline improves VFX workflow by automating mask generation with ML.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal language-guided framework, DisenQ, disentangles biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features using structured textual supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on activity-based video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person identification struggles with identity cues entangled in motion and appearance variations. Additional visual data like pose/silhouette often suffer from extraction inaccuracies.

Method: Proposed DisenQ, a unified querying transformer leveraging structured language guidance to disentangle features, ensuring identity cues remain independent.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrated strong generalization on traditional video-based identification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses activity-biometrics challenges by replacing visual data reliance with textual supervision, ensuring robust identification.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

### [13] [LinguaMark: Do Multimodal Models Speak Fairly? A Benchmark-Based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07274)
*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark is introduced as a multilingual benchmark for evaluating Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on Visual Question Answering (VQA), revealing performance disparities and biases across languages and social attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on multilingual capabilities in LMMs and the resulting biases, LinguaMark is developed to evaluate models fairly across languages.

Method: A dataset of 6,875 image-text pairs in 11 languages and five social attributes is used to evaluate LMMs on Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness metrics.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) perform best overall, while open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) show competitive performance, with Qwen2.5 excelling in multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: LinguaMark highlights the need for multilingual evaluation in LMMs and provides a benchmark for future research, with released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

### [14] [MagiC: Evaluating Multimodal Cognition Toward Grounded Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07297)
*Chengfei Wu,Ronald Seoh,Bingxuan Li,Liqiang Zhang,Fengrong Han,Dan Goldwasser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagiC is a benchmark evaluating grounded multimodal cognition in vision-language models, assessing accuracy, reasoning, and visual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models genuinely perform visual reasoning or rely on biases, MagiC provides a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: MagiC includes 5,500 weakly supervised and 900 human-curated QA examples, evaluating 15 models across correctness, reasoning, grounding, and self-correction.

Result: Analysis reveals limitations in current models' grounded reasoning, with new metrics (MagiScore, StepSense) introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: MagiC highlights gaps in visual reasoning and offers insights for improving model robustness and introspection.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

### [15] [ADIEE: Automatic Dataset Creation and Scorer for Instruction-Guided Image Editing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07317)
*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE introduces an automated dataset creation method to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation, outperforming existing models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of effective automated evaluation tools for instruction-guided image editing, with open-source models struggling in alignment and proprietary models lacking transparency and cost efficiency, drives the need for ADIEE.

Method: ADIEE generates a large-scale dataset (100K+ samples) to fine-tune a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model, decoding numeric scores from a custom token.

Result: The scorer outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, improving score correlation with human ratings by 17.24% and pair-wise comparison accuracy by up to 9.35%. It also boosts MagicBrush's evaluation score by 8.98%.

Conclusion: ADIEE provides a transparent, cost-efficient solution for automated evaluation of instruction-guided image editing, significantly improving performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contrastive reinforcement learning method to improve entity identity consistency in visual storytelling, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling systems often fail to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to incoherent references.

Method: A contrastive reinforcement learning approach is proposed, using synthetic negative examples and a dual-component reward function for fine-tuning.

Result: Improvements include grounding mAP (+14.8%), F1 (+17.1%), and cross-frame entity persistence (+13.7%).

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances entity grounding and consistency in visual storytelling.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC is a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion, leveraging pseudo geometries and scale manipulation to enhance data diversity with minimal annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable depth completion models requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are labor-intensive to collect. PacGDC addresses this by reducing annotation effort while enhancing data diversity.

Method: PacGDC synthesizes pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales of depth maps using multiple depth foundation models. It incorporates interpolation, relocation, and unlabeled images to diversify geometries.

Result: PacGDC achieves strong generalizability across benchmarks, performing well in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PacGDC offers a scalable and efficient solution for generalizable depth completion, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

### [19] [Adaptive Particle-Based Shape Modeling for Anatomical Surface Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07379)
*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSM improves shape variability quantification by using self-adaptive particle configurations with novel neighborhood and geodesic correspondence mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PSM methods lack self-adaptivity to local geometric features, limiting accuracy in representing complex anatomical variability.

Method: Introduces two mechanisms: (1) neighborhood correspondence loss for adaptivity and (2) geodesic correspondence algorithm for consistency.

Result: Evaluated on challenging datasets, showing improved adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances PSM by balancing adaptivity and consistency, improving anatomical shape representation.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSAGSM, a lightweight module for Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos, enhancing temporal and spatial modeling. It also presents the TTA dataset for table tennis PES.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability, limiting their performance.

Method: Proposes MSAGSM, combining multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention to improve GSM. Introduces the TTA dataset for benchmarking.

Result: MSAGSM consistently outperforms existing methods with minimal overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: MSAGSM is an effective, plug-and-play solution for PES, and the TTA dataset advances research in table tennis event spotting.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-category animal motion transfer preserves habitual behaviors, using a habit-preservation module and LLM for unobserved species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion transfer methods focus on humans, neglecting animal habitual behaviors, which are crucial for realistic animation and VR.

Method: Proposes a generative framework with a habit-preservation module and category-specific habit encoder, enhanced by an LLM for unobserved species.

Result: Validated on the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, the model outperforms existing methods in preserving habitual motion.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in animal motion transfer, preserving species-specific habits effectively.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

*Yongtang Bao,Chengjie Tang,Yuze Wang,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-Wild is an interactive segmentation method for unconstrained photo collections, addressing inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions using 3D Gaussian Splatting and multi-dimensional feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconstrained photo collections are easier to obtain but suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions, making segmentation challenging. Existing methods fail to address these issues.

Method: Seg-Wild integrates multi-dimensional feature embeddings with 3D Gaussian Splatting and uses the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth anomalies. Segmentation is achieved by projecting 3D Gaussians onto 2D planes and using SAM masks.

Result: Seg-Wild outperforms previous methods in segmentation and reconstruction quality for in-the-wild scenes.

Conclusion: Seg-Wild provides a robust solution for segmenting and reconstructing scenes from unconstrained photo collections, with superior performance demonstrated in experiments.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis with amodal completion, outperforming existing multi-stage methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis and amodal completion are multi-stage, inefficient, and ignore cross-view dependencies. EscherNet++ aims to address these limitations with an end-to-end approach.

Method: Uses masked fine-tuning (input-level and feature-level masking) to enable end-to-end novel view synthesis and amodal completion. Integrates with feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: PSNR improved by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks. Reduces reconstruction time by 95%.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ is scalable, efficient, and generalizes well to real-world occluded reconstruction, setting new benchmarks in performance.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

*Xinyao Yu,Hao Sun,Zeyu Ling,Ziwei Niu,Zhenjia Bai,Rui Qin,Yen-Wei Chen,Lanfen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC is a prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy for text-image classification, reducing computational costs and trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) are computationally expensive to fine-tune, prompting the need for efficient interaction strategies.

Method: EPIC uses temporal prompts on intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction to align modalities efficiently.

Result: Achieves reduced resource consumption (1% of foundation model parameters) and superior performance on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE, comparable on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC offers an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LMMs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source MLLMs lack robust reasoning for complex tasks, prompting the development of Corvid to address these limitations.

Method: Corvid uses a hybrid vision encoder, GateMixer for cross-modal alignment, and is trained with a two-stage CoT approach using the MCoT-Instruct-287K dataset. Inference-time scaling with self-verification mitigates reasoning errors.

Result: Corvid surpasses similar-scale MLLMs, excelling in mathematical and scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: Corvid advances MLLM reasoning capabilities, offering a scalable solution for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSANet improves ultrasound video segmentation by enhancing noise robustness through dual semantic-aware modules (AFSA and LGSA), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging's noise challenges hinder automated lesion/organ segmentation, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: DSANet uses AFSA for adjacent-frame feature fusion and LGSA to integrate local and global features, avoiding pixel-level dependencies.

Result: DSANet achieves higher segmentation accuracy and inference speed (FPS) than existing methods.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively addresses noise in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Motivation: Melanoma is deadly, and BWV is a key diagnostic feature, but limited research exists on detecting BWV in dermatological images.

Method: Uses a non-annotated dataset converted to annotated via color threshold techniques. A custom DCNN is trained on multiple datasets with custom layers.

Result: High testing accuracy: 85.71% (PH2), 95.00% (ISIC), 95.05% (combined), 90.00% (Derm7pt). XAI improves interpretability.

Conclusion: The DCNN with XAI outperforms existing models, offering a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Conclusion: Objectomaly effectively refines OoD segmentation by incorporating object-level priors and boundary precision, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive

TL;DR: A novel GAN-based blind face image restoration framework with local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE) outperforms existing methods in adverse weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather degrades image quality, reducing face recognition accuracy. Current FIR models lack modules addressing weather-induced degradations, leading to distorted textures and structures.

Method: Proposes a GAN-based blind FIR framework with SFFT for local statistical alignment and DAFE for robust feature extraction under adverse weather.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion-based FIR methods, improving texture and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: The SFFT and DAFE modules enhance face restoration in challenging weather, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) to protect video data privacy in Visual Object Tracking (VOT), addressing inefficiencies and limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent unauthorized use of personal video data in training commercial VOT models, as current methods are ineffective for videos.

Method: Proposes a novel generative framework for TUEs, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt tracker learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across models and datasets.

Conclusion: The TUE framework effectively safeguards video data privacy in VOT, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Xinyuan Chang,Xinran Liu,Zheng Pan,Mu Xu,Ding Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Map Association (OMA), a benchmark for associating global SD maps with online HD maps to enhance autonomous vehicle navigation, along with a baseline method called Map Association Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with integrating global SD maps and online HD maps for hybrid navigation, limiting their planning capabilities.

Method: Proposes the OMA benchmark with 480k roads and 260k lane paths, and introduces the Map Association Transformer framework using path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: OMA provides metrics for evaluating model performance, and the proposed framework improves understanding of geometric and topological correspondences.

Conclusion: OMA and the Map Association Transformer address the gap in hybrid navigation, enhancing autonomous vehicle planning.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

TL;DR: DMPO introduces a novel method for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by minimizing reverse KL divergence, outperforming existing techniques by 64.6% in PickScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal mean-seeking optimization in existing preference alignment methods for diffusion models.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO) minimizes reverse KL divergence, aligning with original RL optimization direction.

Result: DMPO outperforms all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across datasets.

Conclusion: DMPO provides a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment in diffusion models, bridging theory and practical performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion introduces a group graph dynamics-kinematics network to model human motion by leveraging physical dependencies between joints, improving realism and performance in motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect intrinsic physical dependencies in human motion, leading to unrealistic results and increased learning difficulty.

Method: GGMotion uses a group graph network with radial fields, inter/intra-group interaction modules, and equivariant MLPs to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and update joint features.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, achieving superior short-term motion prediction.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively models human motion by incorporating physical priors, enhancing realism and performance.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled data in this field. It includes 17 scenes with 7830 RGB images and segmentation masks, and proposes evaluation metrics and a baseline method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of extensive, accurately labeled multi-view video datasets hinders progress in 4D object segmentation for dynamic scenes. MUVOD aims to fill this gap.

Method: The dataset (MUVOD) is compiled from 17 diverse scenes with 9-46 views each, providing 7830 RGB images and segmentation masks for 4D motion tracking. A baseline segmentation approach and evaluation metric are also introduced.

Result: MUVOD contains 459 instances of 73 categories, serving as a benchmark for multi-view video segmentation. A subset is also proposed for 3D object segmentation evaluation.

Conclusion: MUVOD provides a valuable resource for advancing 4D and 3D object segmentation research, with potential to drive progress in dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

### [37] [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521)
*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spline-based trajectory representation to address challenges in dense point trajectory modeling, improving spatial coherence and temporal interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for trajectory modeling either rely on opaque neural networks or heuristic-based explicit techniques, lacking spatial coherence and under-exploring implicit representations for sparse temporal signals.

Method: A spline-based trajectory representation with explicit knot degrees of freedom is introduced, along with a low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for knot characteristics.

Result: The method outperforms in temporal interpolation and achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction while enhancing motion coherence.

Conclusion: The spline-based approach offers a more intuitive and efficient solution for trajectory modeling, preserving spatial coherence and improving interpolation.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX introduces a remote sensing foundation model using mixture-of-modality experts to address modality mismatch and fine-tuning challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing foundation models focus on specific modalities, causing a mismatch with application needs and making fine-tuning expensive.

Method: MAPEX uses a modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and modality-aware pruning to create efficient, task-specific models.

Result: MAPEX shows strong performance on diverse remote sensing datasets compared to supervised training and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MAPEX effectively addresses modality mismatch and fine-tuning inefficiencies, offering a scalable solution for remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [39] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'linear reasoning bottleneck' in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and introduces the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) to measure it. It shows the bottleneck stems from reasoning failures, not perception, and proposes task-dependent solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the limitations of VLMs in abstract reasoning tasks, particularly the 'linear reasoning bottleneck' caused by misaligned reasoning pathways.

Method: Introduces the LSC metric, uses postfix tuning as a control, and explores interventions like activating existing pathways or adapting core weights.

Result: Finds dormant reasoning pathways in VLMs but notes complex tasks require deeper adaptation. Improved representation can fail on new prompts despite good separability.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs requires targeted alignment, not just better representation learning, offering a new analytical lens for VLM performance.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

TL;DR: Proposes DGKD-WLSS, a framework combining Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation and Depth-Guided Feature Fusion to improve weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods perform poorly in low-light due to image degradation and weak supervision constraints, leading to unreliable class activation maps and ambiguous pseudo-labels.

Method: Uses DGKD for feature alignment via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation, and DGF2 to integrate depth maps as illumination-invariant priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under low-light.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS effectively addresses low-light challenges, enhancing feature learning and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Method: Uses hierarchical adapter modules, shared subspace projection, MTL Decoder, and Sinkhorn-K-means clustering for anomaly scoring.

Result: Achieves 97.5% AUC, 70.4% AP, and 95.2% PRO on MVTec AD, outperforming recent models.

Conclusion: NexViTAD marks a transformative advance in cross-domain defect detection with superior performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOTA is a multi-scale inference strategy for 3D flood mapping, improving accuracy and coverage without retraining, achieving 84% IoU and <0.5m boundary error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flood mapping products lack spatial detail or ignore depth, hindering disaster response.

Method: HOTA uses overlapping tiles on Sentinel-2 images with SegFormer and a DEM-based depth module for 3D mapping.

Result: Improved IoU from 73% to 84% and mean boundary error <0.5m in Kempsey flood case.

Conclusion: HOTA enables accurate, large-scale 3D flood mapping for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 is a diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework, the first to use multi-view diffusion models for high-fidelity, view-consistent hair transfer. It introduces a multi-view training pipeline and achieves superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods lack consistency in multi-view hair generation, which is critical for applications like digital humans. Stable-Hair v2 addresses this gap.

Method: The framework uses a multi-view training pipeline with a Bald Converter, inpainting model, and face-finetuned diffusion model. It integrates polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention for smooth transitions.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques, delivering detailed, realistic, and view-consistent hairstyle transfers.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 sets a new benchmark for multi-view hair transfer, with publicly available code for further research.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LOSC, a method for open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans, outperforms SOTA by refining noisy image-based labels and training a 3D network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy and sparse labels from image-based VLMs in 3D point clouds for driving scenarios.

Method: Consolidate labels for spatio-temporal consistency and robustness, then train a 3D network (LOSC).

Result: Outperforms SOTA in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: LOSC is a simple yet effective method for improving segmentation accuracy in lidar scans.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing performance gaps and unexpected behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for spatial visualization in MLLMs are inadequate, often overlapping with training data and lacking reliability.

Method: SpatialViz-Bench includes 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities with 1,180 problems, tested on 33 MLLMs.

Result: Wide performance variations, unexpected model behaviors, and deficiencies in spatial visualization were uncovered.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights MLLMs' shortcomings in spatial visualization, filling a gap in the field.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLU is a new framework for uncertainty quantification in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that integrates visual and textual embeddings to predict failure, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in VLMs, which remains an open problem.

Method: ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation using visual and textual embeddings, training a binary classifier for uncertainty prediction.

Result: ViLU achieves significant improvements over existing methods on datasets like ImageNet-1k, CC12M, and LAION-400M.

Conclusion: ViLU's architecture and training approach are critical for effective uncertainty quantification, and the method is suitable for post-hoc settings.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-GVC is a novel generative video coding framework using trajectory-guided motion sampling and diffusion processes for ultra-low bitrate scenarios, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods are limited by domain specificity or reliance on high-level text guidance, leading to unrealistic reconstructions.

Method: T-GVC uses semantic-aware sparse motion sampling and trajectory-aligned loss constraints in diffusion processes for motion control.

Result: T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and end-to-end methods in ultra-low bitrate conditions and achieves precise motion control.

Conclusion: T-GVC introduces a new direction for generative video coding by combining geometric motion modeling with generative priors.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

*F. Xavier Gaya-Morey,Julia Sanchez-Perez,Cristina Manresa-Yee,Jose M. Buades-Rubio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies age-related bias in deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, particularly for the elderly, and proposes three mitigation strategies to improve fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep FER models exhibit demographic biases, especially in age, compromising fairness and reliability. The study focuses on elderly populations to address these disparities.

Method: The study investigates performance disparities across age groups, uses Explainable AI (XAI) to analyze biases, and evaluates three strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Models are trained on AffectNet with age labels and validated on balanced datasets.

Result: The proposed strategies improve recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for expressions like "neutral", "sadness", and "anger". Saliency heatmaps show more relevant facial region attention.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be mitigated with simple training modifications, and approximate demographic labels enhance fairness in affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

*Fengqian Pang,Chunyue Lei,Hongfei Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Zhiqiang Xing,Huafeng Wang,Chuyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolCLIP combines cell video and molecular data to improve drug MoA recognition, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for MoA recognition focus on spatial cell images but ignore temporal dynamics and molecular data, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes MolCLIP, a visual language model integrating microscopic cell videos and molecular data, using a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and metric learning.

Result: Achieves 51.2% and 20.5% improvements in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition on MitoDataset.

Conclusion: MolCLIP effectively leverages temporal dynamics and molecular data, enhancing MoA recognition performance.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model for efficient and accurate keypoint annotation in cervical vertebral maturation analysis, aiding growth potential prediction in pediatric orthodontics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate growth potential estimation is crucial for effective orthodontic treatment, but manual keypoint annotation is labor-intensive.

Method: ARNet, a user-interactive deep learning model, uses an Interaction-guided recalibration network and morphology-aware loss to streamline keypoint annotation.

Result: ARNet reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and performs well across datasets, proving its applicability in medical imaging.

Conclusion: The research provides an AI-assisted tool for growth potential assessment, advancing pediatric orthodontics.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

*Feng Liu,Lingna Gu,Chen Shi,Xiaolan Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, an AU-enhanced dynamic facial expression recognition architecture that integrates AU-expression knowledge to improve deep learning models, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating quantified AU-expression knowledge and addressing data label imbalance issues.

Method: Designs a weight matrix for AU-expression knowledge, integrates it with deep learning outcomes via AU loss, and validates it on existing models.

Result: AU-DFER outperforms SOTA methods without extra computation and improves results. Also addresses label imbalance with redesigned loss functions.

Conclusion: Integrating AU knowledge and addressing data imbalance significantly enhances DFER, highlighting the importance of these strategies in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationale-enhanced decoding (RED) to improve multi-modal reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by addressing the issue of ignored rationales in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore generated rationales in CoT reasoning, undermining grounding and accuracy.

Method: Reformulates CoT as KL-constrained reward maximization and proposes RED, a decoding strategy that harmonizes visual and rationale information.

Result: RED consistently outperforms standard CoT and other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs.

Conclusion: RED enhances the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning, advancing reliable multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Mamba, a novel method for underwater monocular depth estimation (UMDE) using a tree-aware scanning strategy and a new benchmark dataset (BlueDepth).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods fail in UMDE due to inflexible state scanning and unreliable depth labels in existing datasets.

Method: Proposes Tree-Mamba with a tree-aware scanning strategy for adaptive feature aggregation and constructs the BlueDepth dataset with reliable labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperforms leading methods in accuracy and efficiency, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba and BlueDepth address key challenges in UMDE, offering improved performance and a reliable benchmark.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to address local motion blur in images by using a trainable mask predictor and an intra-frame motion analyzer, optimizing computation and improving blur restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring methods struggle with inefficient resource allocation and handling spatially varying blur patterns.

Method: Proposes a trainable mask predictor to identify blurred regions and an intra-frame motion analyzer for adaptive blur restoration, with structural reparameterization for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on local and global blur datasets, reducing FLOPs by 49%.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses local motion blur with computational efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security challenges in unified VLMs where adversarial inputs must remain effective across unpredictable task instructions.

Method: Introduces CrossVLAD dataset (from MSCOCO with GPT-4 annotations) and CRAFT, a region-based attack framework with token-alignment.

Result: CRAFT outperforms existing methods in cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates.

Conclusion: CRAFT effectively adversarially influences unified VLMs across diverse tasks, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Motivation: To investigate if dataset bias exists in medical imaging, given the sensitivity of medical data and the popularity of certain open-source datasets.

Method: Applied dataset transformations and tested multiple network architectures on NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest datasets.

Result: Highlights the need to determine if AI methods in medical imaging rely on shortcuts or focus on pathology.

Conclusion: Encourages explainable research and more open-source medical datasets, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A simplified 3D promptable segmentation method is introduced to address the limitations of SAM in handling 3D medical imaging, reducing inference time and complexity while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's 2D architecture is inadequate for 3D medical imaging (e.g., CT/MRI), and existing 3D methods are computationally expensive and complex.

Method: The proposed method, inspired by SegVol, simplifies 3D segmentation by eliminating sliding-window inference and prompt management complexities.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced inference time and computational resource usage.

Conclusion: The simplified 3D promptable segmentation method offers a practical solution for medical imaging, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based decoding method to reduce bias in 'Yes' answers and improve performance in vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the imbalance in 'Yes' ratios across VQA datasets and mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs for safer deployment.

Method: Energy-based decoding dynamically selects hidden states from layers with minimal energy scores.

Result: Improves accuracy by 4.82% and reduces yes-ratio bias by 8.81% across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method is simple, effective, and reduces bias while enhancing VLM performance.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

TL;DR: A two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) improves early human activity recognition with event-based vision sensors, outperforming previous methods by 2% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early recognition of human activities is vital for safety and responsiveness in human-robot/machine interfaces, but existing methods limit early prediction capabilities.

Method: A high-rate two-stream SNN processes event-based vision data for early predictions, benchmarked on the THU EACT-50 dataset.

Result: The SNN outperforms prior work by 2% in final accuracy and is tested for early recognition in sports motion capture.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN framework enhances early activity recognition, demonstrating practical impact in real-world tasks like sports motion capture.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDST, a sparse-dense side-tuning architecture for Video Temporal Grounding, improving adaptability and performance while reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting adaptability to new domains. Full fine-tuning is impractical, and existing side-tuning approaches overlook the sparse nature of Moment Retrieval.

Method: Proposes SDST, an anchor-free side-tuning architecture, and introduces Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention for better context modeling. Integrates InternVideo2 backbone into the framework.

Result: Significantly improves existing methods, achieving competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, with up to 73% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SDST effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering a parameter-efficient and high-performing solution for Video Temporal Grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

*Charlie Budd,Silvère Ségaud,Matthew Elliot,Graeme Stasiuk,Yijing Xie,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-RAFT improves fluorescence-guided neurosurgery by enabling cross-modal image correspondence between hyperspectral images under different lighting, reducing errors by 36.6% over a baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical decision-making with real-time quantitative fluorescence measurements in neurosurgery.

Method: Introduces X-RAFT, a modified RAFT optical flow model for cross-modal inputs, using distinct encoders and self-supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 36.6% error reduction over baseline and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively addresses cross-modal correspondence challenges in neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method improves geometric accuracy in additive manufacturing by comparing CAD and XCT volumes, outperforming traditional DVC methods with faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric inaccuracies in additive manufacturing (AM) components, caused by shrinkage and deformations, can affect performance and lifespan. Current methods like Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) face challenges in registration accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: A deep learning approach estimates voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes using dynamic patch-based processing. A Binary Difference Map (BDM) is introduced to evaluate registration accuracy alongside the Dice Score.

Result: The method achieves a 9.2% improvement in Dice Score and 9.9% in voxel match rate over classic DVC, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for deep learning-based DVC in AM, enabling more reliable and efficient manufacturing processes, which could save time and materials in industries like automotive, medical, and aerospace.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

### [64] [SCOOTER: A Human Evaluation Framework for Unrestricted Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07776)
*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOOTER is a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, providing guidelines, tools, and a benchmark dataset. It reveals that current attacks fail to create imperceptible images and highlights discrepancies between human and model perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses against adversarial attacks rely on norm-bounded constraints, but unrestricted attacks bypass these. There's a lack of statistically significant human evaluations for such attacks, necessitating a unified framework.

Method: Introduced SCOOTER, an open-source framework with best-practice guidelines for human evaluations, large-scale human vs. model comparisons, and software tools.

Result: Three color-space and three diffusion-based attacks failed to produce imperceptible images. GPT-4o detected adversarial examples inconsistently.

Conclusion: Automated vision systems don't align with human perception, underscoring the need for SCOOTER as a benchmark for unrestricted adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study on calibration techniques for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training methods, with practical guidelines for robust calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve calibration robustness under real-world dataset shifts for image classification tasks.

Method: Comparison of post-hoc calibration methods and in-training strategies (e.g., label smoothing) across eight classification tasks and natural shifts.

Result: Best calibration under shift comes from entropy regularization and label smoothing; OOD exposure improves robustness; ensembling and finetuning foundation models yield top results.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines for calibration under shift: prioritize entropy regularization, label smoothing, and ensembling, while balancing trade-offs between in-distribution and shifted calibration.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset for evaluating spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, addressing biases in existing datasets by excluding object names and focusing on spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks focus on spatial reasoning, with datasets often mixing semantic and spatial cues, leading to superficial model interpretations.

Method: The authors create S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with 200k+ vision-language pairs and 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries, designed to test spatial reasoning without object name shortcuts.

Result: Benchmarks show state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs struggle with the dataset, highlighting its necessity.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D and the 3D-SRS benchmark aim to advance spatially aware AI for embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network using 3D CNNs and a differential frame fusion module to improve heart rate measurement accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models lack accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: The method combines 3D CNNs, differential frame fusion, Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention, and a dynamic hybrid loss function.

Result: The model achieved a MAE of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates superior robustness and generalization, making it effective for rPPG signal extraction in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

### [68] [Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07796)
*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT introduces instance-aware prompts for vision transformers, outperforming conventional dataset-level prompts by balancing dataset and instance knowledge using PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VPT uses fixed dataset-level prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance due to dataset variance. ViaPT aims to address this by incorporating instance-specific information.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts for each input, fuses them with dataset-level prompts, and uses PCA to retain key information. It avoids the limitations of VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow.

Result: ViaPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 34 datasets, reducing learnable parameters while improving performance.

Conclusion: ViaPT establishes a new paradigm for optimizing visual prompts in vision transformers by effectively balancing dataset and instance-level knowledge.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergistic Prompting (SyP) to improve robustness in visual recognition with missing modalities, addressing limitations of static prompts and basic prompt-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling missing modalities in multi-modal models are inflexible and unreliable, especially when critical modalities are absent.

Method: Proposes SyP with a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to balance information across modalities.

Result: SyP outperforms existing methods on three datasets, showing robustness under varying missing rates.

Conclusion: SyP effectively addresses missing modality challenges, offering superior adaptability and reliability.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting, comparing patient-specific and multi-patient training strategies under clinical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is crucial for precise proton therapy, but current deep learning methods lack exploration of transformer architectures despite their success in trajectory forecasting.

Method: The study uses digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from 31 patients for training a multi-patient model and a patient-specific model for a 32nd patient. Both models predict tumor motion over a 1-second horizon, evaluated using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE).

Result: Patient-specific models outperformed multi-patient models on planning data but multi-patient models showed robustness to anatomical variability and performed comparably on treatment data without retraining.

Conclusion: Vision Transformers are effective for markerless tumor motion forecasting, with patient-specific models offering precision and multi-patient models providing robustness for clinical use.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates content-based puzzle solvers' robustness against corruptions like missing pieces and eroded edges, finding deep learning models, especially the Positional Diffusion model, adapt better than heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing puzzle solvers lack evaluation under realistic challenges like fragmented artefacts or shredded documents, prompting an investigation into their robustness.

Method: The study introduces three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions (missing pieces, eroded edges, eroded contents) and evaluates heuristic and deep learning-based solvers.

Result: Standard solvers decline rapidly with corruption, but deep learning models, particularly the Positional Diffusion model, improve robustness through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The findings suggest promising directions for enhancing automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts, emphasizing deep learning's adaptability.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCIS is a simple yet effective baseline for class-incremental/continual image segmentation (CIS), addressing plasticity loss and data order reliance by leveraging highly aggregated image features and introducing cross-stage consistency and visual query replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupled frameworks in CIS suffer from plasticity loss and heavy reliance on input data order, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: SimCIS directly selects image features for query assignment to ensure perfect alignment and introduces cross-stage consistency and a visual query-based replay mechanism.

Result: SimCIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS provides a powerful and simple baseline for CIS, effectively addressing key challenges while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale dataset for 3D anomaly detection in manufacturing, addressing the lack of realistic industrial datasets. It includes high-resolution scans, annotated defects, and machine features, captured in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects significantly impact manufacturing yield, but current datasets lack realism and quality, hindering the development of effective defect detection methods.

Method: The authors created 3D-ADAM, a dataset with 14,120 high-resolution scans, 27,346 annotated defects, and 8,110 machine feature annotations, captured in real industrial settings with varied conditions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on 3D-ADAM shows its challenging nature, highlighting gaps in current approaches. Expert validation confirms its industrial relevance.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM provides a robust benchmark to advance 3D anomaly detection, addressing real-world manufacturing needs.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Motivation: Progress in digital pathology is hard to assess due to many concurrent methods. A benchmark is needed to evaluate performance, differences, uncertainty, and robustness.

Method: THUNDER is introduced as a tile-level benchmark, supporting diverse datasets and tasks, and comparing 23 foundation models on 16 datasets.

Result: The benchmark provides insights into feature spaces, robustness, and uncertainty, supporting state-of-the-art and user-defined models.

Conclusion: THUNDER is a fast, dynamic, and easy-to-use tool for evaluating digital pathology models, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

*Jiayi Wu,Tianfu Wang,Md Abu Bakr Siddique,Md Jahidul Islam,Cornelia Fermuller,Yiannis Aloimonos,Christopher A. Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLURPP combines latent diffusion models and scene decomposition for efficient underwater image restoration, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater image restoration methods are computationally intensive and produce artifacts in complex scenes.

Method: SLURPP integrates pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition and uses a synthetic data pipeline for training.

Result: SLURPP is 200X faster and improves PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks, with better real-world performance.

Conclusion: SLURPP advances underwater image restoration by balancing efficiency and accuracy, validated by synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

*Jinhong Wang,Tajamul Ashraf,Zongyan Han,Jorma Laaksonen,Rao Mohammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA framework improves factual accuracy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic context adjustment and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually inconsistent responses in medical diagnosis, and traditional RAG methods face challenges like insufficient/excessive retrieval and over-reliance on retrieved data.

Method: MIRA includes a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module for dynamic context adjustment and a medical RAG framework with image embeddings and a query-rewrite module for multimodal reasoning.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks, enhancing factual accuracy.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively addresses RAG challenges in MLLMs, improving factual accuracy and performance in medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

*Mateusz Wasala,Mateusz Smolarczyk,Michal Danilowicz,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an embedded, unsupervised architecture for feature point detection and description, using a quantized SuperPoint CNN, optimized for resource-limited platforms like FPGAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate position estimation is crucial for autonomous navigation systems, requiring efficient feature extraction methods for VSLAM.

Method: Implemented a quantized SuperPoint CNN on an FPGA SoC (AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+), leveraging Brevitas and FINN for quantization and optimization.

Result: Achieved 54 fps for 640x480 images on FPGA, surpassing state-of-the-art solutions, with experiments on the TUM dataset validating performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method balances computational efficiency and detection quality, enabling effective deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy, CiCi, is proposed for rPPG tasks, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency in signals to enhance real-time adaptation without source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing domain adaptation methods in rPPG, addressing privacy and real-time constraints.

Method: Introduces the CiCi framework, combining consistency and inconsistency priors with gradient dynamic control for stable adaptation.

Result: Outperforms existing techniques on five datasets under TTA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CiCi enables effective real-time self-supervised adaptation for rPPG without needing source data.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time ID algorithm for mice in home cages improves tracking accuracy and reduces ID switches by combining custom ear tags, a multiple object tracker, a transformer-based ID classifier, and a tracklet associator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated monitoring of mice is challenging due to their dense housing, similar appearances, and high mobility, but it's crucial for accurate data collection and animal welfare.

Method: The pipeline includes MouseTracks (tracker), Mouseformer (ID classifier), and MouseMap (tracklet associator) to assign IDs at 30 fps.

Result: The method improves tracking efficiency and reduces ID switches across strains and environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The developed pipeline enables reliable, real-time mouse identification, enhancing research accuracy and animal welfare.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all

TL;DR: A framework for scaling vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos using reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of long video reasoning by integrating a large dataset, a two-stage training pipeline, and efficient infrastructure.

Method: Combines chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP) for efficient training.

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B outperforms benchmarks in temporal, spatial, and plot reasoning, with MR-SP achieving 2.1x speedup in training.

Conclusion: The framework advances long video reasoning in VLMs, with publicly released training infrastructure supporting diverse modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: A method for synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos using a data curation pipeline (M3arsSynth) and a terrain video generator (MarsGen), addressing data scarcity and domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality Martian landscape videos for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation, despite challenges like limited data and domain differences.

Method: Combines M3arsSynth (3D environment reconstruction from stereo images) and MarsGen (video synthesis from 3D data), leveraging NASA's PDS.

Result: Outperforms terrestrial dataset-trained models in visual fidelity and 3D consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively bridges the gap in Martian video synthesis, offering practical applications for space missions.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry Forcing improves video diffusion models by aligning their representations with 3D geometric features, enhancing visual quality and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models often lack geometric-aware structure, limiting their ability to represent the 3D world accurately.

Method: Proposes Geometry Forcing, using Angular and Scale Alignment to align diffusion model features with a pretrained geometric foundation model.

Result: Significant improvements in visual quality and 3D consistency in video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively bridges the gap between video diffusion models and 3D world representations.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Online Spatio-Temporal understanding in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in dynamic reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of real-world embodied perception, focusing on offline settings with fixed inputs. OST-Bench addresses this gap.

Method: OST-Bench uses 1.4k scenes and 10k QA pairs from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes to test MLLMs under online, dynamic conditions.

Result: Leading MLLMs struggle with complex spatio-temporal reasoning, showing declining accuracy as exploration and memory demands increase.

Conclusion: OST-Bench identifies key challenges in online embodied reasoning and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

### [85] [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985)
*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates why CLIP models fail to learn binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs) and identifies data properties like low attribute density and saliency bias as key issues. Scaling batch size or adding hard negatives doesn't help; only data with specific properties enables reliable binding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs), and prior fixes like hard negatives or architecture changes were insufficient. The authors hypothesize the root cause lies in data properties.

Method: The study uses a synthetic dataset to rigorously analyze how data properties (e.g., attribute density, caption completeness, saliency bias) affect CLIP's binding performance.

Result: Common natural data properties hinder binding. Neither batch size scaling nor hard negatives improve performance. Only data with specific properties (e.g., high attribute density, complete captions) enables reliable binding.

Conclusion: Data properties are critical for CLIP's binding ability. Future work should focus on curating or generating data with these properties to improve CLIP-like models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STTM is a training-free method for merging spatio-temporal tokens in video LLMs, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face quadratic computational scaling with token count, limiting efficiency. STTM addresses this by exploiting overlooked local redundancy in video data.

Method: STTM transforms frames into multi-granular spatial tokens via a quadtree search, then merges tokens temporally.

Result: STTM achieves 2× speed-up with 0.5% accuracy drop (50% token budget) and 3× speed-up with 2% drop (30% budget). It also enables KV cache reuse.

Conclusion: STTM efficiently reduces token count in video LLMs with minimal accuracy loss, offering practical speed-ups and reuse benefits.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASIC, a unified evaluation framework for brain visual decoding, addressing limitations of coarse metrics by focusing on structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding are inadequate due to coarse metrics, lack of neuroscientific foundation, and inability to capture fine-grained distinctions.

Method: BASIC uses hierarchical segmentation-based metrics for structural fidelity and multimodal large language models for semantic-level comparisons.

Result: The framework benchmarks diverse visual decoding methods, providing discriminative and interpretable evaluations.

Conclusion: BASIC offers a comprehensive, interpretable, and neuroscientifically grounded foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

TL;DR: A framework for few-shot keypoint detection using sketches addresses cross-modal embedding and user-specific sketch styles, achieving success in novel keypoints and classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in few-shot learning for keypoint detection when source data is unavailable from the same distribution as the query.

Method: Leverages sketches, a prototypical setup, grid-based locator, and prototypical domain adaptation.

Result: Demonstrates success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in few-shot keypoint detection using sketches.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

### [89] [Single-pass Adaptive Image Tokenization for Minimum Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07995)
*Shivam Duggal,Sanghyun Byun,William T. Freeman,Antonio Torralba,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity, predicting token count for images in one forward pass, matching performance of multi-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length representations in visual learning ignore input complexity. Adaptive methods require test-time search, which KARL avoids.

Method: KARL uses a single-pass approach to predict token halting based on reconstruction quality, resembling Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning.

Result: KARL performs comparably to adaptive tokenizers while being more efficient. Scaling laws and conceptual studies align with human intuition.

Conclusion: KARL efficiently adapts tokenization to input complexity, bridging AIT principles with practical visual representation learning.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

*Mingkai Jia,Wei Yin,Xiaotao Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiao-Xiao Long,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces \NickName, a method to enhance VQ-VAEs by improving codebook representation, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-VAEs lag behind VAEs in reconstruction quality due to quantization limitations. The goal is to bridge this gap by improving codebook representation.

Method: The proposed method retains latent dimensions for feature preservation and uses sub-codebooks for quantization. It also introduces high-resolution zero-shot benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: \NickName outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rFID (0.49 vs. 0.91) on ImageNet and better PSNR on zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method advances VQ-VAEs by enhancing reconstruction quality, making it suitable for high-fidelity HD image tasks.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD
image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, featuring traceable evidence and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR, a training paradigm, improves performance on benchmarks like TreeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack a holistic benchmark for visual grounded reasoning, prompting the creation of TreeBench to evaluate capabilities like traceable evidence and complex reasoning.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence via bounding boxes, and second-order reasoning. It includes 405 annotated QA pairs. TreeVGR uses reinforcement learning to jointly supervise localization and reasoning.

Result: Advanced models struggle on TreeBench (<60% accuracy). TreeVGR improves performance on benchmarks, e.g., +13.4 on TreeBench.

Conclusion: Traceability is crucial for advancing vision-grounded reasoning. TreeBench and TreeVGR provide tools for better evaluation and training.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### [92] [Impact of Pretraining Word Co-occurrence on Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08000)
*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how word co-occurrence statistics in pretraining data affect CLIP/LMM performance, showing strong correlations between PMI and accuracy, and highlights the need for better compositional generalization in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how concept combinations in training data impact compositional generalization in CLIP and LMMs, particularly when common objects appear in uncommon pairings.

Method: Uses PMI to measure word co-occurrence, tests on synthetic and edited natural images, and evaluates CLIP/LMM performance.

Result: Strong correlation between PMI and accuracy (r=0.97 for synthetic images, r=0.75 for natural images), with similar effects in LMMs (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved algorithms/architectures for compositional generalization in multimodal models without relying on combinatorial scaling of training data.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning approach for carotid artery segmentation in multi-sequence MRI, addressing plaque complexity and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid arteries and plaques in MRI is vital for atherosclerosis and stroke risk assessment, but challenges include complex plaque morphology and limited labeled data.

Method: Proposes a two-network system: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation, using a multi-level multi-sequence U-Net and semi-supervised learning with input transformations.

Result: Evaluated on 52 patients, the approach shows effectiveness, with fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning improving segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning for carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI scenarios.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning autoencoders (D-CNN and VQ-VAE) for compressing industrial XCT data, evaluating their impact on recovered data quality and introducing an edge-preservation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient storage solutions for large imaging datasets due to advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: Used D-CNN and VQ-VAE with varying compression rates on XCT data from a sandstone sample, comparing decoded image quality to original data and introducing an edge-preservation metric.

Result: Different architectures and compression rates are needed based on specific data characteristics to preserve quality for later analysis.

Conclusion: The findings help scientists choose appropriate data storage and analysis strategies.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GridTD is a new unsupervised continuous representation framework for compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, combining multi-resolution grid encoding and tensor decomposition for efficient and accurate high-dimensional image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised representations for CI reconstruction struggle to balance representation ability and efficiency. GridTD addresses this gap.

Method: GridTD uses a lightweight neural network and tensor decomposition model, optimized via multi-resolution hash grid encoding, leveraging hierarchical modeling and compactness.

Result: Theoretical analyses and experiments in video SCI, spectral SCI, and dynamic MRI show GridTD outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: GridTD is a versatile, state-of-the-art CI reconstruction method with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

TL;DR: A framework for generating synthetic breast ultrasound images using clinical descriptions and structural masks to enhance deep learning models for breast cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of expert-annotated data limits robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound image analysis.

Method: Proposes a generative framework integrating clinical descriptions and structural masks to synthesize tumors with controlled characteristics. Includes a semantic-curvature mask generator for diverse tumor masks.

Result: Synthetic images improve downstream diagnosis tasks and pass visual Turing tests by sonographers, confirming realism.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances clinical applications for breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

TL;DR: A deep learning framework integrates multimodal data (CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, genomic) to improve recurrence prediction in ccRCC, addressing limitations of single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prognostic models for ccRCC recurrence lack accuracy due to reliance on single data modalities, failing to capture disease complexity.

Method: A DL framework combines domain-specific models (CLAM for histopathology, MeD-3D for CT/MRI, MLP for clinical/genomic data) with early and late fusion strategies to handle multimodal data and missing modalities.

Result: The framework enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging complementary information from diverse data sources, even with incomplete data.

Conclusion: This approach improves ccRCC recurrence prediction and clinical decision-making by integrating multimodal data effectively.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

TL;DR: ArteryX is a MATLAB-based toolbox for quantifying cerebrovascular features from 3D TOF MRA, addressing limitations of existing methods with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing cerebral vasculature lack standardization and sensitivity to subtle changes, hindering early detection of cerebrovascular pathology.

Method: ArteryX uses a semi-supervised, vessel-fused network-based approach to track and quantify vascular features, validated on human subjects with small vessel disease.

Result: ArteryX outperforms existing methods in sensitivity and processing time (~10-15 minutes per subject) and integrates a simulation framework for validation.

Conclusion: ArteryX offers a standardized, efficient tool for early detection and comparison of cerebrovascular pathology, advancing research and clinical workflows.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
