Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGLC framework combines global and local features for high-resolution image dehazing, improving PSNR and visual fidelity in large-scale imagery.", "motivation": "Current dehazing models struggle with high-resolution images, often requiring downsampling or patching that degrades performance due to difficulty in combining global context with local details.", "method": "Proposes SGLC framework with two components: Global Features Generator (GFG) for broad contextual understanding and Local Features Enhancer (LFE) for refining localized details.

In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an\neffective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video\nunderstanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.\nSpecifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise\nSurgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video\nencoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video\nReconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate\nsurgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware\nMultimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved\nmultimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of\nsurgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble\nto efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.\nExtensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,\nincluding captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness\nof our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks.

Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,\nour proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested\nanisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and\nvideos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the\ndata and the shape of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE) to address limitations of existing positional encodings in medical imaging, showing superior performance in anisotropic settings across multiple medical imaging tasks.", "motivation": "Standard positional encodings (SPEs and IFPEs) are suboptimal for medical imaging due to challenges with complex anatomical shapes and anisotropic nature of high-dimensional medical images.

In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL).
