To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of\nsuch images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a\npromising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high\ncomputational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel\ntraining-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous\nautoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the\nvalue of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive\nreconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these\ntwo reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further\ncalibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which\ninherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with\nautoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.\nExperiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%\nhigher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while\nrequiring only 1% of the computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "AEDR is a training-free attribution method for generative models, improving accuracy and efficiency by using double-reconstruction and image homogeneity calibration.", "motivation": "Addressing security concerns from photorealistic image generation by improving attribution accuracy and reducing computational costs.", "method": "AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, using the loss ratio as the attribution signal, calibrated by image homogeneity.", "result": "AEDR achieves 25.5% higher accuracy than existing methods and requires only 1% of the computational time.", "conclusion": "AEDR offers a scalable and efficient solution for tracing the origin of images generated by SOTA models."}}

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

In this work, we introduce a systematic,\ncircuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual\nsemantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our\nframework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing\ncircuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we\ndiscover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object\ntokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.\nFurthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions\nemerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.\nIn contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we\nreveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional\nlocalization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant\nmechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a\nfoundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "A circuit-based framework reveals how spatiotemporal semantics are processed in LVLMs, showing localized object tokens and refined concepts in middle-to-late layers.", "motivation": "To understand the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding, which remains poorly studied.", "method": "Introduces a framework with three circuits: visual auditing, semantic tracing, and attention flow, to analyze spatiotemporal semantics.", "result": "Visual semantics are localized to specific object tokens (removal degrades performance by 92.6%), and interpretable concepts emerge in middle-to-late layers.", "conclusion": "The study provides mechanistic insights into LVLMs' spatiotemporal semantics, aiding the design of more robust and interpretable models."}}

However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.
