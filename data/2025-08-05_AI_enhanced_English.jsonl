However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.
