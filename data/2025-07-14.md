### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-aware framework improves vision-language models for precision agriculture by combining expert evaluation and self-consistency mechanisms, boosting diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models underperform in specialized agricultural domains, necessitating a more reliable solution for crop disease identification and treatment.

Method: The framework uses prompt-based expert evaluation and a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism to enhance model reliability, tested on maize leaf disease identification.

Result: Improvements include diagnostic accuracy (82.2% to 87.8%), symptom analysis (38.9% to 52.2%), and treatment recommendation (27.8% to 43.3%).

Conclusion: The compact system shows promise for reliable AI-driven precision agriculture tools in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Text-to-Image models' adherence to prompts, revealing their struggles with simple tasks and distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in LLMs, multimodal models like Text-to-Image lack robust evaluation methods, prompting this study.

Method: A novel dataset and pipeline using GPT-4o for ground-truth and generated image descriptions, tested on Stable Diffusion and Janus models.

Result: Models fail to generate simple binary images or align with input distribution, highlighting reliability issues.

Conclusion: Text-to-Image models need further research to improve robustness and prompt adherence.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNTLoRA improves LoRA fine-tuning by using a data-driven initialization method, enhancing convergence and performance without training during initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with fixed ranks, limiting performance. CNTLoRA addresses this by leveraging pre-training and fine-tuning activations for better initialization.

Method: CNTLoRA formulates LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem, deriving a closed-form estimate of weights from pre-training weights and fine-tuning activations. It allows variable ranks for up and down matrices.

Result: CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven initialization methods in tasks like image generation, classification, and understanding, with faster convergence and better performance.

Conclusion: CNTLoRA provides an optimal, training-free initialization method for LoRA, improving fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) combining ELM-based autoencoders and Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic for active image classification in UAVs, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image classification for UAVs by integrating unsupervised feature extraction and supervised classification using fuzzy logic, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Method: HML-ELM uses ELM-AEs for unsupervised feature extraction and a Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) for classification, validated on benchmark and real-world UAV tasks.

Result: HML-ELM outperforms ML-ELM, ML-FELM, and ELM in image classification, demonstrating higher efficiency in both benchmark and UAV experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed HML-ELM is effective for active image classification in UAVs, offering improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preprocessing of hyperspectral satellite images by identifying the best machine learning approach for cloud and shadow masking.

Method: Evaluated gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) and CNNs, focusing on accuracy, storage, and inference speed.

Result: All models exceeded 93% accuracy; CNN with feature reduction was most efficient, balancing accuracy, storage, and speed.

Conclusion: Lightweight AI models like CNNs are viable for real-time hyperspectral processing, aiding on-board satellite AI systems.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of denoising algorithms, designed for Gaussian noise, when applied to non-Gaussian noise types like uniform or Beta distributions, without modifying the algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of denoising algorithms when used with noise types significantly different from the Gaussian noise they were designed for.

Method: The study applies the original algorithm unchanged to non-Gaussian noise (e.g., uniform, Beta, or mixed Gaussians) and evaluates its performance, using small-scale experiments on a laptop.

Result: The paper does not specify explicit results but highlights the challenge of adapting observations to different scenarios.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for further investigation into how denoising algorithms perform under varied noise conditions, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DL-based method for estimating building heights from single VHR SAR images shows strong performance, especially in Europe, with potential for cross-continental applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation from VHR SAR imagery is vital for urban applications, but existing methods lack robustness in diverse settings.

Method: Uses an object-based regression approach with bounding box detection and height estimation, trained on a multi-continental dataset with cross-validation for OOD generalization.

Result: Achieves MAE of ~2.20m in European cities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, though variability increases in non-European regions like Asia.

Conclusion: DL shows significant promise for robust cross-city and cross-continental building height estimation from single VHR SAR images.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS is a 3D Gaussian registration framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views, combining feed-forward networks and optimal transport for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited priors, and feed-forward approaches lack flexibility for more input views.

Method: RegGS uses an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to solve MW₂ distance for GMM alignment in Sim(3) space, integrating photometric consistency and depth geometry.

Result: RegGS achieves high-fidelity registration, precise pose estimation, and high-quality novel-view synthesis on RE10K and ACID datasets.

Conclusion: RegGS effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges by combining feed-forward networks and optimal transport, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

### [11] [Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08137)
*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for dynamic human-object interaction reconstruction from monocular video, addressing occlusions and temporal inconsistencies with amodal completion and temporal context integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods struggle with occlusions and dynamic scenes, leading to degraded performance. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses amodal completion to infer obscured regions and integrates temporal context for coherence across video sequences. Template-free and adaptable.

Result: Validated with 3D Gaussian Splatting, showing superior precision in handling occlusions and temporal stability.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing techniques in dynamic scene reconstruction, especially in occluded scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

*Frederick Shpilevskiy,Saiyue Lyu,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Mathias Lécuyer,Pierre-André Noël*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing certifies vision model predictions against adversarial examples by leveraging guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness of vision models against adversarial attacks by adapting to inputs and providing provable certifications.

Method: Reinterprets guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms, composed via a GDP privacy filter for end-to-end robustness analysis.

Result: Improves both certified and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an ℓ₂ threat model under specific guiding.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines adaptive mechanisms with GDP for robust adversarial certification.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

*Jareen Anjom,Rashik Iram Chowdhury,Tarbia Hasan,Md. Ishan Arefin Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight real-time alert system for visually impaired individuals in Bangladesh uses depth estimation and object detection to prevent collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired people face daily commuting challenges due to urban obstructions and road accidents, necessitating an alert system.

Method: The system employs transfer learning for depth estimation and object detection, optimized with quantization for efficiency on embedded systems.

Result: Achieved a lightweight model with an mAP50 of 0.801 for real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively assists visually impaired individuals in navigating busy urban environments.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HNOSeg-XS, a resolution-robust architecture for medical image segmentation using learnable PDEs via Hartley transform, outperforming CNNs and transformers in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of CNNs (limited receptive fields) and transformers (high computational cost) in medical image segmentation, especially with high-resolution inputs.

Method: Uses learnable partial differential equations via Fourier neural operator, modified with Hartley transform for efficiency, creating the HNOSeg-XS model.

Result: Achieves superior resolution robustness, fewer than 34.7k parameters, fastest inference (<0.24s), and best memory efficiency (<1.8 GiB) on BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets.

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS is a highly efficient, resolution-robust solution for medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional CNNs and transformers.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

*Jackson Borchardt,Saul Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfDist is a CNN architecture for 3D volumetric instance segmentation, improving upon StarDist-3D by enabling high-resolution predictions without voxel artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of StarDist-3D, particularly its coupling of instance parameterization dimension and voxel resolution, and to enable smoother, higher-resolution instance segmentation.

Method: Modifies StarDist-3D to predict instances as closed surfaces with smooth parametric patches (bicubic Bézier triangles), decoupling resolution from parameterization.

Result: Outperforms StarDist-3D on blob-shaped instances in biomedical imaging, with more compact parameterizations and artifact-free upsampling.

Conclusion: SurfDist effectively learns interpretable instance surface models while maintaining instance membership accuracy, demonstrating its superiority for certain datasets.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the applicability of the CLIP-EBC framework,
originally designed for crowd counting, to car object counting using the CARPK

performance compared to existing methods. In addition, we propose a K-means
weighted clustering method to estimate object positions based on predicted
density maps, indicating the framework's potential extension to localization
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in accurately identifying fungi species due to fine-grained inter-species and high intra-species variations.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), a smartphone-based tool for objectively measuring movement in clinical settings, validated for accuracy and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is a vital but underutilized health indicator; current clinical methods lack objective measurement tools.

Method: PBL combines a cloud-enabled smartphone app and a novel algorithm to analyze biomechanical data, validated across diverse patient groups.

Result: PBL achieved joint angle errors within 3 degrees, high reliability, and sensitivity to clinical differences, outperforming patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusion: PBL offers a scalable, low-burden solution for clinically meaningful biomechanical data, enhancing mobility impairment monitoring.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

*Jiang Qin,Bin Zou,Haolin Li,Lamei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CR-Net improves cross-resolution SAR target detection by integrating structure priors and evidential learning, enhancing feature adaptation and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher SAR resolution causes scattering discrepancies, challenging model generalization. Domain adaptation struggles with blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantics.

Method: CR-Net uses SHFA for structure-aware feature adaptation and RSAA for reliable semantic alignment, leveraging adjacency sets for knowledge transfer.

Result: CR-Net achieves SOTA performance by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability in cross-resolution datasets.

Conclusion: CR-Net effectively addresses cross-resolution SAR target detection challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2DAO-Talker introduces a unified framework for audio-driven talking head generation, improving motion modeling and rendering quality via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D methods for talking head generation suffer from rendering artifacts like motion blur and local penetration due to unstable motion field representation.

Method: The framework involves video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. It uses multi-granular motion decoupling (non-rigid and rigid motions) and alternating optimization for refinement.

Result: M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.43 dB PSNR improvement, 0.64 gain in user-evaluated realness, and 150 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses motion artifacts and enhances realism in talking head generation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using convolutional Siamese networks for craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science, achieving satisfactory identification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forensic identification by mapping skull X-rays to corresponding faces using deep learning.

Method: Uses convolutional Siamese networks to learn cross-domain identity representations, minimizing Euclidean distance for similar pairs and maximizing for dissimilar ones.

Result: Satisfactory identification results on a custom dataset of 40 volunteers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies individuals from skull X-rays, demonstrating potential for forensic applications.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretability-guided pruning framework to reduce deep learning model complexity in medical imaging while maintaining performance and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning's clinical adoption is limited by large model sizes and lack of transparency, despite advances in interpretability techniques.

Method: An interpretability-guided pruning framework selectively retains relevant parts of each layer to compress models without losing meaningful representations.

Result: The method achieves high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across medical image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach enables lightweight, interpretable models suitable for real-world healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot enhances generative CBMs by eliminating auxiliary cues, improving interpretability and controllability through explicit concepts and diffusion-based energy functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous generative CBMs rely on auxiliary visual cues, compromising interpretability and compositionality. CoCo-Bot aims to address this by transmitting all information through explicit concepts.

Method: CoCo-Bot uses diffusion-based energy functions to enable post-hoc interventions like concept composition and negation, eliminating the need for auxiliary cues.

Result: Experiments on StyleGAN2 with CelebA-HQ show CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot advances generative CBMs by enhancing interpretability and controllability without auxiliary cues, supported by robust post-hoc interventions.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the poor generalization of multimodal prognosis models in cross-cancer scenarios and proposes two modules (SDIR and CADE) to enhance weaker modality signals and improve integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for survival prediction focus on single cancer types and lack generalization across cancers, which is crucial for clinical practice.

Method: Introduces SDIR for feature rebalancing and CADE for synthesizing target domain distribution, combining local and global data.

Result: Experiments show superior generalization on a four-cancer-type benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed modules improve robustness in cross-cancer multimodal prognosis, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRAG is a multi-range adversarial stego generation framework combining convolution and transformer for deep hiding, improving imperceptibility and resistance to steganalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hiding methods are easily detected due to large payloads and limited feature extraction, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: MRAG integrates local-range convolution and global-range transformer, uses multi-grained frequency decomposition, and employs angle-norm disentanglement loss.

Result: MRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining secret restorability and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: MRAG effectively addresses detection issues in deep hiding, offering a superior adversarial stego generation framework.

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a framework to improve in-context learning (ICL) for medical image segmentation by self-verifying predictions and enhancing contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL's performance in medical image segmentation is sensitive to query-context alignment, and fine-tuning is impractical due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: CCV uses a cyclic pipeline to validate predictions by swapping query and context roles, updating prompts to improve alignment.

Result: CCV outperforms existing methods on seven datasets, demonstrating robust universal segmentation.

Conclusion: CCV enhances ICL-based segmentation, offering a practical solution for universal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores ChatGPT-4o's ability to interpret traffic scenes for elderly driver assessments, showing improved performance with better prompts but challenges in ambiguous scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if multimodal LLMs like ChatGPT-4o can perform human-like traffic scene interpretations for elderly driver evaluations.

Method: Used zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies on dashcam images, comparing model outputs to human annotations via precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Prompt design significantly impacted performance, with recall for intersection visibility rising from 21.7% to 57.0%. Traffic density agreement improved from 53.5% to 67.6%. Stop-sign detection showed high precision (86.3%) but lower recall (76.7%).

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts make LLMs promising for driving risk assessments, though scalability and ambiguity challenges remain for future research.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFU, a method bridging low-light enhancement and understanding, using diffusion models and SCUF for improved generalization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat low-light enhancement and understanding separately, limiting generalization and scalability due to reliance on specific priors and scarce labeled data.

Method: Leverages pretrained generative diffusion models for zero-shot generalization and proposes SCUF with illumination-aware prompts and cycle-attention adapters for semantic consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and tasks like classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: GEFU successfully bridges low-light enhancement and understanding, improving both generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Method: The ODOR dataset is created with 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, covering 139 fine-grained categories. Statistical analysis and baseline object detection model evaluations are conducted.

Result: The dataset exhibits challenging properties like dense and overlapping objects, detailed categories, and spatial distribution across the entire image canvas. Baseline analyses reveal its difficulty for current models.

Conclusion: The ODOR dataset advances research in artwork object detection and cultural heritage studies, encouraging exploration of object recognition and smell perception intersections.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a two-stage framework for text-to-image generation that ensures subject consistency while maintaining pose and layout diversity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for subject-consistent generation (SCG) in text-to-image models often sacrifice pose and layout diversity, limiting expressive storytelling.

Method: CoDi uses a two-stage approach: Identity Transport (IT) for early denoising to transfer identity features pose-aware, and Identity Refinement (IR) for later denoising to refine subject details.

Result: CoDi achieves superior subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity, validated by qualitative and quantitative results.

Conclusion: CoDi effectively balances subject consistency with pose and layout diversity, advancing expressive visual storytelling in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

### [33] [PanMatch: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Models for Unified Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08400)
*Yongjian Zhang,Longguang Wang,Kunhong Li,Ye Zhang,Yun Wang,Liang Lin,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch is a versatile foundation model for correspondence matching, unifying tasks like stereo matching and optical flow under a 2D displacement framework without task-specific weights. It leverages robust feature extraction and large vision models for zero-shot capabilities, outperforming specialized models in cross-task and zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate the need for task-specific architectures and fine-tuning in correspondence matching, aiming for a unified, generalizable solution.

Method: PanMatch uses a 2D displacement estimation framework with shared model weights, a robust feature extractor, and a feature transformation pipeline leveraging large vision models. It is pretrained on a cross-domain dataset of 1.8M samples.

Result: PanMatch outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything in cross-task evaluations and matches task-specific algorithms in benchmarks. It excels in zero-shot scenarios like rainy days and satellite imagery.

Conclusion: PanMatch demonstrates robust generalization across tasks and domains, offering a unified solution for correspondence matching with superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

### [34] [Deep Hashing with Semantic Hash Centers for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08404)
*Li Chen,Rui Liu,Yuxiang Zhou,Xudong Ma,Yong Chen,Dell Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHC introduces semantic hash centers to improve image retrieval by preserving semantic relationships between classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point-wise hashing methods neglect semantic relationships between classes, potentially degrading retrieval performance.

Method: A three-stage framework (SHC) includes a classification network for semantic similarity, an optimization algorithm for semantic hash centers, and a deep hashing network for binary hash codes.

Result: SHC achieves significant improvements in MAP metrics (+7.26% to +11.71%) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHC enhances retrieval performance by incorporating semantic relationships into hash center generation.

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

*Shijun Yang,Xiang Zhang,Wanqing Zhao,Hangzai Luo,Sheng Zhong,Jinye Peng,Jianping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP introduces a novel prompt learning paradigm using MLLMs for adaptive prompt generation, addressing challenges in VLMs by enhancing cross-modal alignment and class embedding modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization on novel classes and enhance cross-modal alignment in VLMs, which current methods limit to the final output layer.

Method: MuGCP uses MLLMs for Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP), an Attention Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module for Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), and a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 14 datasets.

Conclusion: MuGCP effectively addresses limitations in prompt learning for VLMs, achieving superior performance through adaptive prompt generation and multi-modal alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

### [36] [InstaScene: Towards Complete 3D Instance Decomposition and Reconstruction from Cluttered Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08416)
*Zesong Yang,Bangbang Yang,Wenqi Dong,Chenxuan Cao,Liyuan Cui,Yuewen Ma,Zhaopeng Cui,Hujun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaScene introduces a method for holistic 3D scene perception, focusing on decomposing instances and ensuring complete reconstruction using spatial contrastive learning and in-situ generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can mentally complete occluded objects, but robotics struggle with this task. Current methods fail to recognize complete objects from partial observations.

Method: Uses spatial contrastive learning for precise decomposition and in-situ generation to guide 3D models for complete reconstruction.

Result: Achieves superior decomposition accuracy and produces geometrically faithful, visually intact objects in complex scenes.

Conclusion: InstaScene effectively bridges the gap in 3D perception by combining decomposition and completion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

### [37] [Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422)
*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU accelerates diffusion transformers by mixed-resolution sampling and noise-timestep rescheduling, achieving up to 7x speed-up with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy computation in diffusion transformers hinders real-world deployment; existing methods focus on temporal acceleration, leaving spatial dimension underutilized.

Method: RALU uses three stages: low-resolution denoising, region-adaptive upsampling, and full-resolution refinement, with noise-timestep rescheduling for stability.

Result: Achieves up to 7x speed-up on FLUX and 3x on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

Conclusion: RALU is a training-free, complementary spatial acceleration method that preserves quality and integrates with temporal optimizations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

### [38] [RePaintGS: Reference-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Realistic and View-Consistent 3D Scene Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08434)
*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene inpainting method improves geometric fidelity and appearance consistency by leveraging a reference view to guide optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene inpainting methods suffer from inconsistencies between viewpoints due to varied plausible completions from image inpainting techniques.

Method: The proposed method uses a reference view to estimate inpainting similarity, adjust contributions of other views, and warp the reference inpainting to guide optimization.

Result: The approach enhances geometric fidelity and appearance consistency in inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: The method reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results for complex scenes.

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

*Anlin Zheng,Xin Wen,Xuanyang Zhang,Chuofan Ma,Tiancai Wang,Gang Yu,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFMTok, an image tokenizer built on pre-trained vision foundation models, improves image reconstruction and generation quality with region-adaptive quantization and semantic reconstruction. It achieves a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet and accelerates model convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored area of building image tokenizers directly on pre-trained vision foundation models for better semantic fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Uses a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder, introduces region-adaptive quantization to reduce redundancy, and a semantic reconstruction objective for alignment.

Result: Substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation, achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet, 3x faster convergence, and high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without CFG.

Conclusion: VFMTok demonstrates the potential of leveraging pre-trained vision models for image tokenization, offering efficiency and quality gains in image generation tasks.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

*Wei Zhang,Yihang Wu,Songhua Li,Wenjie Ma,Xin Ma,Qiang Li,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews deep learning-based 3D reconstruction, focusing on feed-forward models like DUSt3R, comparing them to traditional methods and discussing future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., SfM, MVS) are computationally expensive and struggle in challenging scenarios. Deep learning offers a more efficient and robust alternative.

Method: The paper analyzes feed-forward models, particularly DUSt3R, which use unified deep networks to infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from images in one pass. It also reviews Transformer-based correspondence and joint pose-geometry regression.

Result: Feed-forward models simplify workflows and improve robustness compared to traditional methods, though challenges like accuracy and scalability remain.

Conclusion: Deep learning is transforming 3D reconstruction, with feed-forward models showing promise. Future work should address accuracy, scalability, and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

*Benjamin Meyer,Lukas Tuggener,Sascha Hänzi,Daniel Schmid,Erdal Ayfer,Benjamin F. Grewe,Ahmed Abdulkadir,Thilo Stadelmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating document recognition as a transcription task, leveraging intrinsic document structures, and introduces a transformer-based method with structure-specific inductive biases for improved performance on complex documents like engineering drawings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document recognition methods overlook intrinsic structural properties, relying on heuristic post-processing and struggling with less common or complex document types.

Method: Frames document recognition as a transcription task, designs structure-specific inductive biases, and adapts a transformer architecture for various document structures.

Result: Demonstrates success in transcribing complex documents (e.g., engineering drawings) end-to-end, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach advances document recognition for less common types and guides future designs of document foundation models.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dewarping methods focus only on horizontal dimensions, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by incorporating vertical line awareness for better distortion perception.

Method: Proposes D2Dewarp, a model with fine-grained deformation perception in dual dimensions (horizontal-vertical). Introduces a fusion module for feature interaction and creates a new dataset with automatic annotation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks, achieving better rectification results quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: D2Dewarp advances document dewarping by integrating dual-dimensional features and provides a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be

*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR introduces occlusion-guided feature purification via reinforced knowledge distillation to handle diverse occlusions and avoid feature contamination in person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen occlusion scenarios and feature contamination from holistic images.

Method: OGFR uses a teacher-student distillation architecture with an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer and a Feature Erasing and Purification Module to model occlusion patterns and purify features.

Result: The method effectively learns robust representations despite occlusions by transferring purified holistic knowledge.

Conclusion: OGFR addresses occlusion challenges in person re-identification by combining occlusion-aware modeling and feature purification.

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

Motivation: Current methods are limited to 2D images and require full annotations, restricting clinical flexibility. The goal is to leverage 3D data and reduce annotation burden.

Method: Uses a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) for tumor embeddings, aligns them with radiomics features via contrastive learning, and enriches with anatomical positional embedding (APE).

Result: Outperforms on lung CT and brain MRI datasets, with radiomics enhancing specificity and APE aiding location-based searches. Works with minimal prompts (e.g., single point).

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval offers adaptable, efficient retrieval for clinical use, supporting diagnosis, treatment, and research with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2, a top-performing object segmentation model, is enhanced with reinforcement learning for memory updates, outperforming existing heuristics by 3x in overfitting setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SAM 2's handling of distractors, occlusions, and object motion by replacing hand-crafted update rules with reinforcement learning.

Method: Frames memory control as a sequential decision-making problem, using reinforcement learning to optimize memory updates in SAM 2.

Result: Achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds existing heuristics by more than three times in overfitting setups.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is a powerful alternative to hand-crafted rules for memory control in visual object tracking, unlocking the potential of SAM 2's memory bank.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-KPN, a novel image translation method, ensures semantic matching for synthetic-to-real data translation, outperforming GAN-based methods in semantic segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain gap in semantic segmentation due to limited real-world annotations by improving synthetic-to-real data translation.

Method: DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise transformation parameters using a lightweight function and enforces realism via multi-scale discriminators.

Result: Outperforms GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks and achieves comparable performance in face parsing.

Conclusion: DA-KPN effectively bridges the domain gap for semantic segmentation with limited real labels.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC introduces a dual-stream paradigm for 3D Semantic Scene Completion, enhancing instance and scene learning by replacing voxel queries with class queries, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voxel-level methods limit class-level information utilization, critical for granular completion.

Method: DISC uses class queries and specialized decoding modules for targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow.

Result: Achieves mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55 on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360, outperforming multi-frame methods with single-frame input.

Conclusion: DISC significantly improves instance and scene completion, setting new benchmarks in 3D SSC.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy

descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesTTA addresses gradual distribution shifts in VLMs by using Bayesian adaptation for temporally consistent predictions and dynamic representation alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual test-time adaptation methods fail under gradual distribution shifts, leading to catastrophic forgetting, unreliable confidence, and misaligned representations.

Method: BayesTTA uses Bayesian adaptation, estimating class-conditional Gaussian mixtures, adaptive covariance selection, and calibrated inference via GDA, with self-paced normalization layer updates.

Result: BayesTTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on temporally evolving datasets and generalizes well on standard TTA benchmarks.

Conclusion: BayesTTA effectively handles gradual distribution shifts, improving robustness and efficiency in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates DAN for extracting key-value info from Uruguayan birth certificates, comparing two annotation strategies. Normalized annotation works better for standardized fields, while diplomatic annotation excels for non-standardized fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of DAN for transcribing handwritten birth certificates and compare annotation strategies with minimal training data.

Method: Fine-tuning DAN on two datasets with different annotation methods (normalized and diplomatic) using 201 scans of birth certificates.

Result: Normalized annotation is better for standardized fields (dates, places), while diplomatic annotation is superior for non-standardized fields (names, surnames).

Conclusion: Annotation strategy should be chosen based on field type for optimal transcription accuracy.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineBEV introduces a recurrent structure for temporal 3D perception, using MBFNet for feature alignment and Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited performance gain from temporal aggregation in multi-view 3D perception due to dynamic changes in BEV features caused by object motion.

Method: OnlineBEV combines BEV features over time with a recurrent structure, using MBFNet for motion-guided alignment and Temporal Consistency Learning Loss.

Result: Achieves 63.9% NDS on nuScenes, outperforming SOLOFusion.

Conclusion: OnlineBEV sets a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection by effectively aligning temporal BEV features.

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multiagent system, DatasetAgent, automates high-quality image dataset construction from real-world images using MLLMs and image optimization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset construction is time-intensive; AI-generated data lacks real-world value. DatasetAgent addresses this by leveraging real-world images.

Method: DatasetAgent coordinates four agents with MLLMs and image optimization tools to auto-construct datasets based on user requirements.

Result: Experiments show DatasetAgent successfully expands existing datasets and creates new ones, training vision models for classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent efficiently constructs valuable real-world image datasets, outperforming manual and AI-generated methods.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) synthesizes 7T-quality T1-maps from 1.5T/3T T1W images, outperforming ResViT and ResShift with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior resolution but is costly and scarce. The study aims to make 7T benefits accessible via synthetic T1-maps from lower-field scans.

Method: The model was trained on paired 1.5T/3T T1W and 7T T1-map data (141 cases, 32,128 slices) and compared to ResViT and ResShift using PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE metrics.

Result: 7T-Restormer achieved higher PSNR (26.0 dB), SSIM (0.861), and lower NMSE (0.019) than ResViT and ResShift, with 64% and 41% NMSE reductions, respectively.

Conclusion: The model successfully predicts 7T-quality T1-maps from lower-field scans, enhancing clinical accessibility to 7T MRI benefits.

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay is a training-free framework using Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP) to enhance MLLMs' spatial reasoning and grounding without parameter changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MLLMs' performance in spatial reasoning and reduce hallucinations without requiring model retraining.

Method: Segments scenes into depth layers (closest, mid-range, farthest) using monocular depth estimation, generates region-specific captions, and appends them to prompts for enriched spatial context.

Result: Shows consistent improvements on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks across multiple MLLMs.

Conclusion: Depth-aware prompting (LDP) effectively enhances MLLMs' performance in a zero-training setting, offering a lightweight and modular solution.

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: MoSAiC is a unified CL framework for multi-modal satellite imagery, addressing challenges like high inter-class similarity and ambiguous boundaries. It outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning (CL) excels in representation learning but struggles with Earth System Observation (ESO) challenges like multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities.

Method: MoSAiC jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss, tailored for multi-modal satellite imagery.

Result: MoSAiC outperforms fully supervised and self-supervised baselines on BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS datasets in accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization.

Conclusion: MoSAiC effectively addresses ESO challenges, offering robust representation learning for spectrally similar and spatially complex classes.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

TL;DR: A training-free MRI muscle segmentation method using keypoint tracking and optical flow achieves comparable accuracy to CNNs with lower computational cost and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated MRI muscle segmentation faces challenges like high computational costs, large training data needs, and limited accuracy for smaller muscles. CNN-based methods also struggle with overhead, generalizability, and interpretability.

Method: Proposes a training-free approach combining keypoint selection and Lucas-Kanade optical flow for segmentation.

Result: Achieves mean DSC of 0.6-0.7, comparable to CNNs, with reduced computational demands and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, robust, and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-CLIPScore is a lightweight, efficient embedding-based metric for evaluating and training captioning models, derived from a compressed and distilled version of CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and resource-friendly alternative to CLIP for evaluating and training captioning models.

Method: Uses weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for compression, and a multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss for distillation.

Result: L-CLIP achieves comparable performance to CLIP with fewer resources and faster runtime.

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore is effective for caption evaluation but should be combined with n-gram metrics for training to avoid failure.

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Result: SGPMIL achieves competitive bag-level performance and significantly improves instance-level prediction quality and interpretability under uncertainty.

Conclusion: SGPMIL enhances MIL by providing principled uncertainty estimation, faster training, and better instance-level performance, validated on digital pathology datasets.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for multi-camera vehicle tracking lack realism, with simplistic scenarios and low resolution, limiting practical applications. RoundaboutHD addresses this by providing a comprehensive, real-world roundabout dataset.

Method: The dataset includes 40 minutes of 4K video from four non-overlapping cameras, annotated with 512 unique vehicle identities. It supports tasks like detection, tracking, and re-identification, with additional subsets and metadata for analysis.

Result: RoundaboutHD offers enhanced challenges (e.g., occlusions, nonlinear movement) and baseline results for various tasks, making it a robust benchmark for MCVT research.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD fills a critical gap in MCVT datasets, providing realistic, high-quality data to advance research and applications in smart cities.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The
dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at:

*Anna Rosenberg,John Kennedy,Zohar Keidar,Yehoshua Y. Zeevi,Guy Gilboa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features to address insufficient training data in computer vision, demonstrating superior performance in a medical imaging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of sufficient training data in computer vision problems motivates the use of STV features, which are empirically lowly correlated and effective for texture characterization.

Method: Ensembles of weak learners are designed using STV features, leveraging their low correlation. The approach is tested on CT and PET data for predicting high uptake in PET scans.

Result: STV learners outperform deep-learning and Radiomics methods, achieving an AUC of 0.87 compared to 0.75 (neural nets) and 0.79 (Radiomics). Fine STV scales in CT are particularly predictive.

Conclusion: STV-based ensembles are effective for medical imaging tasks, offering better performance than competing methods, especially in cases of limited training data.

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

### [64] [HieraRS: A Hierarchical Segmentation Paradigm for Remote Sensing Enabling Multi-Granularity Interpretation and Cross-Domain Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08741)
*Tianlong Ai,Tianzhu Liu,Haochen Jiang,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraRS introduces a hierarchical interpretation paradigm for LCLU classification, addressing flat classification limitations and cross-domain transfer challenges with heterogeneous hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack multi-granularity hierarchical predictions and struggle with cross-domain tasks involving heterogeneous hierarchies.

Method: Proposes HieraRS with BHCCM for hierarchical predictions and TransLU for cross-domain transfer, supported by the MM-5B dataset.

Result: Enhances semantic consistency, classification accuracy, and model flexibility in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: HieraRS improves hierarchical LCLU classification and cross-domain adaptability, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

*Rei Tamaru,Pei Li,Bin Ran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT introduces a unified framework for dynamic roadway geometry sensing in Digital Twins, combining real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning to address scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Digital Twins in transportation rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability, and face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework includes GeoLane (lightweight lane detection), Meta-GeoLane (personalized detection), and FedMeta-GeoLane (federated learning). It integrates with CARLA and SUMO for high-fidelity DT rendering.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane outperforms baselines, achieving lower geometric error, better generalization, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT provides a scalable, privacy-preserving foundation for flexible, context-aware infrastructure modeling in Digital Twins.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

*Juntong Fan,Zhiwei Hao,Jianqiang Shen,Shang-Ling Jui,Yi Zhang,Jing-Xiao Liao,Feng-Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Birkhoff is a data-free compression algorithm for SAMs, offering versatility, agility, faithfulness, and compactness. It introduces Hyper-Compression and HyperLinear for efficient compression and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of SAMs in diverse fields creates a need for efficient compression methods without compromising performance.

Method: Birkhoff uses Hyper-Compression to reduce parameter dimensionality and HyperLinear to fuse decompression with matrix multiplication.

Result: Achieves a 5.17x compression ratio on SAM2-B with <1% performance drop and completes compression in 60 seconds.

Conclusion: Birkhoff is a competitive, efficient, and versatile solution for compressing SAMs without fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining CNNs and a multi-well Hopfield network achieves 99.2% accuracy on MNIST by using deep features and energy-based classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intraclass variability in handwritten digits and provide an interpretable classification framework.

Method: Uses a CNN for feature extraction, k-means clustering for prototypes, and a Hopfield network for energy-based classification.

Result: Achieves 99.2% test accuracy on MNIST, handling diverse handwriting styles effectively.

Conclusion: Deep feature extraction and prototype coverage are key for high performance, with potential for broader pattern recognition applications.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPart introduces a part-aware diffusion framework for 3D generation, addressing limitations of single-latent representations by decomposing objects into contextual part latents, enabling part-level control and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods struggle with multi-part geometries, part independence, and fine-grained controllability, limiting their effectiveness for compositional design.

Method: CoPart decomposes 3D objects into part latents, uses mutual guidance for joint denoising, and leverages the Partverse dataset for training.

Result: CoPart excels in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with high controllability.

Conclusion: CoPart advances 3D generation by enabling part-aware modeling and control, outperforming existing methods in coherence and flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLiFTs, a neural rendering method using compressed light-field tokens for efficient scene representation and rendering, balancing quality, speed, and data size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compute-efficient rendering with rich scene representation while allowing flexibility in token count and novel view synthesis.

Method: Uses a multi-view encoder to tokenize images with poses, applies latent-space K-means for ray clustering, and compresses tokens into CLiFTs. A compute-adaptive renderer synthesizes novel views.

Result: Achieves significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets.

Conclusion: CLiFTs provide an effective trade-off between data size, rendering quality, and speed, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

TL;DR: NeuralOS is a neural framework simulating GUIs by predicting screen frames from user inputs, combining RNNs and diffusion-based rendering. It shows promise but struggles with fine-grained keyboard interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction by simulating GUIs.

Method: Uses an RNN to track state and a diffusion-based neural renderer for screen images, trained on Ubuntu XFCE recordings.

Result: Successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, captures mouse interactions, and predicts state transitions like app launches.

Conclusion: NeuralOS advances toward adaptive neural interfaces, though keyboard interaction precision remains a challenge.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos-1 is an autoregressive video generator based on LLM architecture, using MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations and AR-DF to address frame-wise loss imbalance, achieving competitive performance with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify video generation with LLM architectures while avoiding bulky encoders or high latency, and to improve spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: Introduces MM-RoPE for balanced frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions, and AR-DF for frame-wise loss balance via temporal tube masking.

Result: Competes with EMU3, COSMOS-Video2World, and OpenSoraPlan on benchmarks, trained efficiently on 48 GPUs.

Conclusion: Lumos-1 successfully adapts LLMs for video generation with minimal modifications, offering efficient and high-quality results.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.
