*Zongyou Yang,Jonathan Loo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyCAT4, an improved 3D human pose estimation model combining CNNs, Transformers, and pyramid structures for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the Pymaf network by integrating Transformer-based temporal analysis and multi-scale feature fusion for enhanced pose estimation.

Method: Introduces a Transformer layer for low-level features, temporal fusion for video sequences, and spatial pyramid structures for multi-scale fusion.

Result: PyCAT4 shows significant improvement in accuracy on COCO and 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements advance human pose estimation technology.

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

### [2] [DreamVVT: Mastering Realistic Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via a Stage-Wise Diffusion Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02807)
*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT is a two-stage framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video virtual try-on, leveraging unpaired data and pretrained models to enhance garment detail preservation and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on scarce paired datasets and fail to utilize advanced visual priors, leading to poor detail preservation and temporal inconsistency in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: DreamVVT uses a two-stage approach: (1) keyframe synthesis with a vision-language model, and (2) video generation with LoRA adapters, leveraging skeleton maps and motion descriptions.

Result: DreamVVT outperforms existing methods in preserving garment details and ensuring temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DreamVVT effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by leveraging unpaired data and advanced priors, achieving superior performance in video virtual try-on.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [3] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Replacing layer normalization with DynTanh in IJEPA preserves token energy hierarchy, improving model performance and fixing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, masking semantically important regions.

Method: Replace feature layer normalization with DynTanh activation to preserve token energies.

Result: Improves ImageNet accuracy (38% to 42.7%) and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2.

Conclusion: Preserving natural token energies is key for effective self-supervised visual learning.

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [4] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE combines NeRF's photorealistic rendering with Gaussian Splatting's editable structure, enabling real-time, interactive scene manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of NeRF (implicit, hard to edit) and Gaussian Splatting (explicit, editable but lacks NeRF's quality) by merging their strengths.

Method: Hybrid model using trainable feature embeddings for Gaussians, conditioned on a NeRF network via RT-GPS for efficient nearest Gaussian search and multi-resolution hash grids.

Result: Enables real-time, locality-aware editing and dynamic interaction while maintaining high rendering quality.

Conclusion: GENIE bridges the gap between neural rendering and geometry-based editing, supporting intuitive manipulation and physical simulation compatibility.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [5] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework uses noisy coarse annotations to approximate precise labels, outperforming weakly supervised methods and nearing fully supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality pixel-level medical image annotations are costly and require expertise; coarse annotations are more accessible but noisy.

Method: Introduces transition matrices to model noise in coarse annotations, jointly trains on multiple sets to refine outputs and infer true segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and approaches fully supervised performance on cardiac imaging datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages coarse annotations to achieve robust segmentation, reducing reliance on costly precise labels.

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [6] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR is a LiDAR detection mimicking model that bridges the gap between high-fidelity but unscalable simulators and scalable but perception-lacking traffic simulators by approximating realistic LiDAR detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitations of high-fidelity simulators and the lack of perception modeling in microscopic traffic simulators for cooperative perception in autonomous driving.

Method: MIDAR predicts true positives and false negatives from ideal LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features, employing a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture on a Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight graph.

Result: Achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating detection results by CenterPoint on the nuScenes dataset, validated in CP-based traffic applications.

Conclusion: MIDAR effectively integrates realistic detection modeling into scalable traffic simulators, enhancing applications requiring accurate vehicle observations.

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

### [7] [Evaluation and Analysis of Deep Neural Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Modern Remote Sensing Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02871)
*J. Alex Hurt,Trevor M. Bajkowski,Grant J. Scott,Curt H. Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares transformer-based neural networks and convolutional networks for object detection in satellite imagery, showing transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery compared to convolutional networks, given their success in other domains.

Method: Comparison of five transformer-based and six convolutional architectures on three remote sensing datasets, evaluating object detection performance.

Result: Transformer-based networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Transformers are highly effective for object detection in satellite imagery, outperforming traditional convolutional networks.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [8] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft enhances LVLMs for creative content generation by integrating a structured information extractor and dynamic prompt module, outperforming baselines in creativity and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with visual fidelity, creativity, and precise adherence to user instructions in long-form text generation.

Method: VisuCraft uses a multimodal structured information extractor and dynamic prompt generation module to optimize LVLM prompts.

Result: Outperforms baseline LVLMs on tasks like story generation and poetry, with notable gains in creativity and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: VisuCraft unlocks new potential for LVLMs in advanced creative AI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

### [9] [RDDPM: Robust Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02903)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes robust denoising diffusion models for unsupervised anomaly segmentation using contaminated data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models require normal data for training, limiting real-world applicability. This work addresses scenarios with only contaminated (mixed normal/anomalous) unlabeled data.

Method: Reinterprets denoising diffusion probabilistic models as nonlinear regression, using robust regression to derive robust versions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models, achieving 8.08% higher AUROC and 10.37% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

Conclusion: The novel robust framework is flexible and effective for anomaly segmentation with contaminated data, advancing practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

### [10] [How Would It Sound? Material-Controlled Multimodal Acoustic Profile Generation for Indoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02905)
*Mahnoor Fatima Saad,Ziad Al-Halah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating acoustic profiles in indoor scenes based on user-defined material configurations, using an encoder-decoder model to predict Room Impulse Responses (RIRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dynamic control over acoustic profiles in indoor environments by allowing users to specify material configurations (e.g., carpeted floors, acoustic tiles).

Method: A novel encoder-decoder approach encodes scene properties from audio-visual observations and generates RIRs conditioned on user-provided material specifications.

Result: The model effectively generates high-fidelity RIRs, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables material-controlled acoustic profile generation, supported by a new benchmark dataset (Acoustic Wonderland Dataset).

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

### [11] [Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02917)
*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether off-the-shelf LVLMs can perform VLN tasks and support both low-level and panoramic action spaces, achieving a 41% success rate on R2R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs for VLN tasks and their adaptability to different action paradigms.

Method: Fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model on the R2R dataset for both low-level and panoramic action spaces.

Result: The model achieved a 41% success rate on R2R, showing promise but lagging behind specialized models.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LVLMs can perform VLN but are less effective than task-specific models.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [12] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP estimation in blind deconvolution favors blurry solutions with sparsity-promoting priors. Diffusion-based priors reveal blurry images have higher likelihoods, but local minima correspond to natural images. Gradient descent can find these minima, solving blind deconvolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of MAP estimation favoring blurry solutions in blind deconvolution, the paper explores diffusion-based priors to understand and overcome this issue.

Method: The study examines the likelihood landscape of diffusion-based priors, identifies properties favoring blurry images, and analyzes the blind deblurring posterior theoretically. Gradient descent is used to find local minima.

Result: MAP produces sharp filters and blurry images, but local minima correspond to natural images. Gradient descent can effectively solve blind deconvolution by finding these minima.

Conclusion: Overcoming MAP's limitations requires good initialization to local minima. The findings guide improved priors and optimization techniques, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

### [13] [Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927)
*Srikanth Muralidharan,Heitor R. Medeiros,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of ImageNet pretraining on ultra-small models (<1M parameters) for robustness in infrared object detection, finding diminishing returns beyond a certain model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if ImageNet pretraining benefits small models for embedded devices, especially in robustness for infrared object detection.

Method: Constructed ultra-small backbone families using scaling laws and evaluated their performance on three datasets.

Result: ImageNet pretraining remains useful but offers diminishing robustness gains for very small models in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Practitioners should use pretraining and avoid overly small models for robustness in varied conditions.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

### [14] [X-Actor: Emotional and Expressive Long-Range Portrait Acting from Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02944)
*Chenxu Zhang,Zenan Li,Hongyi Xu,You Xie,Xiaochen Zhao,Tianpei Gu,Guoxian Song,Xin Chen,Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Actor is an audio-driven framework for generating lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single image and audio clip, outperforming prior methods in long-form, emotionally rich animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on lip sync and short-range fidelity, lacking the ability to capture nuanced, evolving emotions in long-form performances. X-Actor aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a two-stage pipeline: an autoregressive diffusion model for facial motion prediction and a diffusion-based video synthesis module for high-fidelity animations.

Result: Produces cinematic-style performances with long-range emotional coherence, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: X-Actor advances audio-driven portrait animation by enabling emotionally rich, long-form performances.

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [15] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel blind denoising framework improves robustness to out-of-distribution noise by leveraging scale equivariance, featuring Heterogeneous Normalization and Interactive Gating Modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising models struggle with generalization to spatially variant noise, highlighting a gap in OOD robustness.

Method: Proposes a framework with Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) for feature stabilization and Interactive Gating Module (IGM) for signal-feature interaction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, especially for spatially heterogeneous noise.

Conclusion: Scale-equivariant structures enhance OOD robustness, and the proposed framework is effective for blind denoising.

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER is a training-free technique for diffusion models that improves prompt adherence by leveraging internal negation understanding, outperforming baselines and human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models vary in prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting helps but is lossy. ANSWER aims to improve this without external resources.

Method: Develops ANSWER, a sampling procedure using classifier-free guidance to account for positive and negative conditions from a single prompt.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more.

Conclusion: ANSWER effectively improves diffusion model performance without training or explicit negative prompts.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

*Yusaku Takama,Ning Ding,Tatsuya Yokota,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to separate shared and domain-specific LoRAs into distinct subspaces for better multi-domain learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures may not effectively capture domain-specific information with shared and domain-specific LoRAs.

Method: Ensures shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces (column and left null subspaces of pre-trained weights).

Result: Applied to action recognition with UCF101, Kinetics400, and HMDB51 datasets, showing effectiveness in some cases.

Conclusion: The method improves domain-specific information capture, with analysis of LoRA weight dimensions.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Motivation: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, reducing generalization performance.

Method: Proposes MoExDA, a lightweight domain adaptation using edge frames alongside RGB frames to counter static bias.

Result: Effectively suppresses static bias with lower computational cost, enhancing action recognition robustness.

Conclusion: MoExDA offers a lightweight, effective solution for static bias in action recognition.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced
generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight
domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

*Zachary Yahn,Selim Furkan Tekin,Fatih Ilhan,Sihao Hu,Tiansheng Huang,Yichang Xu,Margaret Loper,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFOG is a novel adversarial attack method targeting object detection transformers and CNNs, using a learnable attention mechanism to focus perturbations, achieving superior performance and stealth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial methods are limited to CNN-based detectors or ineffective against transformers. AFOG addresses this gap by being architecture-agnostic and effective for both.

Method: AFOG employs a learnable attention mechanism to target vulnerable regions, integrates feature loss types, and iteratively injects perturbations for efficiency and stealth.

Result: AFOG outperforms baselines by up to 30.6% and existing attacks by up to 83%, with superior speed and imperceptibility, validated on twelve transformers on COCO.

Conclusion: AFOG is a versatile, efficient, and stealthy adversarial attack method, effective against both transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

### [20] [Seeing It Before It Happens: In-Generation NSFW Detection for Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03006)
*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces In-Generation Detection (IGD), a method for detecting NSFW content during the diffusion process in text-to-image models, achieving 91.32% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored in-generation phase of diffusion models for NSFW detection, leveraging predicted noise as an internal signal.

Method: IGD uses predicted noise during the diffusion process to identify NSFW content, based on semantic cues differentiating NSFW from benign prompts.

Result: IGD achieves 91.32% average detection accuracy across seven NSFW categories, outperforming seven baseline methods.

Conclusion: IGD is a simple yet effective approach for in-generation NSFW detection in diffusion-based text-to-image models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [21] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGFC is a novel framework for DGSS that hierarchically calibrates VFM features from coarse to fine granularity, improving robustness to domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGSS methods focus on global feature fine-tuning, neglecting hierarchical adaptation crucial for dense prediction.

Method: MGFC performs coarse-to-fine feature alignment: global contextual semantics (coarse), category-level discriminability (medium), and spatial detail enhancement (fine).

Result: MGFC outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity adaptation effectively transfers VFM generalization strengths to DGSS, enhancing semantic segmentation under domain shifts.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

*Xuyi Yang,Wenhao Zhang,Hongbo Jin,Lin Liu,Hongbo Xu,Yongwei Nie,Fei Yu,Fei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneQA and the LVSQA dataset to improve MLLMs' long video understanding, proposing the SLFG method for efficient scene-based reasoning without modifying model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to resource constraints and inefficient frame processing, lacking alignment with real-world needs.

Method: Proposes SLFG, a method combining frames into coherent scenes using scene localization and dynamic reassembly, enhancing MLLMs' capabilities.

Result: SLFG significantly improves MLLMs' performance in long video benchmarks, demonstrating plug-and-play usability.

Conclusion: The SceneQA task and SLFG method address practical challenges in long video understanding, offering a scalable solution with promising results.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

*Liheng Zhang,Weihao Yu,Zubo Lu,Haozhi Gu,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-3DGS reduces storage costs in 3D Gaussian Splatting by learning importance scores for pruning and compressing Gaussians, achieving 66x compression without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for compressing Gaussian models in 3D Gaussian Splatting fail to identify insignificant Gaussians, degrading pruning, compression, and rendering quality.

Method: SA-3DGS learns importance scores for pruning, uses importance-aware clustering for compression, and employs a codebook repair module to maintain rendering quality.

Result: Achieves up to 66x compression while preserving or improving rendering quality, outperforming other pruning-based methods.

Conclusion: SA-3DGS offers efficient storage reduction and quality maintenance, with strong generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MoCA, a Video Diffusion Model with Mixture of Cross-Attention, improves ID-preserving text-to-video generation by enhancing identity consistency and fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained facial dynamics and temporal identity coherence in T2V generation.

Method: MoCA uses a Diffusion Transformer backbone with Mixture of Cross-Attention, Hierarchical Temporal Pooling, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts, plus a Latent Video Perceptual Loss.

Result: MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% in Face similarity on the CelebIPVid dataset.

Conclusion: MoCA effectively addresses identity consistency and fine-grained dynamics in T2V generation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in cross-video understanding, such as connecting video streams and managing multi-source information retrieval.

Method: Uses person-anchored features, hierarchical spanning trees, and multi-agent reasoning to analyze cross-video queries without end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization/reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: VideoForest sets a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying video streams through person-level features, enabling efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, lacking applicability to multi-human interactions.

Method: An automatic pipeline collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos, resulting in a 12-hour dataset with fine-grained annotations. The CovOG model integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder and Interactive Audio Driver.

Result: The dataset and model demonstrate feasibility for generating realistic multi-human talking videos.

Conclusion: MIT serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in multi-human talking video generation.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceMat introduces a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework for occlusion-aware face matting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world video scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face filters degrade under occlusions; this work aims to improve performance by separating occluding elements from facial regions.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline with a teacher-student model, using NLL loss and knowledge distillation, focusing on ambiguous regions.

Result: FaceMat outperforms existing methods, enhancing visual quality and robustness in unconstrained video scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time applications, supported by the new CelebAMat dataset, and improves face filter performance.

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM is a complementary learning framework for modality-agnostic semantic segmentation, preserving modality strengths while aligning content implicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods homogenize modalities, diluting their strengths and complementarity. CHARM aims for cooperative harmonization.

Method: Uses Mutual Perception Unit (MPU) for implicit alignment and a dual-path optimization strategy (CoL and InE).

Result: Outperforms baselines, especially on fragile modalities, across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Shifts focus from homogenization to harmonization, enabling true cross-modal complementarity.

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains in Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10 metrics on three common UDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID is an advanced, effective solution for UDA in Person ReID, ensuring clarity and high accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: SSFMamba, a Mamba-based network, integrates spatial and frequency domain features for 3D medical image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook unique frequency domain properties and fail to address data distribution differences, limiting global context modeling in 3D segmentation.

Method: SSFMamba uses a dual-branch architecture with Mamba blocks to fuse spatial and frequency domain features, enhancing global context and local details. A 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism improves fusion.

Result: SSFMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets across various metrics.

Conclusion: SSFMamba effectively leverages frequency domain properties and Mamba's capabilities to improve 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward 3DGS methods assume clean input images, but real-world conditions degrade reconstruction quality. RobustGS addresses this by enhancing multi-view feature robustness.

Method: Proposes RobustGS with a Generalized Degradation Learner for degradation-awareness and a semantic-aware state-space model to enhance corrupted inputs and aggregate cross-view information.

Result: RobustGS consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various degradations when integrated into existing methods.

Conclusion: RobustGS provides a plug-and-play solution to improve 3DGS robustness under adverse conditions, advancing real-world applicability.

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

*Zaiying Zhao,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores fairness in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) beyond traditional demographic attributes, revealing biases influenced by cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored fairness concerns in LVLMs across a broader range of attributes, moving beyond race and gender.

Method: Construct an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes using LLMs and evaluate LVLM fairness across finer-grained attributes.

Result: LVLMs show biased outputs across diverse attributes, with cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors impacting decisions more than demographics.

Conclusion: Fairness in LVLMs requires broader attribute consideration, as non-demographic factors significantly influence bias.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

*Bo Zhang,Xu Xinan,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes $C^2Aug$ for MIL-based WSI classification, enhancing pseudo-bag diversity and addressing performance issues with contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-bag augmentation lacks diversity, limiting performance, especially in cases with small tumor areas.

Method: Introduces $C^2Aug$ to sample instances from all same-class bags and a contrastive learning framework to improve feature discrimination.

Result: $C^2Aug$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves diversity and performance in WSI classification.

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Jiantao Tan,Peixian Ma,Kanghao Chen,Zhiming Dai,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for continual learning in medical image classification uses visual concepts from LLMs and a cross-modal attention module to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for continual learning in medical image classification rely on simplistic textual templates, missing richer semantic information.

Method: The framework dynamically builds a visual concept pool with similarity filtering and integrates concepts via a cross-modal image-concept attention module and attention loss.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on medical and natural image datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages semantic guidance from LLMs, proving superior for continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

*Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR improves multimodal video reasoning by addressing data inefficiency, vanishing advantages, and uniform credit assignment via off-policy training and Temporal Advantage Shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of existing methods like GRPO, which suffer from data inefficiency, vanishing advantages, and poor credit assignment.

Method: AVATAR uses off-policy training for better sample efficiency and Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS) for improved credit assignment.

Result: Outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni by +5.4 on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, with 35% higher sample efficiency.

Conclusion: AVATAR effectively addresses key challenges in multimodal video reasoning, delivering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

### [36] [Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03102)
*Tianjiao Jiang,Zhen Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Javen Qinfeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a framework for few-shot learning that disentangles CLIP's visual features using ICA, enhancing cross-modal alignment and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods rely on entangled representations, making adaptation difficult. CCA addresses this by leveraging CLIP's disentangled features and improving alignment.

Method: CCA uses ICA for unsupervised disentanglement of CLIP features and enhances alignment via fine-tuning and cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: CCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets, showing robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: CCA effectively improves few-shot learning by disentangling and aligning multimodal representations, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

*Heng Jia,Linchao Zhu,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H3R is a hybrid framework combining volumetric latent fusion and attention-based feature aggregation for generalizable 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between geometric precision (explicit methods) and robustness (implicit methods) in multi-view correspondence modeling.

Method: Integrates a latent volume for geometric consistency and a camera-aware Transformer for adaptive correspondence refinement using Plücker coordinates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2x faster convergence and significant PSNR improvements on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU datasets.

Conclusion: H3R resolves the mismatch between semantic and spatial reconstruction, supporting high-resolution inputs and robust cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

*Sai Ma,Zhuang Li,John A Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Landsat30-AU, a vision-language dataset for satellite imagery, addressing gaps in existing datasets by including long-term, low-resolution, multi-satellite data. It evaluates VLMs' performance and shows improvements through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize Earth observation by enabling natural language interaction with satellite imagery, especially for long-term, low-resolution, and multi-satellite archives like Landsat, which are overlooked in current datasets.

Method: Created Landsat30-AU, a dataset with image-caption pairs and VQA samples, curated using a bootstrapped pipeline with iterative refinement and human verification. Evaluated eight VLMs and fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the dataset.

Result: Off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on satellite imagery. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B improved captioning (0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr) and VQA accuracy (0.74 to 0.87).

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU fills a critical gap in satellite imagery datasets, and fine-tuning VLMs on it significantly enhances performance, demonstrating its utility for Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

*Arion Zimmermann,Soon-Jo Chung,Fred Hadaegh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFFEE is a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids, addressing biases from shadows and outperforming classical and deep learning methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation of unknown space bodies is critical but challenged by shadows and computational constraints of existing methods.

Method: COFFEE uses sun phase angle data to detect shadow-invariant features, combining Sparse and Graph Neural Networks for feature matching.

Result: The pipeline is bias-free, more accurate than classical methods, and significantly faster than deep learning alternatives.

Conclusion: COFFEE offers a robust, efficient solution for real-time pose estimation in space missions.

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of annotated fire-related data for building units, crucial for tasks like fire early warning and emergency rescue.

Method: Use drone-captured images with real multi-story backgrounds, apply motion blur and brightness adjustments, simulate drone conditions, and generate fire effects using large models.

Result: A dataset of 1,978 images covering diverse building scenarios, enhancing generalization in fire unit detection.

Conclusion: The dataset provides scalable, multi-scenario data, reducing risks and costs of real fire data collection, and is publicly available.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniEdit-I, a training-free framework for enabling image editing in unified vision-language models (VLMs) through iterative understanding, editing, and verifying steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of enabling image editing in unified VLMs while maintaining their strong understanding capabilities.

Method: Proposes a three-step iterative process: understanding (semantic analysis and prompt modification), editing (time-adaptive offset for coherent edits), and verifying (alignment checks and feedback).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark using BLIP3-o.

Conclusion: UniEdit-I successfully enables high-fidelity image editing in unified VLMs without additional training, demonstrating its potential for future VLM development.

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

*Yanshu Wang,Xichen Xu,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARD introduces a diffusion-based framework for anomaly synthesis with spatial control and regional fidelity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing robustness of industrial anomaly detection by improving spatial controllability and regional fidelity in anomaly synthesis.

Method: Uses Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) to freeze background and update foreground anomalies, and Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) for joint global-local evaluation.

Result: SARD achieves superior segmentation accuracy and visual quality on MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets.

Conclusion: SARD sets a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

*Liangyang Ouyang,Jiafeng Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LORE is a training-free, efficient image editing method that optimizes inverted noise to address semantic bias in text-driven editing, outperforming baselines in semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods suffer from semantic bias toward the source concept, suppressing attention to the target concept, especially for dissimilar semantics.

Method: LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise without architectural changes or fine-tuning, improving generalization and controllability.

Result: LORE significantly outperforms baselines on benchmarks (PIEBench, SmartEdit, GapEdit) in semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity.

Conclusion: Latent-space optimization via LORE enables stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, demonstrating scalability for image editing.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

*Junyoung Lim,Jaewoo Ahn,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartCap introduces a large-scale dataset for chart captioning, addressing issues like extraneous info and lack of structural detail, with a novel metric and improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart datasets lack quality and focus, often including irrelevant info and missing key insights, making accurate captioning difficult.

Method: A four-stage pipeline generates dense captions from chart data, verified via cycle consistency. A new Visual Consistency Score evaluates caption quality.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ChartCap produce more accurate, informative captions with fewer hallucinations, outperforming other models and human annotations.

Conclusion: ChartCap improves chart captioning by providing high-quality data and a robust evaluation metric, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs face hallucination issues with stylized images. A new dataset and method (SAVER) are introduced to address this, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LVLMs limits real-world use, especially with stylized images in critical scenarios like gaming, art, and medicine.

Method: Constructed a dataset of photographic and stylized images, benchmarked 13 LVLMs, and proposed SAVER for dynamic output adjustment.

Result: Stylized images cause more hallucinations. SAVER outperforms in mitigating hallucinations across models and tasks.

Conclusion: SAVER effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs for stylized images, enhancing their applicability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware

*Weihang Liu,Yuke Li,Yuxuan Li,Jingyi Yu,Xin Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Duplex-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by using a dual-hierarchy framework and OIT for faster, artifact-free rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are inefficient due to costly alpha-blending and sorting, limiting performance on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Duplex-GS integrates proxy Gaussians with OIT, introduces cell proxies for local management, and uses cell search rasterization.

Result: Achieves 1.5-4x speedup over OIT-based methods, reduces radix sort overhead by 52.2%-86.9%, and eliminates artifacts.

Conclusion: Duplex-GS enhances rendering efficiency and quality, validating OIT's advantages in Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

TL;DR: A novel monocular depth estimation method combining local and global cues via GLKAM and GBPM modules, outperforming existing approaches on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inherent ambiguity in monocular depth estimation due to ill-posed 3D structure recovery from a single view.

Method: Proposes Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) for multi-scale local cues and Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM) for global depth distribution.

Result: Achieves competitive performance, outperforming existing methods on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed components (GLKAM and GBPM) effectively improve depth estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

### [49] [Unifying Locality of KANs and Feature Drift Compensation for Data-free Continual Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03189)
*Tianshuo Zhang,Siran Peng,Li Gao,Haoyuan Zhang,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes KAN-CFD, a framework for continual face forgery detection, addressing catastrophic forgetting using KANs with domain-grouping and feature separation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face forgery detectors degrade on old forgery types when learning new ones (catastrophic forgetting). KANs' local plasticity could help, but they struggle with high-dimensional images and feature overlap.

Method: Introduces KAN-CFD with DG-KD (Domain-Group KAN Detector) for high-dimensional image fitting and FS-KDCP (Feature Separation via KAN Drift Compensation Projection) to prevent input space overlap.

Result: The method achieves superior performance with reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: KAN-CFD effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual face forgery detection, leveraging KANs' local plasticity while overcoming their limitations.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTG-Net, a novel network for segmenting CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images, addressing challenges like irregular shapes and imaging artifacts. It also releases the first public CNV dataset (CNVSeg).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate CNV segmentation in OCTA images is crucial for wet AMD assessment, but existing methods face challenges like irregular shapes, artifacts, and lack of public datasets.

Method: MTG-Net integrates region and vessel morphological information using a multi-task framework and graph-based modules (MIGR and MRGR) for higher-order reasoning. An uncertainty-weighted loss mitigates noise impact.

Result: MTG-Net achieves Dice scores of 87.21% for region segmentation and 88.12% for vessel segmentation, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MTG-Net effectively addresses CNV segmentation challenges, offering improved accuracy and a valuable public dataset for future research.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignCAT improves weakly supervised visual grounding by enhancing cross-modal reasoning with coarse and fine-grained alignment modules, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised VG methods struggle with subtle semantic differences in text due to category and attribute ambiguity.

Method: AlignCAT uses a query-based semantic matching framework with coarse-grained (category and global context) and fine-grained (descriptive and word-level features) alignment modules.

Result: AlignCAT outperforms existing methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks.

Conclusion: AlignCAT effectively addresses ambiguity in weakly supervised VG by leveraging linguistic cues and enhancing contrastive learning.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC improves open-vocabulary HOI detection by integrating interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI detection methods struggle with suboptimal image encoders and ineffective textual encoding, limiting fine-grained interaction detection.

Method: Proposes INP-CC, featuring an interaction-aware prompt generator and language model-guided concept calibration with negative sampling.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

Conclusion: INP-CC enhances HOI detection by focusing on key interaction patterns and refining concept representations.

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield is a new adversarial framework to protect geoprivacy against VLMs like GPT-4o, outperforming existing methods by disentangling features, identifying exposure elements, and optimizing perturbations across resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs can infer locations from public images, threatening geoprivacy. Current adversarial defenses are ineffective for high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets.

Method: GeoShield uses feature disentanglement, exposure element identification, and scale-adaptive enhancement to optimize perturbations globally and locally.

Result: GeoShield outperforms prior methods in black-box settings, offering strong privacy protection without compromising image quality.

Conclusion: GeoShield is the first practical solution to defend against geolocation inference by VLMs, addressing critical privacy concerns.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA), a plug-and-play framework for efficient adversarial defense, achieving SOTA robustness without online adversarial example generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial Training (AT) is costly and degrades standard performance, while existing data augmentation methods are either inefficient or ineffective. A highly efficient and robust defense is needed.

Method: UAA pre-computes a universal transformation offline, decoupling perturbation generation from training, enabling efficient adversarial augmentation during training.

Result: UAA achieves SOTA robustness on multiple benchmarks without the computational overhead of online adversarial example generation.

Conclusion: UAA offers a practical, efficient solution for robust model training, outperforming existing data-augmentation-based defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

*Shanshan Guo,Xiwen Liang,Junfan Lin,Yuzheng Zhuang,Liang Lin,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionSink improves robot manipulation by reformulating actions as self-supervised "action flows" from videos, enhancing precision through iterative refinement and dynamic integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low precision in low-level action estimation limits robot manipulation performance, despite progress in high-level perception and planning.

Method: ActionSink uses two modules: a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher for iterative refinement and a dynamic action flow integrator with a memory pool for historical flow integration.

Result: ActionSink outperforms prior SOTA by 7.9% on LIBERO and achieves an 8% gain on LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: ActionSink advances precise action estimation in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT) improves 3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting by addressing inconsistent 2D masks and refining Gaussians with instance weights and adaptive density control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 2D-to-3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting suffer from inconsistent masks and noisy boundaries due to neglected semantic cues.

Method: Introduces GIT, which uses an instance weight matrix to correct 2D inconsistencies and an adaptive density control mechanism to refine Gaussians.

Result: Produces cleaner 3D assets and sharper segmentation boundaries, improving performance in both online and offline settings.

Conclusion: GIT enables better hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing by enhancing 3D segmentation consistency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer efficient, accessible alternatives to traditional deep learning for automated microscopy image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product

conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and

combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: FFHQ-Makeup is a high-quality synthetic dataset pairing bare and makeup facial images, addressing the lack of realistic paired datasets for beauty-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paired makeup datasets are hard to collect or lack realism, and current synthetic methods distort facial features or identities.

Method: An improved makeup transfer method disentangles identity and makeup, transferring real-world makeup styles onto 18K identities from FFHQ, creating 90K paired images.

Result: FFHQ-Makeup provides 90K high-quality bare-makeup pairs, preserving facial identity and expression.

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap in high-quality paired makeup datasets, aiding future beauty-related research.

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

TL;DR: MVTOP is a transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation, resolving ambiguities by fusing view-specific features early and modeling multi-view geometry via lines of sight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pose ambiguities in single-view or post-processed multi-view methods by leveraging holistic multi-view information.

Method: Early fusion of view-specific features and modeling multi-view geometry using lines of sight from camera centers. Assumes known camera parameters but allows variability per inference.

Result: Outperforms single-view and existing multi-view methods on a synthetic dataset and achieves competitive results on YCB-V.

Conclusion: MVTOP is a versatile, end-to-end trainable method that reliably resolves pose ambiguities without additional data like depth.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Motivation: Event cameras have high temporal resolution and low latency but limited spatial resolution, hindering fine-grained perception tasks.

Method: Uses SNNs with Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding and Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) for efficient super-resolution.

Result: Achieves competitive super-resolution performance with reduced model size and inference time.

Conclusion: The method is suitable for embedding in event cameras or as preprocessing for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or

*Wentao Qu,Guofeng Mei,Jing Wang,Yujiao Wu,Xiaoshui Huang,Liang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSDNet introduces a single-stage sparse 3D object detection method using a detachable latent framework (DLF) of DDPMs, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDPM-based methods for 3D object detection are inefficient due to multi-step iterations. RSDNet aims to address this by enabling single-step detection while maintaining robustness.

Method: RSDNet uses lightweight denoising networks (DAEs) in latent feature spaces, reformulates DDPM noise mechanisms, and introduces semantic-geometric guidance for boundary perception.

Result: RSDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: RSDNet successfully combines efficiency and robustness in 3D object detection, setting a new benchmark for single-stage sparse detection.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

*Jisoo Kim,Wooseok Seo,Junwan Kim,Seungho Park,Sooyeon Park,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ReDPO, a distillation method combining DPO and SFT for efficient text-to-video models, and V.I.P. for dataset curation, achieving significant parameter reduction without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing mode collapse and degraded quality in pruned models due to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in text-to-video (T2V) distillation.

Method: Integrates DPO and SFT for targeted property recovery, introduces V.I.P. for dataset filtering, and uses a step-by-step online training approach.

Result: Achieves 36.2% and 67.5% parameter reduction in VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, maintaining or surpassing full model performance.

Conclusion: ReDPO and V.I.P. enable efficient, high-quality video generation, validated on leading T2V models.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

### [63] [Beyond Isolated Words: Diffusion Brush for Handwritten Text-Line Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03256)
*Gang Dai,Yifan Zhang,Yutao Qin,Qiangya Guo,Shuangping Huang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffBrush is a diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line generation, excelling in style imitation and content accuracy by decoupling style from content and using multi-scale learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on isolated words, but realistic handwritten text requires modeling relationships between words (e.g., alignment, spacing). Generating entire text lines is more comprehensive but challenging.

Method: DiffBrush uses content-decoupled style learning (disentangling style via column- and row-wise masking) and multi-scale content learning (line and word discriminators for coherence and accuracy).

Result: DiffBrush generates high-quality text lines, excelling in style reproduction and content preservation.

Conclusion: DiffBrush addresses the challenges of handwritten text-line generation effectively, offering superior performance in style and content accuracy.

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Yuheng Ji,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPrompt, a prompt learning-based framework, enhances egocentric action recognition by unifying verb and noun component representations through a prompt pool and attention-based fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat verb and noun components independently, ignoring their semantic relationships, leading to fragmented representations and poor generalization.

Method: EgoPrompt uses a Unified Prompt Pool and attention-based fusion to interact verb and noun representations, with a Diverse Pool Criteria for training.

Result: EgoPrompt outperforms benchmarks on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets in within-dataset, cross-dataset, and generalization tasks.

Conclusion: EgoPrompt effectively addresses the limitations of independent component treatment, improving generalization and performance in egocentric action recognition.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmmPD is a multimodal framework for placental disease diagnosis using WSIs, addressing patch selection and global context loss with a two-stage patch selection and hybrid fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of placental diseases is crucial to prevent complications, but existing WSI methods face computational and contextual challenges.

Method: Introduces a two-stage patch selection module and hybrid multimodal fusion with adaptive graph learning and textual reports.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-constructed and public datasets.

Conclusion: EmmPD effectively balances efficiency and feature preservation, improving placental disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

*Jun Luo,Zijing Zhao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDGPA introduces a method for zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation using synthetic data generation and progressive adaptation to handle distribution shifts without target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of deep learning models in handling distribution shifts between training and test data, especially when no target images are available.

Method: Utilizes a text-to-image diffusion model to generate synthetic target-style images, crops and edits small patches for spatial precision, and employs progressive adaptation with an intermediate domain.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SDGPA effectively tackles domain adaptation challenges with synthetic data and progressive learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaroPoser combines IMU and barometric data from smartphones and smartwatches to improve human pose estimation and global translation on uneven terrain, outperforming IMU-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based methods struggle with pose estimation accuracy on uneven terrain due to sparse sensor data and lack of datasets.

Method: BaroPoser integrates IMU and barometric data, estimates height changes via barometric readings, and uses a local thigh coordinate frame for better motion representation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art IMU-only approaches in both public benchmarks and real-world recordings.

Conclusion: BaroPoser demonstrates the effectiveness of combining IMU and barometric data for accurate human pose estimation on non-flat terrain.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving object detection efficiency for resource-constrained devices by adapting KD, despite challenges like dual objectives and feature imbalance.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy for KD methods in object detection, categorizing CNN and Transformer-based approaches, and evaluates them on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets.

Result: Comparative analysis of KD methods using mAP@0.5 metric, highlighting effectiveness and challenges.

Conclusion: The taxonomy clarifies KD's role in object detection, identifies challenges, and guides future research for efficient systems.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Result: Achieves >85% real-time accuracy on a dataset of five gestures from seven users.

Conclusion: First work to use bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and event-driven processing for radar-based HGR, reducing power and computation.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based

Motivation: The increasing use of UAVs necessitates reliable long-range detection, but existing datasets lack diversity and range-specific data.

Method: The authors expanded the LRDDv1 dataset to create LRDDv2, adding more diverse images and range information for improved drone detection and range estimation.

Result: LRDDv2 offers a comprehensive resource with 39,516 annotated images, including range data for 8,000+ images, aiding long-range detection research.

Conclusion: LRDDv2 addresses gaps in drone detection datasets, providing valuable data for developing advanced detection and range estimation algorithms.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a planning-then-populating framework (MMPL) for long video generation, addressing temporal drift and parallelization issues in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive diffusion models struggle with long temporal durations due to error accumulation and lack of parallelization.

Method: MMPL uses hierarchical Micro and Macro Planning to sketch a global storyline and generate high-quality video segments in parallel.

Result: The method outperforms existing models in quality and stability for long video generation.

Conclusion: MMPL effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive models, enabling efficient and consistent long video synthesis.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated

TL;DR: A dual-stage method for detail recovery in dark images uses a Residual Fourier-Guided Module for global illumination and Mamba modules for texture refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enhancement methods fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges in dark images, limiting their effectiveness in applications like text and edge detection.

Method: Proposes a dual-stage approach: (1) RFGM for global illumination in the frequency domain, (2) Patch Mamba and Grad Mamba for texture refinement and edge reconstruction.

Result: Significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency, as demonstrated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The lightweight modules enhance detail recovery and can be integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFP reduces token cost in Video-QA by pruning redundant frames and adding a lightweight semantic graph, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High token cost and context dilution from excessive frames hinder MLLMs in Video-QA.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP) using hierarchical clustering on fused features and a semantic graph for context.

Result: Reduces frames by 86.9% and tokens by 83.2%, often improving accuracy.

Conclusion: AFP enhances efficiency and performance in Video-QA by addressing redundancy and context loss.

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: CIVQLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement using discrete representation learning and causal intervention to address distribution shifts and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLIE methods lack interpretability or rely on unreliable priors, while physics-based methods fail in complex scenarios. CIVQLLIE aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses Vector Quantization (VQ) to map features to a discrete codebook, with multi-level causal intervention (PCI, FCI, LSAG) to correct distribution shifts and HDRM for detail reconstruction.

Result: The framework aligns degraded inputs with the codebook, enhances generalization, and reconstructs fine details effectively.

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE provides a robust and interpretable solution for low-light image enhancement, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

*Junlong Ren,Gangjian Zhang,Honghao Fu,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaMo, a wavelet-based framework, improves text-motion retrieval by capturing part-specific and time-varying motion details, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the complexities of 3D motion-text alignment due to overlooking body part dynamics and spatial-temporal details.

Method: WaMo uses wavelet decomposition, reconstruction, and disordered sequence prediction to extract discriminative motion features for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Achieves 17.0% and 18.2% improvements in Rsum on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, surpassing SOTA.

Conclusion: WaMo effectively addresses motion-text alignment challenges, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Yufei Xue,Yushi Huang,Jiawei Shao,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMQ introduces an importance-aware PTQ framework for VLMs, addressing modality discrepancy and token redundancy, achieving SOTA performance under low-bit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hessian-based PTQ methods for LLMs treat all tokens equally, causing performance drops in VLMs due to modality discrepancy (limited text vs. redundant vision tokens).

Method: VLMQ optimizes an importance-aware objective for enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, using a lightweight block-wise backward pass for efficiency.

Result: VLMQ achieves a 16.45% improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization, demonstrating SOTA performance across 8 benchmarks for VLMs.

Conclusion: VLMQ effectively addresses VLMs' unique challenges, offering a robust solution for low-bit PTQ with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPromo is a federated learning framework that efficiently adapts large foundation models to new domains using lightweight proxy models, reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FL approaches struggle with large models due to high computational demands on client devices. FedPromo addresses this by optimizing lightweight proxies.

Method: FedPromo uses a two-stage process: server-side knowledge distillation aligns representations of a large model with a compact one, followed by local classifier training on clients.

Result: FedPromo outperforms existing methods on five image classification benchmarks, especially for limited-resource clients.

Conclusion: FedPromo balances performance, privacy, and efficiency, enabling decentralized multi-domain learning without direct user data access.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), an efficient all-in-one image restoration method using one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion models, outperforming existing approaches in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) using diffusion models are costly and lack adaptability to diverse degradation types.

Method: Introduces multi-degradation feature modulation and parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models, plus a detail enhancement module.

Result: DOD achieves superior restoration performance with one-step sampling, excelling in visual quality and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DOD is a highly efficient and adaptable solution for AiOIR, leveraging Stable Diffusion with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

*Keyi Li,Alexander Jaus,Jens Kleesiek,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP enhances pathology segmentation by integrating anatomical context without retraining, achieving top performance on PET/CT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches ignore anatomical context in pathology segmentation, limiting accuracy. GRASP bridges this gap.

Method: GRASP uses pseudolabel integration and feature alignment to leverage anatomy segmentation models, avoiding auxiliary training.

Result: GRASP ranks top across metrics and architectures, with its dual anatomy injection strategy proving effective.

Conclusion: GRASP successfully integrates anatomical context into pathology segmentation, improving performance without additional training.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

*Jingjie Wang,Shunli Zhang,Xiang Wei,Senmao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitAdapter introduces a continual learning approach for gait recognition, avoiding retraining pitfalls by using graph neural networks and a Euclidean Distance Stability Method to preserve knowledge across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait recognition models struggle with retaining knowledge from previous datasets when retrained, leading to performance drops.

Method: Proposes GaitAdapter with GPAK module (graph neural networks) and EDSN (Euclidean Distance Stability Method) to aggregate and stabilize gait patterns.

Result: GaitAdapter effectively retains knowledge from diverse tasks and outperforms other methods in discriminative capability.

Conclusion: GaitAdapter offers a robust solution for continual gait recognition, enhancing performance and knowledge retention across tasks.

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAVIA improves Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for Vision Transformers (ViT) by neutralizing token aggregation via information augmentation, reducing latency by 20% while outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods for ViTs are computationally expensive and suffer performance degradation when integrated with token aggregation, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: NAVIA augments the [CLS] token embedding and incorporates adaptive biases in shallow ViT layers, optimizing via entropy minimization to recover lost information from token aggregation.

Result: NAVIA achieves a 20% reduction in inference latency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: NAVIA effectively addresses the Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA) challenge by balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

*Xinzhu Li,Juepeng Zheng,Yikun Chen,Xudong Mao,Guanghui Yue,Wei Zhou,Chenlei Lv,Ruomei Wang,Fan Zhou,Baoquan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthGait introduces RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for robust gait recognition, outperforming existing methods with a novel fusion scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D representations (silhouettes, skeletons) lack sufficient cues for viewpoint variations and finer gait details, prompting the need for richer modalities like depth maps.

Method: DepthGait estimates depth maps from RGB sequences and combines them with silhouettes, using a multi-scale, cross-level fusion scheme to bridge modality gaps.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with high rank-1 accuracy on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: DepthGait's integration of depth maps and silhouettes significantly improves gait recognition, demonstrating the value of multi-modal approaches.

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow proposes a flow-matching framework to merge style and content invertibly, enabling natural disentanglement without explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in disentangling style and content due to semantic overlap and human subjectivity. Existing methods struggle with ambiguity.

Method: SCFlow uses flow matching to learn bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations, avoiding restrictive priors. A synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples was used for training.

Result: SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings, achieving competitive performance. Disentanglement emerges naturally.

Conclusion: Explicit disentanglement is bypassed by invertible merging, demonstrating that disentanglement can emerge naturally from well-defined tasks.

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral unmixing method (STVMLU) combines sparsity and total variation constraints with multilayer matrix factorization, outperforming existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of hyperspectral unmixing by incorporating spatial similarity and sparsity constraints.

Method: Uses a multilayer matrix factorization model with TV and L1/2-norm constraints, optimized via ADMM.

Result: Enhanced performance in unmixing compared to other methods.

Conclusion: STVMLU effectively improves hyperspectral unmixing accuracy by leveraging spatial and sparsity constraints.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

TL;DR: MACT is a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework for visual document understanding and VQA, outperforming existing VLMs with smaller parameters and robust self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack robust self-correction and struggle with long visual contexts and complex reasoning, especially in document-based tasks.

Method: MACT uses four specialized agents (planning, execution, judgment, answer) with mixed reward modeling and hybrid test-time scaling.

Result: MACT leads in 13 of 15 benchmarks, excelling in long-context and complex reasoning tasks, with smaller parameters.

Conclusion: MACT demonstrates superior performance in document-based and general tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

TL;DR: SlotMatch is a simple knowledge distillation framework for unsupervised video segmentation, transferring object-centric representations to a lightweight student model without extra objectives. It matches or outperforms the teacher model while being more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised video segmentation lacks supervisory signals and often requires complex models. SlotMatch aims to simplify this by distilling knowledge into a lightweight student.

Method: SlotMatch aligns teacher and student slots via cosine similarity, avoiding additional losses or supervision.

Result: The student model matches or outperforms the teacher (SlotContrast) with 3.6x fewer parameters and 1.9x faster speed, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: SlotMatch demonstrates efficient knowledge distillation for unsupervised video segmentation, achieving high performance with simplicity and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better approximate real data distributions in image translation by capturing fine-grained local semantics and structural coherence.

Method: Uses Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision with distribution-based loss metrics (KL/JS divergence, log-based similarity).

Result: Superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, especially in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Frequency-guided latent learning enhances generalization, with applications in document restoration, style transfer, and medical image synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-modal medical knowledge graph (M3KG) using GPT-4o to enhance X-ray report generation, addressing issues like hallucination and weak disease diagnosis. It employs R-GCN, Swin-Transformer, and cross-attention for feature extraction and interaction, validated by extensive experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of X-ray medical report generation by addressing persistent challenges like hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capabilities using large foundation models and multi-modal knowledge graphs.

Method: Constructs M3KG with GPT-4o, samples multi-granularity semantic graphs, uses R-GCN for feature extraction, Swin-Transformer for vision features, and cross-attention for knowledge interaction. A Q-former retrieves disease-aware vision tokens, and an LLM maps inputs to language descriptions.

Result: The proposed framework, validated on multiple datasets, effectively improves X-ray report generation, leveraging M3KG and advanced feature extraction techniques.

Conclusion: The M3KG and the proposed framework significantly enhance X-ray report generation, with plans to release the source code for further research.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

*Hongjun Liu,Chao Yao,Yalan Zhang,Xiaokun wang,Xiaojuan Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAC is a self-supervised framework for EEG signal classification that addresses cross-domain data shifts using channel-dependent masks and spatial imputation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signal classification is hindered by data distribution shifts from heterogeneous electrode configurations and hardware discrepancies. IMAC aims to standardize and align cross-domain EEG data.

Method: IMAC uses a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping, channel-dependent masks, and spatio-temporal signal alignment to simulate cross-domain variations. It also employs a disentangled structure for temporal and spatial modeling.

Result: IMAC achieves top classification accuracy in cross-subject and cross-center scenarios, with up to 35% improvement in integrity scores over baselines.

Conclusion: IMAC effectively addresses EEG data shifts, offering robust and adaptable classification performance under diverse conditions.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

### [91] [MedCAL-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark on Cold-Start Active Learning with Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03441)
*Ning Zhu,Xiaochuan Ma,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedCAL-Bench is the first FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical image analysis, evaluating 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets. It highlights the effectiveness of FMs, especially DINO for segmentation, and varying performance of sample selection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of SSL in CSAL for medical image analysis by leveraging pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) and establishing a benchmark for comparison.

Method: Proposes MedCAL-Bench, evaluating 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: 1) Most FMs are effective for CSAL, with DINO excelling in segmentation. 2) FM performance varies more in segmentation than classification. 3) ALPS and RepDiv are top strategies for segmentation and classification, respectively.

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation of FMs and CSAL strategies, demonstrating their potential and guiding future research in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

### [92] [RAAG: Ratio Aware Adaptive Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03442)
*Shangwen Zhu,Qianyu Peng,Yuting Hu,Zhantao Yang,Han Zhang,Zhao Pu,Ruili Feng,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an instability in flow-based generative models due to early-step sensitivity to guidance scale, proposes a RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule, and demonstrates its effectiveness in faster sampling without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how classifier-free guidance interacts with sampling stages in flow-based models, especially in fast, low-step regimes, to improve stability and performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the RATIO spike in early steps, leading to a proposed adaptive guidance schedule using exponential decay to dampen guidance scale.

Result: The method enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment across image and video models.

Conclusion: Stepwise guidance adaptation is crucial for optimizing fast flow-based generative models, with the proposed schedule offering a lightweight, effective solution.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

### [93] [CoPS: Conditional Prompt Synthesis for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03447)
*Qiyu Chen,Zhen Qu,Wei Luo,Haiming Yao,Yunkang Cao,Yuxin Jiang,Yinan Duan,Huiyuan Luo,Chengkan Lv,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPS improves zero-shot anomaly detection by synthesizing dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) struggle with static tokens and sparse textual labels, limiting generalization and causing overfitting.

Method: Proposes Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), which synthesizes dynamic prompts using visual features, normal/anomaly prototypes, and a variational autoencoder for semantic fusion.

Result: CoPS achieves a 2.5% AUROC improvement over state-of-the-art methods across 13 industrial and medical datasets.

Conclusion: CoPS effectively addresses limitations of static prompts and sparse labels, enhancing ZSAD performance.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

### [94] [Video Demoireing using Focused-Defocused Dual-Camera System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03449)
*Xuan Dong,Xiangyuan Sun,Xia Wang,Jian Song,Ya Li,Weixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera framework is proposed to address moire patterns in videos by leveraging synchronized focused and defocused captures, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demoireing methods struggle to distinguish moire patterns from real textures and maintain tonal/temporal consistency.

Method: Uses dual-camera synchronized videos (focused and defocused), optical flow alignment, multi-scale CNN, and joint bilateral filtering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art demoireing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The dual-camera approach effectively addresses moire artifacts while preserving texture and consistency.

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

### [95] [AVPDN: Learning Motion-Robust and Scale-Adaptive Representations for Video-Based Polyp Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03458)
*Zilin Chen,Shengnan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVPDN is a novel framework for polyp detection in colonoscopy videos, addressing challenges like rapid camera movement and noise with adaptive feature and multi-scale integration modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate polyp detection is crucial for early colorectal cancer diagnosis, but colonoscopy videos' rapid camera movement and noise complicate this task.

Method: AVPDN uses AFIA for feature enhancement (dense/sparse self-attention, channel shuffle) and SACI for multi-scale context integration (dilated convolutions).

Result: AVPDN achieves competitive performance on public benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in video-based polyp detection.

Conclusion: AVPDN's adaptive and multi-scale approach effectively addresses challenges in colonoscopy video analysis, improving polyp detection accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

### [96] [IKOD: Mitigating Visual Attention Degradation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03469)
*Jiabing Yang,Chenhang Cui,Yiyang Zhou,Yixiang Chen,Peng Xia,Ying Wei,Tao Yu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by proposing IKOD, a method that merges key-value logits from shorter sequences to improve image attention and reduce hallucinations without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with integrating vision and language, leading to hallucinations that worsen with longer sequences. The cause is unclear, but diminishing visual attention is hypothesized as a key factor.

Method: The authors propose IKOD, a collaborative decoding strategy that merges logits from shorter, high-attention sequences with original decoding to maintain image focus and reduce hallucinations.

Result: IKOD effectively mitigates hallucinations and enhances LVLM performance without additional training or high computational costs, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: IKOD is a lightweight, efficient solution for reducing hallucinations in LVLMs by addressing attention degradation, applicable across various models without extra resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

### [97] [VideoGuard: Protecting Video Content from Unauthorized Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03480)
*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGuard is a method to protect videos from unauthorized editing by introducing subtle perturbations that disrupt generative diffusion models, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of generative models for malicious video editing highlights the need for robust protection methods, as current solutions are inadequate for videos.

Method: VideoGuard uses joint frame optimization and integrates video motion information to create perturbations that disrupt generative models, ensuring implausible outputs.

Result: VideoGuard outperforms baseline methods in protecting videos from unauthorized editing, validated by objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: VideoGuard effectively bridges the gap in video content protection, offering a superior solution against malicious generative model misuse.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

*Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrUM introduces a transformer-based adapter for personalized T2I generation, improving accuracy by leveraging condition-level modeling in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on prompt-level modeling, which limits personalization due to token capacity constraints in T2I diffusion models.

Method: DrUM integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter for condition-level modeling in latent space.

Result: DrUM shows strong performance on large datasets and works with open-source text encoders without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DrUM enhances personalized generation in T2I models by addressing prompt-level limitations.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

*Dasol Choi Jihwan Lee,Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SODA, a framework to measure demographic biases in text-to-image models, revealing stereotypes in generated objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate subtle demographic biases in object generation, beyond human depictions, and propose a systematic auditing method.

Method: SODA compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues vs. neutral prompts across 2,700 images from three models.

Result: Strong associations between demographic groups and visual attributes were found, reflecting stereotypes and subtle biases. Some models showed less diversity, amplifying disparities.

Conclusion: SODA provides a practical tool for auditing biases in generative models, aiding responsible AI development.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT introduces Twin-Log Quantization and Adaptive Rotation Scheme to address low-bit quantization challenges in Diffusion Transformers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost and large parameter sizes of DiTs hinder resource-constrained usage, and existing PTQ methods degrade performance under low-bit settings.

Method: Proposes LRQ-DiT with Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ) for weights and Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) for activations to mitigate outliers and improve quantization.

Result: LRQ-DiT achieves better performance than baselines on PixArt, FLUX, COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets, preserving image quality.

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT effectively addresses low-bit quantization challenges for DiTs, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

TL;DR: ParticleSAM adapts a segmentation foundation model for small, dense objects in construction material images, validated by a new dataset and outperforming the original SAM method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality monitoring of recycled construction materials is inefficient; vision-based ML can automate this but lacks methods for dense, small-particle images.

Method: Proposes ParticleSAM, an adaptation of a segmentation foundation model, and creates a dense multi-particle dataset using an automated data generation pipeline.

Result: ParticleSAM outperforms the original SAM method in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: ParticleSAM offers a promising solution for small-particle segmentation, applicable beyond construction, with validated performance.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Mohammadsadegh Khoshghiaferezaee,Moritz Krauth,Shima Shabani,Michael Breuß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores sparsity in sparse dictionary learning (SDL) for image recovery, showing that high sparsity doesn't compromise quality and varies by optimization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the balance between enforcing sparsity in SDL and maintaining recovery quality, especially across different optimization methods.

Method: Analyzes sparsity regimes in SDL solutions using various iterative shrinkage optimization methods.

Result: Different methods yield varying sparsity levels, but high sparsity generally doesn't harm recovery quality, even with dissimilar training data.

Conclusion: High sparsity in SDL is viable without quality loss, with sparsity regimes dependent on the optimization method used.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework to improve cross-modal retrieval in medical data by addressing ambiguity and variability. It achieves state-of-the-art results with up to 10.17% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with nuanced semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable retrieval results.

Method: PECM uses multi-level prototypes and dual-stream confidence estimation with adaptive weighting to handle uncertainty and enhance robustness.

Result: Significant improvements in retrieval precision and consistency, with up to 10.17% performance gains on various datasets.

Conclusion: PECM effectively addresses data ambiguity and variability, advancing reliability in clinical cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline to create a garment editing dataset (EditGarment) using natural language instructions, addressing the lack of high-quality data and fashion-specific supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Garment editing via natural language is valuable for fashion design but lacks scalable, high-quality instruction-image pairs due to costly manual annotation and imprecise modeling.

Method: The authors define six instruction categories for balanced triplet generation and introduce Fashion Edit Score for semantic-aware evaluation.

Result: They construct 52,257 candidate triplets, refining to 20,596 high-quality ones for the EditGarment dataset.

Conclusion: EditGarment is the first dataset for standalone garment editing, enabling better instruction-based fashion applications.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

*Yazhou Zhu,Haofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free CD-FSMIS model using MAUP strategy adapts SAM for medical image segmentation without additional training, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CD-FSMIS models require heavy training, limiting universality and deployment ease. Leveraging large visual models like SAM offers a solution.

Method: Proposes MAUP: Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting, including K-means clustering prompts, uncertainty-aware selection, and adaptive optimization.

Result: Achieves precise segmentation across three medical datasets without training, outperforming conventional CD-FSMIS and training-free FSMIS models.

Conclusion: MAUP effectively adapts SAM for CD-FSMIS, offering a training-free solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

### [106] [Distribution-aware Knowledge Unification and Association for Non-exemplar Lifelong Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03516)
*Shiben Liu,Mingyue Xu,Huijie Fan,Qiang Wang,Yandong Tang,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DKUA, a framework for Lifelong Person Re-Identification (LReID), addressing knowledge retention and adaptation by focusing on distribution awareness and cross-domain unified learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LReID methods lack specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning, limiting their ability to balance old knowledge preservation and new information adaptation.

Method: DKUA includes domain-style modeling, adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC), unified knowledge association (UKA), and distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) to enhance anti-forgetting and generalization.

Result: DKUA achieves 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement over existing methods in anti-forgetting and generalization.

Conclusion: DKUA effectively addresses LReID challenges by unifying domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

*Stefan Brandstätter,Maximilian Köller,Philipp Seeböck,Alissa Blessing,Felicitas Oberndorfer,Svitlana Pochepnia,Helmut Prosch,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticStitcher uses a histopathology foundation model to automate tissue fragment stitching, outperforming current methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tissue samples often exceed slide size, requiring stitching, which is challenging due to preparation artifacts and distortions.

Method: Uses latent feature representations from a foundation model for semantic matching and robust pose estimation to create whole mount slides.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in boundary matching accuracy across three datasets.

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher provides a robust solution for automated tissue stitching in histopathology.

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

*Kaishen Yuan,Yuting Zhang,Shang Gao,Yijie Zhu,Wenshuo Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoEmoGen is a pipeline for generating emotionally faithful images using high-quality captions and a HiLoRA module, outperforming existing methods in semantic coherence and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with abstract emotions, and existing EICG methods rely on flawed word-level labels. CoEmoGen addresses these issues.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models for emotion-triggering captions and a HiLoRA module to model polarity-shared and emotion-specific features.

Result: CoEmoGen excels in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence, validated by quantitative, qualitative, and user studies.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen offers a scalable solution for EICG, supported by the EmoArt dataset for emotion-driven artistic creation.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

*Inamullah,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the link between serum lipid subclasses and retinal microvascular traits, finding specific associations and supporting retinal imaging as a non-invasive metabolic health marker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between lipidomics and retinal vasculature, which is understudied, and to assess retinal imaging's potential for evaluating systemic health.

Method: Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine connections between lipid subclasses (FA, DAG, TAG, CE) and retinal microvascular traits, with BH-FDR adjustment for significance.

Result: FA correlated with vessel twistiness, CE with vessel widths, while DAG and TAG negatively correlated with arteriole/venule width and complexity.

Conclusion: Retinal vascular traits reflect distinct lipid profiles, highlighting their potential as non-invasive metabolic health indicators.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

*Long Qian,Bingke Zhu,Yingying Chen,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARAS introduces a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis method to improve defect realism and semantic control, integrated with QARAD for enhanced anomaly detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome structural deficiencies in existing anomaly synthesis methods, such as discontinuities and limited controllability.

Method: ARAS uses token-anchored latent editing, a hard-gated auto-regressive operator, and a masked sampling kernel for precise defect injection. QARAD employs dynamic weighting based on image-text similarity.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in anomaly detection, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and 5x faster synthesis than diffusion-based alternatives.

Conclusion: ARAS and QARAD provide superior anomaly synthesis and detection, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale, open-source dataset for converting spoken math expressions to LaTeX, addressing gaps in prior work and achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of converting spoken math to LaTeX is underexplored but crucial for education and research. Prior work lacks scale, multilingual support, and training data.

Method: The authors create a dataset of 66,000 annotated audio samples in English and Russian, using ASR post-correction, audio language models, and few-shot prompting.

Result: Their models outperform MathSpeech by 40+ percentage points on the S2L-equations benchmark and achieve a 40% CER on the new S2L-sentences benchmark.

Conclusion: This work advances multimodal AI for math content recognition and provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

*Stephanie Wohlfahrt,Christoph Praschl,Horst Leitner,Wolfram Jantsch,Julia Konic,Silvio Schueler,Andreas Stöckl,David C. Schedl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drones with thermal and RGB imagery efficiently estimate wildlife density, yielding higher densities than camera traps, offering scalable and non-intrusive monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife density methods (e.g., capture-recapture, camera traps) are labor-intensive or spatially limited. Drones provide a scalable, efficient alternative.

Method: Drones surveyed areas in southeastern Austria during leafless periods, using thermal/RGB imagery and systematic transects. Three extrapolation methods (naive, bootstrapping, zero-inflated negative binomial) estimated densities.

Result: Drone-based estimates were generally higher than camera trap (REM) results, except in one area, reflecting daytime activity in open/forested zones.

Conclusion: Drones are a promising, scalable tool for wildlife density estimation, complementing traditional methods by offering different perspectives.

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

*Muzhaffar Hazman,Susan McKeever,Josephine Griffith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current meme-matching methods, which focus only on template-based memes, and proposes broader approaches, including segment-wise similarity and multimodal models, to improve matching for non-template memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meme-matching methods are limited to template-based memes, excluding many non-template memes and hindering comprehensive analysis and linking to meme dictionaries.

Method: The paper introduces a broader meme-matching formulation, evaluates conventional and segment-wise similarity measures, and explores a prompting-based approach using a multimodal large language model.

Result: Segment-wise similarity outperforms whole-image measures for non-template memes, but accurate matching of memes via shared visual elements remains challenging.

Conclusion: More sophisticated techniques are needed to effectively match memes beyond template-based methods, as current approaches fall short for non-template formats.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

*Annemarie McCarthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline using hierarchical ML (CNN classifiers and segmentation) efficiently extracts building footprints from rural historical maps, validated on Irish Ordnance Survey maps, revealing abandoned settlements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods are computationally intensive and urban-focused, limiting rural historical analysis. This work addresses scalability for sparse rural maps.

Method: Hierarchical ML: CNN classifiers filter out non-building sections, then CNN segmentation extracts building features from high-probability areas.

Result: Validated on Irish maps, the pipeline shows high performance and efficiency, identifying an abandoned settlement in Tully, Co. Galway.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient rural historical map analysis, aiding archaeological discovery, as demonstrated by uncovering a likely Famine-era abandoned settlement.

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

TL;DR: SAM2-UNeXT enhances SAM2-UNet by integrating a DINOv2 encoder and dual-resolution strategy for better segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generalizability and performance of SAM2-UNet for downstream tasks by addressing encoder limitations.

Method: Proposes SAM2-UNeXT with a DINOv2 encoder, dual-resolution strategy, and dense glue layer for simpler yet accurate segmentation.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in tasks like camouflaged object detection and marine animal segmentation.

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT offers a powerful, generalizable solution for segmentation tasks with a simple architecture.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

TL;DR: RadProPoser is a probabilistic encoder-decoder for radar-based human pose estimation, achieving 6.425 cm MPJPE and reliable uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy, multipath-affected radar measurements for privacy-preserving human pose estimation.

Method: Uses variational inference with Gaussian/Laplace priors to predict 3D joint locations and uncertainties from MIMO radar data.

Result: Achieves 6.425 cm MPJPE, calibrated uncertainty (0.021 ECE), and aids activity classification (F1 0.870).

Conclusion: First end-to-end radar HPE system with explainable uncertainty, advancing reliable human motion analysis.

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaScope, a neural network for metalens endoscopy, addressing optical issues like intensity decay and chromatic aberration, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized endoscopy faces limitations with conventional lenses; metalenses offer promise but lack data and algorithm research.

Method: Establishes metalens datasets, proposes MetaScope with Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA) and Chromatic Correction (OCC), and uses gradient-guided distillation.

Result: MetaScope excels in segmentation and restoration, showing strong generalization in biomedical applications.

Conclusion: MetaScope bridges the gap in metalens endoscopy research, offering a robust solution for clinical use.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

TL;DR: DyCAF-Net improves object detection with dynamic class-aware fusion, adaptive attention, and feature modulation, outperforming baselines in precision and mAP across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static fusion and class-agnostic attention in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance.

Method: Introduces input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck, dual dynamic attention, and class-aware feature adaptation.

Result: Significant improvements in precision and mAP across 13 benchmarks, maintaining efficiency and speed.

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net is a robust solution for real-world detection tasks, adaptable to scale variance and class imbalance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions restrict the availability of multi-spectral satellite imagery, while Sentinel-1 radar data is unaffected by these issues.

Method: A novel multi-stage training approach using conditional latent flow matching, integrating cosine scheduling with flow matching for the first time.

Result: Achieved FID score of 0.7432 for optical imagery, and SSIM scores of 0.6156 (NDWI) and 0.6874 (NDVI), indicating high fidelity and structural similarity.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker is a promising solution for remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is often unavailable or unreliable.

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

*Rodrigo Verschae,Ignacio Bugueno-Cordova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces evTransFER, a transfer learning framework for face expression recognition using event-based cameras, achieving a 93.6% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras capture dynamic facial expressions with high precision, but existing methods lack efficiency. Transfer learning can improve recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes evTransFER, a transfer learning framework with a feature extractor trained via adversarial generative methods for facial reconstruction, then transferred to expression recognition. Incorporates LSTM for long-term dynamics and introduces TIE representation.

Result: Achieves 93.6% recognition rate on e-CK+, a 25.9% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: evTransFER significantly enhances facial expression recognition using event-based cameras, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning and novel architectures.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best

specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional methods that decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or require costly per-scene optimization, aiming for scalability and generalizability.

Result: Achieves 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet, enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis, semantic segmentation, and depth prediction in a single pass.

Conclusion: Uni3R introduces a novel paradigm for unified, generalizable 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: OmniShape enables probabilistic pose and full shape estimation from a single observation without prior 3D models or category knowledge, using decoupled multi-modal distributions and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate object pose and shape from a single observation without relying on known 3D models or categories, addressing a gap in current methods.

Method: Decouples shape completion into two multi-modal distributions (measurement projection and object geometry prior) and trains conditional diffusion models for each to sample hypotheses.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on real-world datasets, enabling joint pose and shape estimation.

Conclusion: OmniShape is a pioneering method for probabilistic pose and shape estimation, validated by real-world performance.

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Veila is a conditional diffusion framework for generating controllable panoramic LiDAR data using monocular RGB images, addressing challenges like unreliable conditioning, modality gaps, and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained control or rely on text-guided synthesis, making RGB-based LiDAR generation an open problem due to semantic, depth, and alignment challenges.

Method: Veila integrates Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM), Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA), and Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) to enhance RGB-LiDAR alignment and structural consistency.

Result: Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency on benchmarks like nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, improving downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Veila effectively addresses key challenges in RGB-guided LiDAR generation, offering scalable and high-fidelity data augmentation for autonomous driving and robotics.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: Current diffusion-based LiDAR generation models lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their utility for scenario simulation and safety validation.

Method: The proposed framework uses semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation.

Result: La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, supported by new datasets (Waymo-SG, nuScenes-SG) and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: La La LiDAR sets a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation, offering customizable control while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative world models for autonomous driving overlook LiDAR properties, lacking controllability, temporal coherence, and standardized evaluation.

Method: LiDARCrafter parses natural language into ego-centric scene graphs, using a tri-branch diffusion network for object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry, with an autoregressive module for temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show LiDARCrafter excels in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency, supported by a new benchmark.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter advances LiDAR generation for data augmentation and simulation, with released code and benchmark.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long videos due to temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. The paper identifies key factors causing these issues.

Method: Proposes LongVie, featuring unified noise initialization, global control normalization, multi-modal control, and degradation-aware training. Introduces LongVGenBench for evaluation.

Result: LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllability, consistency, and quality for long videos.

Conclusion: LongVie effectively addresses challenges in ultra-long video generation, demonstrating superior performance through novel designs and a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

TL;DR: Trokens improves few-shot action recognition by transforming trajectory points into semantic-aware tokens, combining motion and appearance features for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in selecting informative tracking points and modeling their motion patterns for few-shot action recognition.

Method: Uses semantic-aware sampling for point selection and models motion with Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships.

Result: Achieves top performance on six benchmarks: Something-Something-V2, Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Conclusion: Trokens effectively integrates motion and appearance features, advancing few-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: READ is a real-time diffusion-transformer framework for talking head generation, using compressed latent spaces and an asynchronous noise scheduler to improve speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for talking head generation are slow, limiting practical use. READ aims to achieve real-time performance without sacrificing quality.

Method: READ uses a temporal VAE for spatiotemporal compression, a SpeechAE for audio-visual alignment, and an A2V-DiT backbone for synthesis. An asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) ensures temporal consistency and faster inference.

Result: READ generates high-quality talking head videos faster than state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robust performance in long-time generation.

Conclusion: READ successfully balances quality and speed in talking head generation, making it practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
