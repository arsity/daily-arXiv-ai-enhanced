Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to improve radiography report generation accuracy without requiring reward models or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RRG methods lack sufficient quality for real-world clinical deployment, while large VLMs show promise through LLM-inspired training strategies like alignment techniques.

Method: Introduces Random DPO framework that uses random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating need for reward models or human preference annotations.

Result: Experiments show up to 5% improvement in clinical performance metrics when supplementing three state-of-the-art models with Random DPO, without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: The proposed Random DPO framework effectively enhances RRG accuracy in a model-agnostic manner, demonstrating practical potential for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal approach for autism detection using video data, introducing novel gaze descriptors that improve classification accuracy and address limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided autism diagnostic methods struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack real-world generalizability, creating a need for more robust multimodal approaches.

Method: Analyzed a large, balanced dataset of 325 participants using multimodal features (facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, HRV, gaze behavior) and introduced novel statistical descriptors for gaze variability. Used late fusion for classification.

Result: Improved gaze-based classification from 64% to 69% using novel gaze descriptors. Achieved overall classification accuracy of 74% through multimodal fusion, demonstrating better performance than single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of scalable video-based screening tools for autism assessment by effectively integrating multiple behavioral markers across different modalities.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA is a memory compression framework that reduces KV cache memory usage by 36% and speeds up inference by 1.21x through selective context retention and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic attention cost and unbounded KV memory growth in Vision-Language-Action models during long-horizon inference, which limits real-time deployment scalability.

Method: Partitions KV cache into fixed-size chunks and uses a recurrent gating module to selectively retain high-utility context while pruning stale memory, maintaining causality.

Result: Achieves up to 36% KV memory reduction and 1.21x inference speedup with minimal impact on task success rates.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable inference for VLA models without requiring modifications to training pipelines or downstream control logic.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A phrase-grounded fact-checking model that detects errors in automatically generated chest radiology reports by verifying findings and their locations using a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network trained on synthetic error data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision language models can generate realistic radiology reports but suffer from factual errors and hallucinations, which hinders their clinical adoption. There's a need to detect and verify the accuracy of generated findings and their anatomical locations.

Method: Created a large synthetic dataset by perturbing findings and locations in ground truth reports to form real/fake pairs. Trained a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network on this dataset to verify finding veracity and localization.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in finding veracity prediction and localization across multiple X-ray datasets. Showed strong performance in detecting errors in state-of-the-art report generators with 0.997 concordance correlation coefficient compared to ground truth verification.

Conclusion: The proposed fact-checking model is effective for clinical inference in radiology workflows, providing reliable error detection in automatically generated reports to improve their clinical utility and safety.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal deep learning architecture (MDF-MLLM) that integrates fine-grained retinal image features with global textual context significantly improves disease classification accuracy from fundus images, achieving 94% accuracy compared to 60% for baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM, using patch-wise projection, scaled cross-attention, and FiLM-based U-Net modulation for vision-text fusion.

Result: MDF-MLLM achieved 94% accuracy on dual-type disease classification, representing a 56% improvement over baseline MLLM (60% accuracy). Recall and F1-scores improved by up to 67% and 35% respectively, with particular gains for inherited diseases with rich clinical text.

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM provides a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification that outperforms traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion, showing promise for clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MPDA, a multimodal jailbreak attack that uses image modality to separate harmful semantic components from unsafe prompts, enabling bypassing of safety filters in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate text prompts and struggle to bypass safety filters, leaving vulnerabilities in image-based inputs unexplored.

Method: MPDA uses LLM to decouple unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful prompts, rewrites harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts, and uses visual language model for iterative refinement to ensure semantic consistency.

Result: The method successfully bypasses safety filters in T2I models to generate NSFW content while maintaining semantic consistency with original unsafe prompts.

Conclusion: MPDA demonstrates the vulnerability of T2I models to multimodal jailbreak attacks and highlights the need for more robust safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach for salient object detection that combines supervision from salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection to address incomplete predictions and inaccurate boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for salient object detection suffer from incomplete predictions due to object complexity and inaccurate boundaries caused by convolution/pooling operations.

Method: Proposes training saliency detection networks using intertwined supervision from salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection tasks, with a novel mutual learning module (MLM) consisting of multiple network branches trained in mutual learning manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

Conclusion: The multi-task learning approach with mutual learning modules effectively improves saliency map quality by addressing incomplete predictions and boundary inaccuracies, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore is a new evaluation metric for multimodal relevance that handles N modalities (N≥3) using multimodal joint representation, overcoming limitations of existing bimodal metrics like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal relevance metrics are limited to bimodal analysis (e.g., CLIP), which restricts evaluation of similarity across multiple modalities (3+ modalities).

Method: Uses multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space, enabling fair relevance scoring across different modalities at one scale.

Result: Extensive experiments show MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistent modality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAJORScore serves as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based automated scaffolding inspection system using point cloud data to detect structural modifications and improve safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual inspections are time-consuming and prone to human errors, potentially leading to unsafe conditions on construction sites.

Method: Developed a cloud-based AI platform that processes point cloud data and compares it with certified reference data to detect structural modifications.

Result: The system enables automated monitoring of scaffolding structures, reducing manual inspection time and effort.

Conclusion: AI and digitization can enhance scaffolding inspection accuracy and contribute to improved construction site safety.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

### [10] [Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21375)
*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic prompt engineering framework for counterfactual size control in text-to-image generation, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation, particularly for generating images that contradict common-sense patterns like size relationships.

Method: Three-component framework: image evaluator for dataset construction, supervised prompt rewriter for revised prompts, and DPO-trained ranker for optimal prompt selection. Built first counterfactual size text-image dataset.

Result: Enhanced image evaluator achieved 114% improvement over backbone. Method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

### [11] [In silico Deep Learning Protocols for Label-Free Super-Resolution Microscopy: A Comparative Study of Network Architectures and SNR Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21376)
*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two deep neural network architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) for super-resolution optical microscopy using non-fluorescent phase-contrast techniques, showing they are complementary approaches that perform best under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resolution limitations of conventional optical microscopy (~200nm) without requiring expensive specialized equipment or fluorescent techniques, making super-resolution microscopy more accessible to non-specialist users.

Method: Used two previously developed DNN architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) to super-resolve images from non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopes (Zernike PCM and DIC), tested on custom nanoscale test targets calibrated with AFM.

Result: Both O-Net and Theta-Net performed well but were complementary - O-Net worked better with high SNR images, while Theta-Net was preferred for low SNR conditions, even when using the same training data and epochs.

Conclusion: The choice of DNN architecture significantly impacts super-resolution performance in non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, with optimal performance depending on image SNR conditions, demonstrating the importance of matching model architecture to specific imaging conditions.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTF-AVN is a novel audio-visual navigation method that uses multi-target architecture and Transformer-based fusion to dynamically integrate visual and audio cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works on audiovisual embodied navigation often overlook deeper perceptual context and fail to effectively leverage multimodal cues for navigation guidance.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN) using multi-target architecture with refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA).

Conclusion: The model exhibits strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia introduces supervised sparse autoencoder training for text-to-image diffusion models that creates one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, enabling more efficient concept unlearning with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept unlearning methods require extensive search procedures because concept representations are distributed across multiple latent features, making precise localization difficult.

Method: Supervised sparse autoencoder training with systematic concept labeling that promotes feature centralization and mitigates feature splitting, creating specialized neurons with strong concept associations.

Result: Reduces hyperparameter search by 96.67%, achieves 9.22% improvement on UnlearnCanvas benchmark, and shows 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal in sequential tasks.

Conclusion: SAEmnesia provides an interpretable representation that significantly improves concept unlearning efficiency and scalability while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

### [14] [Coreset selection based on Intra-class diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21380)
*Imran Ashraf,Mukhtar Ullah,Muhammad Faisal Nadeem,Muhammad Nouman Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an intelligent coreset selection method for biomedical image classification that extracts intra-class diversity through clustering to create representative subsets, outperforming random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for biomedical image classification require substantial computational resources for training and hyperparameter tuning, especially with large datasets. Random sampling for coreset selection fails to capture intra-class diversity and is biased towards dominant classes.

Method: Introduces a lightweight mechanism that extracts intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters, which are then utilized for final sampling to create representative coresets.

Result: Extensive experiments on biomedical imaging datasets show the proposed scheme outperforms random sampling on several performance metrics under uniform conditions.

Conclusion: The intelligent coreset selection method effectively addresses the limitations of random sampling by capturing intra-class diversity, providing a more representative subset for efficient deep learning training and hyperparameter search.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the

*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam is a deep learning model that uses current and up to four prior mammograms to improve breast cancer prediction by capturing spatial and temporal patterns, outperforming single-visit models in real-world screening settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for breast cancer screening use limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings with imbalanced outcomes and heterogeneous follow-up, requiring more robust longitudinal approaches.

Method: Developed LongiMam - an end-to-end deep learning model combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to integrate current and up to four prior mammograms, capturing both spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast cancer.

Result: LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included, with current+prior visits outperforming single-visit models. Model performed best in women with observed mammographic density changes over time and was effective across key risk groups including dense breasts and older women.

Conclusion: Longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and supports using repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is available as open-source software.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNNs show limited correspondence with human social cognition processes like image valence appraisal, struggling to reflect higher-order brain processing beyond basic visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether CNN-brain correspondences extend beyond general visual perception to more complex social cognition processes like image valence appraisal.

Method: Correlation analysis between CNN architectures and human behavioral/fMRI data, plus Object2Brain framework combining GradCAM and object detection at filter level.

Result: CNNs struggle to go beyond simple visual processing and don't reflect higher-order brain processing for social cognition tasks. Different architectures show varying object class sensitivities despite similar correlation trends.

Conclusion: CNN-brain correspondences are limited for complex social cognition tasks, suggesting CNNs may not adequately model higher-order human brain processing in social contexts.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug is an interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models that removes undesired concepts and retrains models using concept-level feedback converted to sample-level labels for bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interventions in CBMs fail to address systemic misalignment between the model and expert reasoning, particularly when models learn shortcuts from biased data.

Method: Two-step process: Removal (experts identify and remove undesired concepts) and Retraining (CBDebug converts concept-level feedback to sample-level auxiliary labels for supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation).

Result: CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces model reliance on undesired concepts by leveraging CBM interpretability to translate expert feedback into actionable training signals.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder is an open-source QGIS plugin that uses deep learning to automatically detect shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data, outperforming existing tools like ArcGIS toolkit and traditional sinkhole detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of bathymetric data for shipwreck detection is time-consuming and requires expert analysis. There's a need for automated tools to streamline this process for maritime archaeology and historical research.

Method: Developed a deep learning model trained on shipwreck data from Great Lakes and Irish coasts, enhanced with synthetic data generation. The tool automatically preprocesses bathymetry data, performs inference, thresholds outputs, and produces segmentation masks or bounding boxes.

Result: Demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and classical inverse sinkhole detection methods. The tool successfully automates shipwreck detection from multibeam sonar data.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder provides an effective open-source solution for automated shipwreck detection, making maritime archaeology more accessible and efficient through deep learning and synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

### [19] [Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21387)
*Sanish Suwal,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how magnitude-based pruning affects neural network interpretability, finding that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency map focus and faithfulness while maintaining meaningful concepts, but aggressive pruning reduces interpretability despite preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of neural network pruning on model interpretability, as prior works focused on performance preservation but neglected interpretability effects.

Method: Used ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, applied magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning, compared Vanilla Gradients and Integrated Gradients explanations across pruning levels, and used CRAFT-based concept extraction to analyze semantic coherence.

Result: Light-to-moderate pruning improved saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, meaningful concepts. Aggressive pruning merged heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Pruning can shape representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, but excessive pruning undermines interpretability despite maintaining performance.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D is the first method for joint layout estimation and 3D object detection from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on point cloud input, which limits applicability since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data is more common. There's a need for methods that work with multi-view images without requiring ground-truth poses or depth supervision.

Method: Builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone with two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation using a novel parametric wall representation. Works with multi-view images without ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: using ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images. Performs on par with specialized 3D object detection methods while significantly advancing layout estimation.

Conclusion: TUN3D sets a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding by enabling joint layout estimation and 3D object detection from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

*Qiyu Ma,Wanli Ni,Zhijin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative semantic communication system that segments images into key and non-key regions, using different encoding strategies for each to improve transmission efficiency while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods treat all image regions equally, neglecting the varying importance of different visual content, which can compromise reconstruction quality of critical areas.

Method: Segments images into key and non-key regions; key regions use image-oriented semantic encoder, non-key regions use image-to-text compression; employs model quantization and low-rank adaptation for lightweight deployment.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in both semantic fidelity and visual quality, demonstrating effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully addresses the limitation of equal treatment for all image regions and achieves superior performance while being computationally efficient through lightweight deployment strategies.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

### [23] [Skeleton Sparsification and Densification Scale-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21398)
*Julia Gierke,Pascal Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces skeletonisation scale-spaces, a framework that combines medial axis sparsification with scale-space theory to achieve hierarchical shape simplification while maintaining key scale-space properties like hierarchical architecture and geometric equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The medial axis (Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton) is sensitive to noise, where minor boundary variations cause disproportionate skeletal expansions. Classical pruning methods address this but lack formal scale-space properties.

Method: Proposes skeletonisation scale-spaces that leverage sparsification of the medial axis for hierarchical shape simplification. The framework includes both continuous and discrete formulations, and extends to densification for inverse progression from coarse to fine scales.

Result: The framework satisfies key scale-space properties (hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, geometric equivariance) and enables robust skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: Skeletonisation scale-spaces provide a theoretically grounded approach for hierarchical shape simplification that overcomes medial axis sensitivity to noise, with practical applications in robust skeletonisation, compression, and manufacturing.

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: Using super-resolution models to downscale climate projections from 12.5 km to 1 km resolution, trained on observational data and evaluated with climate indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution climate projections are needed for local decision-making, but current projections have low spatial resolution (12.5 km), limiting their usability.

Method: Train single-image super-resolution models on high-resolution observational gridded data, then apply them to low-resolution climate projections. Use climate indicator-based assessment with observed climate indices from weather stations for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on daily mean temperature show that super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution projections.

Conclusion: Single-image super-resolution models are effective for statistically downscaling climate projections to higher resolution when trained on observational data.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JaiLIP is a jailbreaking attack method that uses loss-guided image perturbations to make Vision-Language Models generate harmful outputs while maintaining imperceptible modifications to images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to image-based jailbreak attacks that can bypass safety alignments, and existing methods have unstable performance and visible perturbations.

Method: Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP) minimizes a joint objective combining MSE loss between clean/adversarial images and the model's harmful-output loss.

Result: JaiLIP generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images that outperform existing methods in producing toxicity, and works in practical domains like transportation.

Conclusion: Image-based jailbreak attacks pose practical challenges for VLMs, highlighting the need for efficient defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the gap between automated species identification systems and human expertise, and compare their uncertainty levels since even experts can be confused or disagree on species identification from visual observations.

Method: Evaluated 19 deep-learning systems from 4 research teams against 9 expert botanists specializing in French flora through the ExpertCLEF challenge framework.

Result: State-of-the-art deep learning models achieved performance close to the most advanced human expertise in plant identification.

Conclusion: Automated plant identification using deep learning has reached near-human expert levels, providing valuable insights for both computer scientists and naturalists about the current capabilities and limitations of AI systems in biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: QuadGPT is the first autoregressive framework for end-to-end quadrilateral mesh generation, using unified tokenization for mixed topologies and RL fine-tuning to surpass triangle-to-quad conversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate quad meshes by first creating triangle meshes and then merging them, which produces poor topology. There's a need for native quad-mesh generation.

Method: Autoregressive framework with unified tokenization for mixed triangle/quad topologies and specialized RL fine-tuning (tDPO) for better generation quality.

Result: Significantly surpasses previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality.

Conclusion: Establishes new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and demonstrates power of combining autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

### [28] [DyME: Dynamic Multi-Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Bi-Level Orthogonal LoRA Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21433)
*Jiaqi Liu,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME is a dynamic multi-concept erasure framework for diffusion models that uses lightweight LoRA adapters with orthogonality constraints to selectively remove copyrighted content on-demand, outperforming static erasure methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods don't scale to practical multi-concept scenarios and use static fine-tuning that degrades performance when handling varying erasure needs at inference time.

Method: Trains concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes them at inference with bi-level orthogonality constraints at feature and parameter levels to prevent interference between adapters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Conclusion: DyME's modular adapter composition with orthogonality constraints enables effective on-demand multi-concept erasure in diffusion models, addressing scalability and interference issues in practical settings.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge is a specialized MLLM for evaluating video understanding models, outperforming larger baselines and showing that video inputs are crucial for accurate evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture human judgment nuances for video understanding, and manual evaluation is costly. LLM/MLLM evaluators for video tasks remain underexplored.

Method: Train VideoJudge (3B/7B MLLM) using generator-evaluator interplay: generator produces responses conditioned on target ratings, and mismatched responses are discarded.

Result: VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM baselines (Qwen2.5-VL 32B/72B) on 3 out of 4 benchmarks. LLM judges perform worse than MLLM judges, and chain-of-thought reasoning doesn't help.

Conclusion: Video inputs are essential for evaluating video understanding tasks, and specialized MLLM judges like VideoJudge can effectively assess video model outputs.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

### [30] [Residual Vector Quantization For Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464)
*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom is a learned feature codec for multi-agent collaborative perception that achieves 273x to 1365x compression (6-30 bpp) while preserving spatial identity and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bandwidth constraints limit scalability in multi-agent collaborative perception systems where agents need to share information for better scene understanding.

Method: End-to-end method using a bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ) to compress feature dimensions, transmitting only per-pixel code indices.

Result: Achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp on DAIR-V2X dataset, matches or outperforms raw-feature CP at 18 bpp (455x), and enables ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation.

Conclusion: ReVQom enables efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception, making practical V2X deployment feasible through significant bandwidth reduction.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

### [31] [Gender Stereotypes in Professional Roles Among Saudis: An Analytical Study of AI-Generated Images Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21466)
*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-Image AI models (ImageFX, DALL-E V3, Grok) show strong gender bias and cultural inaccuracies when generating Saudi professionals, with DALL-E V3 being 96% male in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how contemporary AI models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in depicting Saudi professionals.

Method: Analyzed 1,006 images from three AI models using neutral prompts for 56 Saudi professions, with two trained Saudi annotators evaluating each image on five dimensions (gender, clothing, background, activities, age), plus adjudication by senior researcher.

Result: Strong gender imbalance: ImageFX 85% male, Grok 86.6% male, DALL-E V3 96% male. DALL-E V3 showed strongest gender stereotyping, especially in leadership/technical roles. Cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and activities were common across all models.

Conclusion: Current AI models mirror societal biases from training data, offering limited reflection of Saudi labor market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances. Need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model pretraining approach for unified inappropriate content detection in short videos, addressing distribution gaps and complex issue definitions through three targeted tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches train separate small models for each content issue type, requiring extensive human-labeled data and lacking cross-issue generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes three pretraining tasks: Caption (enhancing video detail perception), Visual Question Answering (deepening understanding of issue definitions), and Chain-of-Thought (enhancing reasoning capability).

Result: Significantly improves MLLM performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings, with strong generalization to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Conclusion: The reasoning-enhanced MLLM pretraining paradigm effectively addresses distribution gaps and complex issue definitions for unified inappropriate content detection in short videos.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: GUI-Cursor reframes GUI grounding as an interactive search task using cursor movement instead of direct coordinate prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results through multi-step reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coordinate prediction approaches in GUI grounding often fail with high-resolution images and complex layouts, as VLMs struggle with accurate numeric coordinate prediction.

Method: Frames GUI grounding as interactive search where VLM generates cursor movements step-by-step, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with dense trajectory-based rewards.

Result: GUI-Cursor improves GUI grounding accuracy significantly: ScreenSpot-v2 (88.8% → 93.9%) and ScreenSpot-Pro (26.8% → 56.5%), solving 95% of instances within two steps.

Conclusion: Interactive search paradigm with cursor movement is more effective than direct coordinate prediction for GUI grounding, enabling adaptive step usage and better spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

*Prasanna Reddy Pulakurthi,Jiamian Wang,Majid Rabbani,Sohail Dianat,Raghuveer Rao,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-CoT is an explainable text-to-video retrieval framework that replaces embedding-based similarity ranking with LLM chain-of-thought reasoning, providing detailed rationales for ranking decisions while improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video retrieval systems have two key limitations: they are vulnerable to low-quality text-video data pairs that are hard to identify, and cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for ranking results, limiting interpretability.

Method: Proposes X-CoT framework that uses LLM chain-of-thought reasoning instead of embedding models. Expands benchmarks with additional video annotations, and devises a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps that yield detailed reasoning and complete ranking.

Result: X-CoT empirically improves retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses interpretability issues in text-to-video retrieval while enhancing performance, enabling better assessment of retrieval models and examination of text-video data quality.

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for reliable visual defect detection in surgical instruments that adapts unsupervised approaches with background masking, patch-based analysis, and domain adaptation to overcome transfer learning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of surgical instruments is error-prone, and existing automated defect detection methods trained on natural/industrial images fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain due to domain shift, false positives from textured backgrounds, and poor sensitivity to small defects.

Method: Proposes a versatile method that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical instruments by integrating background masking, patch-based analysis strategy, and efficient domain adaptation.

Result: The method overcomes limitations of existing approaches and enables reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses domain shift challenges and provides effective defect detection for surgical instruments, overcoming issues with false positives and poor sensitivity to small defects.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

*Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSEP (Linear SEParability) regularization as an alternative to representation alignment methods for training diffusion models, eliminating the need for expensive external encoders while improving training efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment-based approaches for improving diffusion model representations depend on computationally expensive pretrained encoders, creating a need for more efficient training strategies that don't rely on external components.

Method: The authors introduce LSEP regularization that promotes linear separability of intermediate layer representations, incorporating linear probing directly into the learning dynamics rather than using it only for post-hoc evaluation.

Result: The method achieves substantial improvements in training efficiency and generation quality, with an FID of 1.46 on 256×256 ImageNet dataset using flow-based transformer architectures like SiTs.

Conclusion: LSEP provides an effective alternative to alignment-based methods by eliminating dependency on external encoders while maintaining or improving representation quality and generation performance.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

*Boyi Chen,Zhangyu Wang,Fabian Deuser,Johann Maximilian Zollner,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatially regularized contrastive learning method that uses semivariograms to model spatial dependencies improves image-based geo-localization by addressing false negatives and hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods for geo-localization neglect spatial dependencies, leading to issues with false negatives (visually/geographically similar images labeled as negatives) and hard negatives (visually similar but geographically distant images).

Method: Proposed a spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates semivariograms - a geostatistical tool that models how spatial correlation changes with distance. The semivariogram relates feature space distance to geographical distance to capture expected visual content in spatial correlation.

Result: Evaluation on OSV5M dataset shows that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial dependencies through semivariograms in contrastive learning significantly enhances geo-localization accuracy by better handling false negatives and hard negatives.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create digital human agents that can engage in persistent, intelligent audiovisual interactions from a single portrait, enabling real-time open-ended video calls with streaming multimodal inputs.

Method: Uses a Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture: Thinker module (pretrained large language-speech model) perceives and reasons over inputs, while Actor module (chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model) generates synchronized multimodal responses. Features inter/intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned multimodal positional embeddings, chunk-wise diffusion forcing, and global identity referencing.

Result: X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs, sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits with fine-grained cross-modality alignment and context retention.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables unified world modeling of interactive digital humans, paving the way for persistent and intelligent audiovisual interactions across multiple modalities in real-time settings.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for forecasting motion from single images by generating dense trajectory grids instead of pixels, achieving better accuracy and diversity than prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict how objects move from a single image without observing velocities or forces, addressing limitations of video generators that struggle with motion forecasting due to pixel generation overhead.

Method: Formulates motion forecasting as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids using an architecture similar to modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels.

Result: The approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior methods, and shows effectiveness on robotics applications and real-world physics datasets.

Conclusion: Directly modeling motion through trajectory grids outperforms pixel-based video generators for motion forecasting tasks, especially in simple physical scenarios where video generators struggle despite fine-tuning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of DINOv3 (spatial processing) vs V-JEPA2 (temporal modeling) for video action recognition, revealing trade-offs: DINOv3 excels at pose recognition with better clustering but V-JEPA2 provides more consistent performance across action types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand architectural trade-offs between spatial-only and temporal modeling approaches in self-supervised learning for video action recognition.

Method: Evaluated both architectures on UCF Sports dataset using multiple metrics: classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination.

Result: DINOv3 achieved superior clustering (Silhouette: 0.31 vs 0.21) and discrimination (6.16x separation ratio) for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 showed lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288) and consistent reliability across all action types.

Conclusion: DINOv3 excels at static pose recognition but degrades on motion-dependent actions, while V-JEPA2 provides balanced representation quality. Findings guide architectural selection based on task requirements and reliability constraints.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCE is a multimodal system that generates comprehensive disaster damage descriptions from satellite and UAV imagery, outperforming baseline models in informativeness while maintaining semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage assessment methods are slow and dangerous after natural disasters. Current computer vision approaches only provide classification labels or segmentation masks, lacking comprehensive situational understanding.

Method: Uses dual-architecture: CNN-LSTM with ResNet50 backbone for satellite imagery (xBD dataset) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for UAV pictures (RescueNet dataset). Incorporates external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to enhance vocabulary and description accuracy.

Result: VLCE significantly outperforms baseline models (LLaVA and QwenVL), achieving up to 95.33% on InfoMetIC for caption informativeness while maintaining competitive semantic alignment as measured by CLIPScore.

Conclusion: The dual-architecture system shows significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone imagery.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

TL;DR: The paper develops a principled framework using representational similarity metrics to analyze and classify large vision models, revealing that model families have distinct geometric and tuning signatures while linearly decodable information is more universal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which aspects of vision model representations are shared across different architectures and training paradigms, and which reflect distinctive computational strategies, given the wide diversity in current vision models.

Method: Uses multiple representational similarity metrics (RSA, Soft Matching, Linear Predictivity) capturing different facets of representations, and integrates them using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) - a method inspired by multi-omics integration in biology.

Result: Geometry and tuning metrics strongly discriminate model families, while linear decodability shows weaker separation. SNF integration achieves substantially sharper family separation than individual metrics. Clustering reveals supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, self-supervised models group across architectures, and hybrid architectures cluster with masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled typology showing that emergent computational strategies, shaped jointly by architecture and training objective, define representational structure beyond surface design categories, with convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training.

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Motivation: Current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, limiting their spatial consistency and utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks like AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation.

Method: Augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch for joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D fields, using cross-branch supervision where geometry guides video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction.

Result: Outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency, with geometric branch latents serving as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception through unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange, enabling consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations.

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

*Mahindra Singh Rautela,Alexander Most,Siddharth Mansingh,Bradley C. Love,Ayan Biswas,Diane Oyen,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH is a shape-agnostic autoregressive foundation model for PDEs that handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets across 1D-3D dimensions, multiple fields, and mixed scalar/vector components, achieving strong performance through pretraining and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible foundation model that can handle the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations in PDEs, addressing challenges of varying data dimensionality, resolutions, and mixed field types.

Method: Built on convolutional vision transformer with component-wise convolution for local interactions, inter-field cross-attention for field information propagation, and axial attentions for computational efficiency. Pretrained on diverse PDE datasets and evaluated with full fine-tuning and LoRA adapters.

Result: Outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization, matches or surpasses strong baselines and state-of-the-art models across extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MORPH presents a powerful backbone for scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning, charting a path toward handling the complex nature of scientific observations.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-YOLO combines MobileNetV4 backbone with SlideLoss to improve infrared object detection efficiency and handle class imbalance, achieving competitive performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in infrared object detection including class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints for real-time urban applications.

Method: Replace YOLOv8's CSPDarknet with MobileNetV4 backbone and introduce SlideLoss function to dynamically emphasize under-represented and occluded samples.

Result: Achieves competitive mAP and superior precision with only 6.7 GFLOPs, reducing computational overhead by 1.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: MS-YOLO effectively balances detection quality and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR introduces motion-aware Transformer for multi-object tracking by explicitly predicting object movements to update track queries, reducing query conflicts and improving both detection and association performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based MOT frameworks process detection and tracking queries jointly in a single Transformer layer, causing conflicts and degraded association accuracy.

Method: Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance, reducing query collisions and enabling more consistent training.

Result: MATR achieves state-of-the-art performance: 71.3 HOTA on DanceTrack (9+ point improvement), 72.2 HOTA on SportsMOT, and 54.7 mTETA/41.6 mHOTA on BDD100k without external data.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers provides a simple yet highly effective approach for advancing multi-object tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

### [47] [DeLiVR: Differential Spatiotemporal Lie Bias for Efficient Video Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21719)
*Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Xiang Chen,Jichao Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR is an efficient video deraining method that uses Lie-group differential biases in attention scores to enforce spatiotemporal consistency, outperforming existing methods that rely on optical flow or heuristic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos in the wild suffer from rain streaks, blur, noise, and temporal artifacts from camera pose changes. Existing methods using optical flow or heuristic alignment are computationally expensive and less robust.

Method: Proposes DeLiVR with two components: 1) rotation-bounded Lie relative bias that predicts in-plane angles for geometry-consistent alignment, and 2) differential group displacement that computes angular differences between frames to estimate velocity with temporal decay and attention masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on publicly available benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Lie groups provide a principled way to represent geometric transformations for enforcing spatiotemporal consistency in video deraining, leading to an efficient and effective solution.

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

### [48] [On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722)
*Nathan Inkawhich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates foundational AI models for SAR object recognition, showing that while current visual models perform poorly on SAR data off-the-shelf, self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data creates state-of-the-art foundation models that significantly outperform existing SAR-domain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to apply the transformative progress in foundational AI/ML models from natural images to the SAR domain, leveraging benefits like limited labeled data requirements, robustness to distribution shift, and transferable features.

Method: The method involves testing current visual foundational models (DINOv2, DINOv3, PE-Core) on SAR data, then performing self-supervised fine-tuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data to create AFRL-DINOv2 models.

Result: The results show that self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data creates state-of-the-art SAR foundation models that significantly outperform the current best SAR-domain model SARATR-X, with analysis of performance trade-offs across different backbones and adaptation recipes.

Conclusion: While the work demonstrates viability of foundational models for SAR object recognition and sets new state-of-the-art performance, there is still significant room for improvement in SAR foundation model development.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim is an image-based UI simulator that predicts and synthesizes realistic mobile UI transitions from screen images, enabling scalable testing and AI agent training without physical devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UI testing methods rely on physical devices or static screenshot analysis, which limits scalability and hinders development of intelligent UI agents that need dynamic interaction capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Predict abstract layout of next UI state given initial screen and user action, 2) Synthesize visually consistent new image based on predicted layout to simulate realistic UI transitions.

Result: UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, demonstrating high fidelity in UI transition simulation.

Conclusion: UISim provides practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation, while enabling advanced applications like UI navigation task planning for AI agents.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Conclusion: LFA-Net provides an efficient and lightweight solution for retinal vessel segmentation that is ideal for resource-constrained clinical environments while maintaining high segmentation performance.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational

network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million

*Qing Zhu,Wangdong Guo,Qirong Mao,Xiaohua Huang,Xiuyan Shao,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for group-level emotion recognition that incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information through multi-scale scene encoding and LLM-generated emotion lexicons, achieving competitive performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling individual relationships and overlook the crucial role of semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of emotions.

Method: Proposes a framework with visual context encoding module using multi-scale scene information, emotion semantic encoding module using LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined through structured emotion tree, and similarity-aware interaction to align visual and semantic information.

Result: Experiments on three widely adopted GER datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively incorporates both visual scene context and semantic information to improve group-level emotion recognition performance.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of Segment Anything Model (SAM) to medical imaging faces challenges including ambiguous boundaries, lack of anatomical relationship modeling, and absence of uncertainty quantification, which are critical for clinical applications.

Method: KG-SAM integrates: (i) medical knowledge graph for anatomical relationships, (ii) energy-based Conditional Random Field for anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) uncertainty-aware fusion module for reliability in clinical scenarios.

Result: Achieved average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate segmentation, and substantial gains in abdominal segmentation with 78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT across multi-center medical datasets.

Conclusion: KG-SAM establishes itself as a robust and generalizable framework that significantly advances medical image segmentation by addressing key limitations of SAM through knowledge-guided integration.

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and

### [53] [UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760)
*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid is a framework that fine-tunes a pre-trained video diffusion transformer to handle diverse vision tasks without task-specific modifications, using visual sentences to represent tasks and enable cross-modal and cross-source generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more unified and scalable alternative to task-specific pre-training across modalities, leveraging pre-trained video generation models that already capture temporal sequence dependencies.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks by representing tasks as visual sentences, where context sequences define both the task and expected output modality.

Result: UniVid generalizes well in cross-modal inference (images and videos) and cross-source tasks (natural to annotated data) despite being trained only on natural video data. Understanding and generation tasks can switch by reversing visual sentence order.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models have potential to serve as scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling, enabling generalization across modalities and sources without multi-source pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token merging method that maintains spatial integrity for compatibility with modern ViT architectures using window attention and spatial designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods fail to preserve spatial structure required by modern ViT architectures with window attention, decomposed positional embeddings, and RoPE.

Method: Uses 2D reduction strategy for structured layouts, spatial-aware merging to maintain relative positions, and max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation to preserve salient features.

Result: Achieves 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop on COCO, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no accuracy drop on ImageNet after one fine-tuning epoch.

Conclusion: The method enables effective token reduction while maintaining spatial structure compatibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GASP-ICL is a training-free framework that enhances multimodal deepfake detection in LVLMs by using adaptive retrieval and propagation mechanisms to select semantically aligned demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with detecting subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval in multimodal deepfake detection.

Method: Proposes GASP-ICL framework with MDD-adapted feature extractor for aligned image-text retrieval and Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) for cross-sample relation capture and query-aligned signal propagation.

Result: Experiments on four forgery types show GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines and delivers performance gains without requiring LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GASP-ICL effectively enhances multimodal deepfake detection capabilities in LVLMs through training-free in-context learning with semantic alignment and adaptive scoring.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ProDA is a novel framework for action recognition that disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes using spatio-temporal scene graphs and dynamic prompts to generate action-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract unified features for all actions in a video, which struggles to model interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. The paper aims to address this by disentangling specific actions from complex scenes.

Method: ProDA uses Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces a Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. It features a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Result: Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of ProDA when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ProDA framework successfully disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes and shows improved performance in action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we

Result: Created a multimodal dataset for hate identification and developed DeHater model that sets new standards in AI-driven image hate detection.

Conclusion: The approach contributes to more ethical AI applications in social media by effectively detecting and removing hateful content from digital images.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual
prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in
social media.

Conclusion: MIRG-RL effectively addresses cross-image reasoning challenges through its unified framework and training approach, demonstrating significant improvements in multi-image understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongScape is a hybrid video generation framework that combines diffusion denoising with autoregressive generation using action-guided chunking and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts to achieve stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with stable long-horizon generation - diffusion-based approaches suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift, while autoregressive methods compromise visual detail, limiting their effectiveness for generating high-quality embodied manipulation data.

Method: Hybrid framework combining intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation. Uses action-guided variable-length chunking based on robotic action semantics, and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts, achieving both temporal consistency and high visual quality.

Conclusion: LongScape successfully addresses the limitations of existing video generation methods by adaptively combining diffusion and autoregressive approaches with semantic chunking, enabling stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoWM is a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses motion-aware latent representations with fine-grained pixel features for embodied action planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing world models - pixel-level models have visual redundancies that hinder action decoding, while latent models overlook fine-grained details needed for precise manipulation.

Method: Fuses representations from hybrid world models: uses motion-aware latent representations as high-level prior to guide extraction of fine-grained visual features from pixel space model, highlighting informative visual details for action decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization on CALVIN benchmark, with comprehensive analysis of feature space strengths.

Conclusion: MoWM effectively combines the strengths of different world model representations for embodied action planning, providing valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTraj is a training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT), featuring foreground-background separation guidance and inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory control methods require substantial training resources or are designed for U-Net, not leveraging DiT's superior performance.

Method: Uses LLM to separate prompts into foreground/background, then applies STD-RoPE to modify foreground tokens' position embedding to eliminate cross-frame spatial discrepancies and strengthen attention.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Conclusion: DiTraj provides an effective training-free solution for trajectory control in DiT-based video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Motivation: Multi-hop reasoning requiring evidence combination across multiple passages remains challenging for transformer-based QA models, necessitating better retrieval strategies.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of retrieval strategies including cosine similarity, maximal marginal relevance, and hybrid method with dense embeddings, lexical overlap, and re-ranking. Adapted EfficientRAG pipeline with query optimization, token labeling, and iterative refinement.

Result: Hybrid approach achieved 50% relative improvement in exact match and 47% in F1 score compared to cosine similarity baseline on HotpotQA dataset. Improved entity recall and evidence complementarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop QA, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, though limitations remain in handling distractors and temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDR-4DGS enables high dynamic range novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes by jointly modeling temporal radiance variations and 3D translation between LDR and HDR domains using Gaussian Splatting with dynamic tone-mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HDR NVS methods focus on static scenes, but real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements like moving objects and varying lighting conditions, creating a more challenging problem that needs to address temporal radiance variations.

Method: HDR-4DGS uses Gaussian Splatting architecture with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by adapting tone-mapping functions according to evolving radiance distributions across time.

Result: Extensive experiments show HDR-4DGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity, achieving temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation for photorealistic HDR renderings.

Conclusion: The proposed HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis problem and HDR-4DGS solution successfully address the challenge of dynamic scenes in HDR imaging, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

*Minje Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRHand is a method that reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry and textured images from low-resolution inputs by combining implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require high-resolution multi-view images and fail on low-resolution inputs. Existing super-resolution methods work only for static objects, not articulated deformable hands.

Method: Proposes geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling coarse images. Jointly optimizes implicit image function and explicit 3D hand shapes to maintain multi-view and pose consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling and 3D hand reconstruction methods on InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, achieving fine-detailed reconstruction including wrinkles and nails.

Conclusion: SRHand successfully reconstructs detailed 3D hand avatars from low-resolution images by leveraging implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes, overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper argues that current fake image detection research focuses too much on generative algorithms while neglecting proper definition and data collection of "real" images, suggesting we need to rethink what constitutes a real image given modern smartphone photography techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current fake image detection research, which relies on outdated "real" image datasets while modern smartphone photography uses neural network-based image formation algorithms similar to fake image generators.

Method: This position paper analyzes current practices in fake detection research, highlighting the reliance on old low-resolution datasets like ImageNet and the evolution of smartphone photography technology that uses neural networks to compute images from multiple inputs.

Result: The analysis reveals that current fake detection methods are built on outdated concepts of "real" images, as modern photography itself uses algorithmic processing that blurs the line between real and generated content.

Conclusion: The paper calls for rethinking the concept of "real" images, developing clear technical definitions of real images, creating new benchmark datasets, and questioning whether fake image detection is a sound objective given the convergence of image formation technologies.

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aes-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that improves multimodal LLMs for image aesthetic assessment by generating interpretable rationales alongside accurate scores through chain-of-thought reasoning and joint optimization of absolute and relative scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs have potential for image aesthetic assessment but struggle due to scarce multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the subjective nature of aesthetic judgment, making it hard to generate accurate judgments with interpretable rationales.

Method: Proposes Aes-R1 framework with AesCoT pipeline for constructing high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data, then uses Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO) RL algorithm to jointly optimize absolute score regression and relative ranking order.

Result: Aes-R1 improves backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size, and shows robust generalization under limited supervision and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableDub is a visual dubbing framework that addresses two key limitations: speaker-specific lip habit modeling and occlusion robustness. It uses Stable-Diffusion with lip-habit modulation and occlusion-aware training, achieving superior performance without expensive priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual dubbing methods have two critical deficiencies: audio-only driving fails to capture speaker-specific lip habits, and conventional inpainting produces artifacts when handling obstructions like microphones or hands.

Method: Built on Stable-Diffusion backbone with lip-habit-modulated mechanism for phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific dynamics. Uses occlusion-aware training by exposing occlusion objects to inpainting process. Employs hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture for training efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance, occlusion robustness, audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency. Eliminates need for cost-intensive priors and shows superior training efficiency.

Conclusion: StableDub expands the applicability of visual dubbing methods by addressing key limitations in lip habit modeling and occlusion handling, making it more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interactive control over object motion within text-driven 3D scene generation, allowing users to define 3D trajectories for objects and seamlessly integrate them into generated 3D environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Enhanced text-to-3D background generation using 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images; 2) 3D copy-and-paste approach with physics-aware object position learning; 3) Temporal animation using part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model with multiview image pairs.

Result: The framework achieves harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within high-quality 3D backgrounds, demonstrating effectiveness through evaluations at each stage and final results.

Conclusion: Drag4D provides a unified architecture for interactive 3D scene generation with object motion control, successfully integrating user-defined trajectories into generated 3D environments while maintaining view consistency and mitigating motion artifacts.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony generates high-resolution videos synchronized with audio using motion-aware loss and audio sync guidance, outperforming existing methods in both synchronization and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video and image-to-video models lack precise timing control, while audio provides natural temporal cues for motion synchronization, but current audio-to-video models struggle with fine-grained synchronization.

Method: Builds on pre-trained video backbone with two key components: Motion-aware Loss that emphasizes learning at high-motion regions, and Audio Sync Guidance that uses an off-sync model to better exploit audio cues while maintaining visual quality.

Result: Generates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Outperforms existing methods on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: Syncphony effectively addresses the synchronization challenge in audio-to-video generation through motion-aware training and audio guidance, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

### [70] [LG-CD: Enhancing Language-Guided Change Detection through SAM2 Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21894)
*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD) that uses natural language prompts to improve remote sensing change detection by integrating visual and textual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning methods focus only on visual information and neglect rich semantic information from multimodal data like text, limiting change detection accuracy and robustness.

Method: Uses SAM2 visual foundation model for feature extraction, multi-layer adapters for fine-tuning, Text Fusion Attention Module for visual-text alignment, and Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder with cross-attention for final change masks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and provides new insights for generalized change detection using multimodal information.

Conclusion: LG-CD effectively leverages multimodal information to significantly improve change detection accuracy and robustness, offering a promising direction for generalized change detection.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

*Qihang Wang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing that combines precise spatial control from drag interactions with fine-grained texture manipulation from text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven methods lack precise spatial control while drag-driven approaches miss fine-grained texture guidance. The paper aims to integrate both paradigms to overcome their complementary limitations.

Method: Proposes two key innovations: Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag for enhanced latent-space layout control through 3D feature mapping, and Drag-Text Guided Denoising that dynamically balances drag and text conditions during denoising.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity joint editing and matches or surpasses specialized text-only or drag-only approaches. It supports flexible editing modes (text-only, drag-only, or combined) while maintaining strong performance in each setting.

Conclusion: Establishes a versatile and generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation that integrates the strengths of both text-driven and drag-driven editing paradigms.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sideload-CL-adaptation framework that uses contrastive learning on unannotated UAV data to improve vehicle detection in Nordic regions with snow coverage challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection from UAV images in Nordic regions faces visibility challenges and domain shifts from diverse snow coverage. Annotated data is expensive while unannotated data is cheaper to obtain.

Method: Train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive learning on unannotated data, then sideload it to a frozen YOLO11n backbone during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments compared various fusion methods and granularity.

Result: The proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model improves detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance vehicle detection performance in challenging Nordic environments with snow coverage.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

*Xianghao Kong,Hansheng Chen,Yuwei Guo,Lvmin Zhang,Gordon Wetzstein,Maneesh Agrawala,Anyi Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IF-V2V is an inversion-free video editing method that adapts flow-matching-based image-to-video models for video editing without requiring inversion or extensive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require inversion with model-specific design or extensive optimization, limiting their ability to leverage up-to-date image-to-video models for transferring image editing capabilities to video domain.

Method: Proposes Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate source video information into denoising process, Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization for motion-aware noise generation, and Deviation Caching to minimize computational cost.

Result: The method achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches while offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: IF-V2V provides an effective inversion-free approach for video editing that can adapt off-the-shelf I2V models without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

*Hong Mo,Xiong Zhang,Tengfei Shi,Zhongbo Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSLCounter is a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view counting that uses neural volumetric rendering to reduce dependency on large annotated datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 70% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multi-view counting methods rely on fully supervised learning which requires large amounts of annotated data, creating a bottleneck for practical applications.

Method: Uses neural volumetric rendering to learn implicit scene representations, enabling reconstruction of continuous geometry and view-dependent appearance through differential neural rendering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers competitive results using only 70% of training data, demonstrating superior data efficiency across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSLCounter provides an effective self-supervised alternative to fully supervised methods for multi-view counting, significantly reducing annotation requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

*Vahid Mirjalili,Ramin Giahi,Sriram Kollipara,Akshay Kekuda,Kehui Yao,Kai Zhao,Jianpeng Xu,Kaushiki Nag,Sinduja Subramaniam,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark for evaluating object-centric spatial reasoning in vision foundation models, revealing a trade-off between precise localization and relational reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models focus on localization accuracy but lack true spatial understanding of how objects are arranged and related within scenes, which is critical for effective scene understanding.

Method: Used a controlled synthetic dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art vision models and VLMs across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks.

Result: Found a stable trade-off: detectors provide precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs offer coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context.

Conclusion: Highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

*Jiahao Zhang,Bowen Wang,Hong Liu,Yuta Nakashima,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANICL is a training-free framework that improves visual in-context learning by using multiple in-context pairs instead of relying on a single pair, reducing bias and improving stability across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual In-Context Learning often suffers from over-reliance on single in-context pairs, leading to biased and unstable predictions. The authors aim to address this limitation by leveraging multiple examples.

Method: PANICL uses patch-based k-nearest neighbor approach to smooth assignment scores across multiple in-context pairs without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements on foreground segmentation, object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection. The method also demonstrates strong robustness to domain shifts and generalizes well to other VICL models.

Conclusion: PANICL is a versatile and broadly applicable framework that effectively mitigates bias in visual in-context learning through multi-pair utilization, showing strong performance across diverse tasks and models.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

*Jiahui Wang,Haiyue Zhu,Haoren Guo,Abdullah Al Mamun,Cheng Xiang,Tong Heng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D is a lightweight 6D pose estimation pipeline that uses only a single RGB reference image, eliminating the need for depth sensors, multi-view images, or complex training models. It improves depth prediction accuracy and handles challenging materials and lighting conditions through enhanced depth estimation and depth-aware matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have practical limitations: depth-based methods fail with transparent/reflective surfaces, while RGB-based methods struggle in low-light and texture-less scenes due to lack of geometry information. The goal is to create a robust solution that works in resource-limited settings without requiring depth sensors or dense templates.

Method: 1) Token-scaler-based fine-tuning mechanism with novel optimization loss on Depth-Anything v2 for improved depth prediction, especially for challenging surfaces. 2) Depth-aware matching process that integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR to handle challenging materials and lighting conditions.

Result: Achieves 14.41% improvement in depth prediction (δ₁.₀₅) on REAL275 compared to Depth-Anything v2. On pose estimation, surpasses state-of-the-art methods with 6.1% improvement in average recall across REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets.

Conclusion: SingRef6D provides a practical and robust solution for 6D pose estimation that works effectively with only a single RGB reference image, demonstrating strong performance across challenging scenarios including transparent materials, reflective surfaces, and low-light conditions.

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for visual navigation suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting deployment in resource-tight scenarios.

Method: Proposes DynaNav with trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations and integrates feature selection into early-exit mechanism with Bayesian Optimization for optimal exit thresholds.

Result: Achieves 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage compared to ViNT, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.

Conclusion: DynaNav effectively addresses computational efficiency and interpretability issues in visual navigation, making it suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,

### [79] [SemanticControl: A Training-Free Approach for Handling Loosely Aligned Visual Conditions in ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21938)
*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticControl is a training-free method that enables text-to-image diffusion models to effectively use loosely aligned visual conditions by adaptively suppressing conflicting visual guidance and strengthening text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet's effectiveness depends on precisely aligned visual conditions, which are often unavailable for uncommon or imaginative scenes. Existing models struggle with loosely aligned conditions, leading to low text fidelity or artifacts.

Method: Uses an auxiliary denoising process with a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition to extract attention masks, then applies these masks during actual target prompt denoising to suppress conflicting visual guidance.

Result: Improves performance under loosely aligned conditions across various conditions (depth maps, edge maps, human skeletons), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: SemanticControl enables effective use of misaligned but semantically relevant visual conditions without requiring retraining, addressing a key limitation of current ControlNet models.

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Sicheng Zhao,Can Ma,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Emotion Statement Judgment task and automated pipeline to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models' visual emotion perception capabilities, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs' emotion perception have constraints including oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations, leading to inconsistent results.

Method: Developed an Emotion Statement Judgment task and an automated pipeline to efficiently construct emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort for systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs show stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, but have limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. Even top-performing models like GPT4o demonstrate significant performance gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework helps advance emotional intelligence in MLLMs by identifying key areas for improvement and providing comprehensive assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

*Tao Wu,Yibo Jiang,Yehao Lu,Zhizhong Wang,Zeyi Huang,Zequn Qin,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiCrafter is a framework for multi-subject image generation that addresses attribute leakage through explicit positional supervision, uses Mixture-of-Experts for better scenario handling, and employs reinforcement learning for human preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject generation methods suffer from attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives.

Method: 1) Explicit positional supervision to separate attention regions and mitigate attribute leakage 2) Mixture-of-Experts architecture for handling diverse scenarios 3) Online reinforcement learning framework with scoring mechanism for human preference alignment

Result: The framework significantly improves subject fidelity while better aligning with human preferences compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MultiCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in multi-subject image generation through attention separation, enhanced model capacity, and preference alignment, achieving superior performance in preserving subject fidelity and meeting human aesthetic standards.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartSAM is the first promptable 3D part segmentation model trained on large-scale 3D data, achieving superior performance over existing methods by using a triplane-based dual-branch encoder and model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing open-world part segmentation approaches that transfer 2D supervision and fail to capture intrinsic 3D geometry, leading to surface-only understanding and limited generalization.

Method: Uses encoder-decoder architecture with triplane-based dual-branch encoder for scalable part-aware representation learning. Introduces model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline that curates over 5 million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks. Achieves accurate part identification with single prompts and automatic decomposition into surface and internal structures in Segment-Every-Part mode.

Conclusion: PartSAM represents a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding, demonstrating emergent open-world capabilities through scalable architecture and diverse 3D data.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most no-reference image quality assessment models struggle to accurately evaluate contrast distortions under diverse real-world conditions, despite contrast being a fundamental factor in visual perception and image quality.

Method: Customized and fine-tuned three pre-trained architectures (EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, MobileNetV2) with contrast-aware regression heads, trained end-to-end using targeted data augmentations on benchmark datasets CID2013 and CCID2014 containing synthetic and authentic contrast distortions.

Result: EfficientNet B0 achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014, and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and other deep baselines.

Conclusion: Contrast-aware adaptation of lightweight pre-trained networks provides a high-performing, scalable solution for no-reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-R1 is a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring that generates explicit reasoning chains before localizing objects, improving performance in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning struggles with poor generalization in data-scarce scenarios for remote sensing referring expression understanding, which requires complex object-context reasoning.

Method: Proposed Geo-R1 uses reinforcement fine-tuning to enforce models to first generate interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, then use these rationales to localize target objects.

Result: Geo-R1 consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines on three few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The "reason first, then act" paradigm enables more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability for geospatial referring tasks.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates clinical sycophancy in medical VLMs, proposes a benchmark dataset, and introduces VIPER framework to mitigate sycophantic behavior by filtering non-evidentiary content and generating evidence-first responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models in clinical workflows often exhibit sycophantic behavior that prioritizes alignment with user phrasing and social cues over evidence-based reasoning, which poses risks in medical applications.

Method: Created medical sycophancy benchmark from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD datasets using psychologically motivated pressure templates. Proposed VIPER framework that filters non-evidentiary content and generates constrained evidence-first answers.

Result: VLMs are generally vulnerable to sycophancy with significant variations in adversarial responses, showing weak correlation to model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert corrections were most effective triggers, indicating bias mechanisms independent of visual evidence.

Conclusion: The benchmark and VIPER mitigation framework provide groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs, emphasizing the need for evidence-anchored defenses in real-world clinician interactions.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLARIFY is a novel method that uses spatiotemporal gaze data to enhance Vision-Language Models for smart glasses applications, addressing ambiguity in verbal queries and noisy gaze patterns through automatic data synthesis and heatmap integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart glasses integration requires handling ambiguous verbal queries (using pronouns, skipping context) and noisy gaze patterns with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Previous methods using single images fail to capture dynamic user attention.

Method: 1) Analyzed gaze patterns in query samples, 2) Used GPT-4o to create automatic data synthesis pipeline generating GLARIFY-Ambi dataset with chain-of-thought process for noisy gaze, 3) Designed heatmap module to integrate gaze into VLMs while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines on hold-out test set, demonstrating improved effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: GLARIFY enables robust alignment of VLMs with human attention, paving the way for usable and intuitive interaction with visual assistants through smart glasses.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Weili Guan,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs exhibit spatial bias where identical visual information placed at different image positions produces inconsistent outputs, due to unbalanced position embeddings in language models. The proposed BaPA method assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to enhance spatial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Vision-Language Models lack robustness to spatial variations - they produce inconsistent outputs when identical visual information appears at different locations, revealing limitations in spatial-semantic understanding.

Method: Proposed Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to promote balanced integration of visual information across different spatial positions.

Result: BaPA enhances spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and boosts performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Analysis shows BaPA yields balanced attention for more holistic visual understanding.

Conclusion: The spatial bias in LVLMs stems from unbalanced position embedding design in language models, not vision encoders. BaPA effectively mitigates this issue by promoting balanced position assignment, improving both spatial robustness and overall multimodal performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

*Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Aleksandar Cvejic,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for disentangling visual and semantic features from diffusion models to enable visual correspondence and quantify visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models encode both semantic and visual features, but isolating visual features is challenging due to lack of annotated datasets. This work aims to enable visual correspondence similar to semantic correspondence.

Method: Automated pipeline to construct image pairs with annotated semantic/visual correspondences from existing datasets, plus contrastive architecture to separate feature types. Introduces Visual Semantic Matching (VSM) metric.

Result: Outperforms CLIP, DINO, and vision-language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions in subject-driven generation.

Conclusion: First method supporting both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, providing valuable tool for advancing this task.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

TL;DR: WAVE introduces unified audio-visual embeddings using LLMs, enabling any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and prompt-aware embeddings through hierarchical feature fusion and joint multi-modal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLM embeddings are effective for general representations but underutilized for dynamic modalities like audio and video, creating a gap for unified cross-modal representations.

Method: Uses hierarchical feature fusion strategy and joint multi-modal, multi-task training to create unified embeddings for text, audio, and video modalities.

Result: Sets new SOTA on MMEB-v2 video benchmark, superior audio/video-to-audio retrieval, and remarkable performance in multimodal QA, outperforming existing embedding models.

Conclusion: WAVE enables broad cross-modal applications through unified representations and opens possibilities for any-to-any multimodal learning with its versatile approach.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline that first analyzes downsampled images to identify task-relevant regions, then processes only those regions at full resolution, reducing computational costs while preserving necessary visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs incur substantial computational overhead due to processing large numbers of vision tokens. The emergence of 'thinking with images' models enables visual reasoning, motivating a more efficient approach that preserves fine-grained details only where needed.

Method: ERGO uses reasoning-driven perception that leverages multimodal context to determine where to focus, accounting for perceptual uncertainty by expanding cropped regions to cover visually ambiguous areas. It employs reinforcement learning with simple reward components for coarse-to-fine perception.

Result: ERGO achieves higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods with greater efficiency. It surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of vision tokens, achieving 3x inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline with reasoning-driven perception effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating significant efficiency gains for high-resolution image processing in vision-language applications.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

TL;DR: DualFocus is a novel Depth-from-Focus framework that uses dual constraints (spatial and focal) to improve depth estimation accuracy in complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based DFF methods struggle in complex scenes where focus cues become ambiguous due to fine textures or abrupt depth changes, leading to inaccurate depth estimation.

Method: Introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints: spatial constraints analyze gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish depth edges from texture artifacts, and focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with physical focus behavior.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The dual constraint approach with proper inductive biases significantly improves robustness and accuracy in challenging depth estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that uses information theory to optimize the trade-off between task performance and communication volume in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks theoretical foundation for the performance-communication trade-off in collaborative perception. The authors aim to fill this gap using information theory.

Method: Proposes RDcomm framework with two key innovations: 1) task entropy discrete coding that assigns task-relevant codeword-lengths, and 2) mutual-information-driven message selection to reduce redundancy.

Result: RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V datasets while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides conditions for optimal communication strategies, and RDcomm demonstrates practical effectiveness in balancing performance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: Static benchmarks have limited diagnostic power for uncovering systematic failures in T2I models and identifying their root causes, necessitating a complementary active exploration paradigm.

Method: FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal, failure-inducing concepts and makes this computationally explosive problem tractable with novel acceleration techniques.

Result: Applied to Stable Diffusion models, the method uncovered over 247,000 previously unknown error slices in SD1.5 alone and provided large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training set.

Conclusion: FailureAtlas establishes a new diagnostic-first methodology for deep model auditing that can guide the development of more robust generative AI.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, self-supervised method that reduces hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by using text-to-image projection to create negative anchors and editing decoder hidden states to push representations away from hallucination directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs suffer from persistent hallucinations that produce fluent but visually inconsistent content, and existing mitigation approaches require finetuning, handcrafted priors, or compromise scalability and informativeness.

Method: Uses hallucination amplification: projects captions into visual space via text-to-image model to create negative anchors, uses original images as positive anchors, and edits decoder hidden states by pulling toward faithful semantics and pushing away from hallucination directions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations at object, attribute, and relation levels while preserving recall and caption richness, achieving over 5% hallucination reduction on CHAIR with LLaVA-v1.5-7B, and shows strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The method provides effective, efficient hallucination mitigation without training costs or human priors, maintains robustness on hallucination-free captions, and offers practical plug-and-play applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT is a training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition through iterative Foresight-Focus Thought cycles, improving performance by 3.1-5.8% across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are constrained by complex and redundant visual input, making them susceptible to interference and hallucinations due to inability to precisely discover and process required regions during reasoning.

Method: Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT) with three iterative stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation for exploring reasoning paths, (2) Dual Foresight Decoding to evaluate samples based on visual focus and reasoning progression, (3) Visual Focus Adjustment to precisely adjust focus toward beneficial regions.

Result: Consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next, with controllable computational overhead.

Conclusion: CoFFT effectively enhances VLM visual reasoning by creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning, addressing limitations of current VLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy on Video-MME benchmark and custom clinical dataset, with improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for applications in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support in healthcare robotics.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

*Yuki Sakai,Ryosuke Furuta,Juichun Yen,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new egocentric video dataset for analyzing face-to-face instructional interactions and benchmarks multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional models for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face instructional scenes have not been systematically studied in computer vision due to lack of suitable datasets and limited analytical techniques, despite being critical for educational support and skill transfer.

Method: The authors present a new egocentric video dataset with ground-truth annotations and benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that jointly process images, audio, and text against conventional task-specific models.

Result: MLLMs outperform specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions that involve multiple modalities (speech content/prosody, gaze/body motion, visual context).

Conclusion: The study shows that current MLLMs have strong potential for understanding face-to-face instructional scenes and handling verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

*Chao Huang,Susan Liang,Yapeng Tian,Anurag Kumar,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS is a generative audio-visual separation framework that uses diffusion models (DDPM and Flow Matching) to directly synthesize separated sound spectrograms from noise, conditioned on mixed audio and visual inputs, achieving superior separation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based regression methods for sound separation have limitations in capturing complex data distributions needed for high-quality separation across diverse sound categories.

Method: Uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching within a Separation U-Net architecture to generate separated sound spectrograms directly from noise distribution, conditioned on mixed audio and visual information.

Result: Both DDPM and Flow Matching variants of DAVIS surpass existing methods on AVE and MUSIC datasets, demonstrating superior separation quality.

Conclusion: Generative modeling paradigms are effective for audio-visual source separation, with DAVIS showing improved performance over traditional regression-based approaches.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecXNet is a dual-domain deepfake detection architecture that combines spatial and spectral features using Dual-Domain Feature Coupler and Dual Fourier Attention modules to achieve robust performance across various manipulation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs and diffusion models create increasingly realistic deepfakes, making detection challenging. Existing methods focusing only on spatial or frequency features lack generalization to unseen manipulations.

Method: Uses Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC) with local spatial branch for texture anomalies and global spectral branch with FFT for periodic inconsistencies. Includes Dual Fourier Attention (DFA) for dynamic feature fusion, built on modified XceptionNet backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple deepfake benchmarks, especially in cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: Unified spatial-spectral learning is effective for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. Code is publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

*Jingrui Ye,Lingting Zhu,Runze Zhang,Zeyu Hu,Yingda Yin,Lanjiong Li,Lequan Yu,Qingmin Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGM is a framework that generates 3D content with PBR materials (albedo, roughness, metallic) using multiview material diffusion and Gaussian material representation, enabling dynamic relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction models fail to produce material properties needed for realistic rendering in diverse lighting environments, limiting practical applications.

Method: Fine-tune multiview material diffusion model conditioned on depth/normal maps, then use Gaussian material representation to model PBR channels from generated multiview images.

Result: Produces visually appealing materials that enhance material modeling and enable practical downstream rendering applications with dynamic relighting.

Conclusion: MGM successfully generates high-quality 3D content with PBR materials, overcoming limitations of previous RGB-only approaches and enabling realistic rendering in various lighting conditions.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel self-supervised point cloud completion method using multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture to overcome limitations of existing supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion methods have limitations: supervised methods rely on ground truth and suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap; unsupervised methods need complete point clouds; weakly-supervised methods require multi-view observations; existing self-supervised methods produce unsatisfactory predictions due to limited self-supervised signals.

Method: Designs novel self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of single partial point clouds. Incorporates Mamba architecture into self-supervised point cloud completion to enhance learning ability and generate better quality point clouds.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively overcomes limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance in point cloud completion tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome high resource demands of conditional image generation models and privacy concerns from sending user data to third parties, especially for edge device deployment.

Method: Uses semi-supervised distillation with tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different knowledge levels, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance generalization.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability.

Conclusion: Refine-Control provides an effective solution for deploying efficient conditional image generation on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising quality.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

TL;DR: JGEKD is a classification strategy for non-IID 3D point clouds that uses joint graph entropy knowledge distillation to capture class correlations and improve robustness against corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D point cloud classification assumes IID data, which ignores important class correlations. This paper addresses the need for methods that can handle non-IID data while preserving class relationships.

Method: The method constructs joint graphs to capture hidden class relationships and uses knowledge distillation with joint graph entropy loss. It employs Siamese structures with self-knowledge and teacher-knowledge distillation frameworks to handle spatial transformation invariance and improve robustness against corruption.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanObject, ModelNet40, ScanntV2_cls and ModelNet-C datasets demonstrate that JGEKD achieves competitive classification results.

*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat is a multimodal program synthesis framework that uses large multimodal models to generate procedural material graphs from both visual and textual representations, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural program synthesis methods only use textual representations, failing to capture the visual-spatial nature of material node graphs that makes them intuitive for humans. There's a need to bridge this gap between visual understanding and program generation.

Method: Leverages large multimodal models trained on production-quality procedural materials dataset, combined with constrained tree search inference algorithm to ensure syntactic validity while efficiently exploring program space.

Result: MultiMat achieves higher efficiency in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with superior visual quality and fidelity compared to text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal program synthesis that incorporates both visual and textual representations significantly improves procedural material graph generation, better capturing the intuitive visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to human users.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and interpretability of latent space manipulation in GANs by combining dimensionality reduction with intuitive image editing capabilities.

Method: Combines StyleGAN's structured latent space with DragGAN's intuitive manipulation and PCA for dimensionality reduction and cross-model alignment, applied to AFHQ dataset.

Result: PCA integration reduces optimization time while maintaining visual quality and boosting SSIM, especially in shallower latent spaces. Successfully aligns images from different domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat) for interpretable manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and interpretable latent space control for image synthesis and editing applications, demonstrating potential for wide applicability.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Motivation: To develop an efficient document parsing model that can handle high-resolution inputs without computational overhead while preserving fine-grained details in complex document elements like dense text, formulas, and tables.

Method: Two-stage parsing strategy: 1) Efficient layout analysis on downsampled images for global structure, 2) Targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops guided by layout analysis. Supported by a comprehensive data engine for generating diverse training corpora.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability with optimal balance between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency through its innovative two-stage parsing approach.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local

analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving

TL;DR: Geo-CoT framework enables verifiable multi-step reasoning in remote sensing by using supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models in remote sensing fail at complex analytical tasks due to end-to-end training that bypasses reasoning steps and produces unverifiable outputs.

Method: Two-stage alignment strategy: supervised fine-tuning to instill cognitive architecture, then Group Reward Policy Optimization to refine reasoning policy. Uses Geo-CoT380k dataset of structured rationales.

Result: RSThinker model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across comprehensive tasks, providing both final answers and verifiable analytical traces.

Conclusion: The framework provides a pathway from opaque perception to structured, verifiable reasoning in Earth Observation, with public release of dataset and model.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat is a training-free framework that lifts 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes without per-scene retraining, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from costly per-scene retraining, monosemous design that fails to represent multi-concept semantics, and vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D segmentation to generate multi-granularity 2D masks, lifts them to 3D, estimates foreground probabilities, optimizes boundaries using semantic entropy and geometric opacity, and uses VLM to distill robust textual features for open-vocabulary querying.

Result: Reduces scene adaptation time from hours to minutes, outperforms training-based frameworks on open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MUSplat successfully eliminates costly per-scene training while addressing monosemous limitations and achieving superior performance in open-vocabulary 3D understanding.

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

TL;DR: UrbanFeel is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' urban development understanding and subjective perception, featuring 14.3K visual questions across static scene perception, temporal change understanding, and subjective environmental perception dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs in urban environments are limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception aligned with human perception.

Method: Collected multi-temporal street-view images from 11 cities worldwide and generated question-answer pairs through spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro achieved best overall performance, approaching human expert levels with only 1.5% gap. Models perform well on scene understanding tasks, some surpassing humans in pixel-level change detection, but struggle with temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: MLLMs show strong capabilities in urban scene understanding and subjective perception, with some reaching human-level consistency in dimensions like beauty and safety, but temporal reasoning remains a challenge.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXCL is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation method that uses dual experts (source model with Conv-Adapter and vision-language model) and a retrieval-augmentation-interaction pipeline to adapt models without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and cost concerns in domain adaptation by adapting source-trained models to target domains without accessing source data, overcoming limitations of existing methods that neglect complementary insights and target data structure.

Method: Dual Experts framework with frozen source model + Conv-Adapter and vision-language model + trainable text prompt, trained via Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction pipeline with three stages: collaborative sample retrieval, separate expert fine-tuning, and learning object consistency enforcement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art matching performance.

Conclusion: EXCL effectively addresses SFUDA challenges by leveraging dual experts and retrieval-augmented interaction, achieving competitive performance without source data access.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided image editing with diffusion models suffers from prohibitive latency that hinders real-world applications, despite achieving remarkable quality.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline bypassing iterative processes; (2) Background Shield (BG-Shield) for selective feature modification only in edit regions; (3) Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA) mechanism to suppress semantic leakage.

Result: FlashEdit performs edits in under 0.2 seconds (150x speedup compared to prior methods) while maintaining superior background consistency and structural integrity.

Conclusion: FlashEdit provides a practical solution for real-time image editing with diffusion models, balancing speed and quality effectively for real-world applications.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural-MedBench is a compact, reasoning-intensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology, revealing significant performance drops in state-of-the-art vision-language models compared to conventional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks focus too much on classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion where models appear proficient but fail at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. There's a need to assess true clinical reasoning abilities.

Method: Created Neural-MedBench integrating multi-sequence MRI scans, EHRs, and clinical notes with three task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. Used hybrid scoring with LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-4, MedGemma) showed sharp performance drops compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis revealed reasoning failures dominate model shortcomings rather than perceptual errors.

Conclusion: Proposes Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented datasets for statistical generalization and depth-oriented benchmarks like Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. Released as open testbed for rigorous assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

*Yujian Yuan,Changjie Wu,Xinyuan Chang,Sijin Wang,Hang Zhang,Shiyi Liang,Shuang Zeng,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen is a generative framework for large-scale map construction that uses discrete sequence representation and multi-modal inputs to create complete, smooth maps while overcoming satellite data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction methods are costly and inefficient, while existing satellite-based approaches suffer from data limitations (occlusions, outdatedness) and produce rough, discontinuous roads that require extensive post-processing.

Method: Represents lane lines as discrete sequences with iterative generation, supports multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text prompts), and uses state update strategy for global continuity and consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenSatMap dataset, can infer occluded roads and predict missing roads from dataset annotations.

Conclusion: UniMapGen provides an efficient generative framework for large-scale map construction that overcomes limitations of traditional methods and satellite-based approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

*Dinh Minh Nguyen,Malte Avenhaus,Thomas Lindemeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-2M is a unified framework for mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieving high-quality results without relying on external priors or complex neural components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods handle mesh reconstruction and material decomposition separately, struggle with reflective surfaces, and often require external priors. Current joint approaches use sophisticated neural components that limit scalability.

Method: Joint optimization of attributes for rendered depth and normals using 3D Gaussian Splatting, with a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation and carefully designed loss functions.

Result: Produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and material components while being resilient to reflective surfaces and maintaining geometric details.

Conclusion: The unified GS-2M framework effectively solves mesh reconstruction and material decomposition together without complex neural components, validated on widely used datasets with competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MesaTask-10K dataset and MesaTask framework for generating task-oriented tabletop scenes using spatial reasoning chains and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for creating tabletop scenes rely on manual design or random layouts, which lack plausibility or task alignment. There's a need for automated generation of realistic tabletop scenes that match specific task instructions.

Method: Proposes a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes generation into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction. Uses LLM-based framework enhanced with DPO algorithms.

Result: MesaTask outperforms baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts, as demonstrated through exhaustive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between task instructions and 3D tabletop scene generation, producing physically plausible scenes that align well with given tasks.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

*Michael Jungo,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rule-based reinforcement learning improves document image classification with better generalization to out-of-distribution data across images, classes, and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of rule-based reinforcement learning in document analysis, particularly for enhancing reasoning capabilities and generalization in document image classification tasks.

Method: Applied rule-based reinforcement learning to document image classification, testing generalization across three scenarios: out-of-distribution images, unseen classes, and different modalities.

Result: Reinforcement learning demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to traditional methods, performing well on out-of-distribution data in all three tested scenarios.

Conclusion: Rule-based reinforcement learning is effective for document analysis tasks, offering improved generalization to diverse data distributions and modalities.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

### [117] [Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292)
*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit is a black-box jailbreak method for Text-to-Video models that fragments harmful narratives into multiple benign scenes, manipulating the generative output space to bypass safety filters and produce harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video models have significant safety risks that remain largely unexplored compared to other AI models like LLMs and T2I models, creating a critical safety gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: SceneSplit fragments harmful narratives into individually benign scenes, uses sequential scene combination to constrain the output space to unsafe regions, employs iterative scene manipulation to bypass safety filters, and utilizes a strategy library to reuse successful attack patterns.

Result: SceneSplit achieves high attack success rates of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2 across 11 safety categories, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: Current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks exploiting narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving T2V model safety.

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a momentum-based sampling technique that improves diffusion model outputs by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step, enhancing image quality and efficiency without extra computation or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models still produce unrealistic outputs with lacking fine details when using fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance scales.

Method: History-guided sampling (HiGS) leverages the difference between current prediction and weighted average of past predictions to steer sampling toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure.

Result: HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256×256 with only 30 sampling steps instead of standard 250.

Conclusion: HiGS serves as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity, requiring no additional training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: VeloxSeg is a lightweight 3D medical image segmentation framework that addresses the efficiency/robustness conflict through a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution, achieving significant performance improvements and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental 'efficiency/robustness conflict' in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, particularly for complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities, by redesigning the framework based on high-dimensional 3D image characteristics and exploring data synergy.

Method: Uses a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention (PWA) for multi-scale information retrieval and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC) for robust local feature extraction. Incorporates modal interaction in multi-scale retrieval and Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices to inject texture priors from self-supervised networks.

Result: Achieves 26% Dice improvement on multimodal benchmarks while increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU throughput by 48x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VeloxSeg successfully addresses the efficiency/robustness trade-off in lightweight 3D medical segmentation through its innovative dual-stream architecture and knowledge transfer approach, delivering superior performance with dramatically improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3 is a framework that accelerates Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by using three lightweight policy heads to make per-image adaptive decisions for step skipping, feature caching, and sparse attention, achieving nearly 3x faster sampling without updating the base generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT acceleration methods use uniform heuristics for all images, sacrificing quality, while dynamic networks require costly fine-tuning. RAPID3 aims to provide image-wise adaptive acceleration with zero updates to the base model.

Method: Uses three policy heads (Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, Sparse-Attention) that observe denoising states and make independent acceleration decisions per timestep. Trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with frozen generator, augmented by an adversarial discriminator to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Achieves nearly 3x faster sampling across state-of-the-art DiT backbones (Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX) while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: RAPID3 provides effective per-image adaptive acceleration for DiTs without requiring model updates, significantly improving inference speed while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal knowledge graph approach for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) that leverages relationships between visual features, attribute text, and contextual information to improve recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAR methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information, and existing approaches using attribute text as additional input are still in early development stages.

Method: Constructs a multi-modal knowledge graph to mine relationships between local visual features and text, and between attributes and visual context samples. Introduces a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph approach for PAR tasks.

Conclusion: The method establishes a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition and the source code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

TL;DR: CircuitSense is a benchmark evaluating MLLMs' ability to extract mathematical models from technical circuit diagrams, revealing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning in engineering design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs excel at natural image tasks, their capability to derive mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored, despite being crucial for engineering design workflows that require hierarchical abstraction from system specifications to component implementations.

Method: Created CircuitSense benchmark with 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams, using a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline with grid-based schematic generator and block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.

Result: Closed-source models achieve >85% accuracy on perception tasks but <19% on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning consistently achieve higher design task accuracy.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning is identified as the key metric for engineering competence, with mathematical understanding being fundamental for circuit synthesis and establishing a critical gap that needs to be addressed in MLLM development for engineering applications.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

TL;DR: HierLight-YOLO enhances real-time small object detection for drone imagery using hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone2019.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YOLO detectors struggle with high false negative rates for small objects in drone photography, while needing to maintain real-time efficiency on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Proposes HierLight-YOLO based on YOLOv8 with Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN) for multi-scale feature fusion, plus IRDCB and LDown lightweight modules to reduce parameters/computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone2019 benchmark, demonstrating improved small object detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO effectively addresses the dual challenges of detecting small targets in drone imagery and maintaining real-time performance through hierarchical fusion and lightweight design.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

*Kaziwa Saleh,Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using GPT-4 with specialized prompts to predict occlusion order between objects in images without training data, achieving better accuracy than baselines through semantic context and commonsense reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion is a major challenge for vision models in interpreting complex real-world scenes, requiring robust methods to predict object occlusion relationships.

Method: Leverage pre-trained GPT-4 with designed prompts to analyze images and generate occlusion order predictions, then parse responses to construct occlusion matrices for downstream tasks.

Result: Evaluation on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets shows improved accuracy over baseline methods by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge.

Conclusion: GPT-4 enables zero-shot occlusion reasoning without annotated training data, providing an easily integrable solution for occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

*Haoyu Li,XiaoSong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-focus image fusion method using significant boundary enhancement to generate high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and loss of focused details.

Method: Proposes a gradient-domain-based model for initial fusion with complete boundaries, Tenengrad gradient detection for salient feature extraction, and a focus metric integrating gradient and complementary information for boundary refinement.

Result: Outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances boundary quality in multi-focus image fusion, producing superior results compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

### [128] [Text Adversarial Attacks with Dynamic Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22393)
*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDOA is a novel text adversarial attack method that handles dynamic-output scenarios by converting them to static scenarios using clustering-based surrogate models, achieving high attack success rates with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text adversarial attack methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed output labels and predefined label spaces, which limits their applicability to dynamic-output scenarios common in real-world applications.

Method: Uses clustering-based surrogate model training to convert dynamic-output scenarios into static single-output scenarios, and employs farthest-label targeted attack strategy to maximize disruption by selecting adversarial vectors that deviate most from model's coarse-grained labels.

Result: Achieves maximum attack success rate of 50.81% with single query per text on dynamic-output scenarios, and 82.68% on static scenarios. Also extends to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Conclusion: TDOA effectively addresses dynamic-output scenarios in text adversarial attacks, demonstrates strong performance with limited model access, and shows potential to compromise large language models while also excelling in conventional static scenarios.

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to incorporate medical background knowledge into semantic segmentation models, improving performance especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning segmentation systems have limitations and performance can be improved by incorporating medical domain knowledge into the loss function.

Method: Use Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic rules, combined with SwinUNETR architecture in an end-to-end framework for hippocampus segmentation in brain MRI.

Result: LTNs improved baseline segmentation performance, particularly when training data was scarce.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic methods like LTNs are general enough to be adapted to other medical semantic segmentation tasks, though the approach is still in preliminary stages.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VARE and S-VARE frameworks for stable concept erasure in visual autoregressive models, addressing safety concerns in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure techniques designed for diffusion models fail to work with VAR models due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm, creating safety gaps in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Method: VARE uses auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity, while S-VARE incorporates filtered cross entropy loss to identify unsafe visual tokens and preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, preventing language drift and diversity reduction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, effectively closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed VARE and S-VARE frameworks successfully enable stable concept erasure in VAR models, addressing critical safety concerns without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

### [131] [RAU: Reference-based Anatomical Understanding with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22404)
*Yiwei Li,Yikang Liu,Jiaqi Guo,Lin Zhao,Zheyuan Zhang,Xiao Chen,Boris Mailhe,Ankush Mukherjee,Terrence Chen,Shanhui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAU is a framework that uses vision-language models for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical imaging, enabling identification, localization and segmentation of anatomical structures by leveraging spatial reasoning between reference and target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical understanding in medical imaging is constrained by scarcity of expert-labeled data. Reference-based approaches using annotated images can help interpret unlabeled targets, but current vision-language models have limited reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization capabilities.

Method: RAU combines VLM spatial reasoning with SAM2's segmentation capability. First trains VLM on relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images using VQA and bounding box prediction. Then integrates VLM-derived spatial cues with SAM2 for pixel-level segmentation of small anatomical regions.

Result: RAU outperforms SAM2 fine-tuning baseline across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, achieving more accurate segmentations and reliable localization. Shows strong generalization ability crucial for medical applications.

Conclusion: RAU is the first framework exploring VLM capabilities for reference-based anatomical identification, localization and segmentation in medical images. Its performance demonstrates potential for VLM-driven approaches in automated clinical workflows.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias addresses spectral bias in deepfake detectors by using frequency debiasing through Forgery Mixup augmentation and dual consistency regularization to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often fail to generalize to unseen forgery types due to spectral bias - over-reliance on specific frequency bands learned from limited training data.

Method: Proposes FreqDebias framework with two strategies: 1) Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation to diversify frequency characteristics, and 2) dual consistency regularization using class activation maps (local) and von Mises-Fisher distribution on hyperspherical embeddings (global).

Result: Extensive experiments show FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

Conclusion: FreqDebias effectively mitigates spectral bias in deepfake detectors through frequency debiasing, improving generalization across diverse forgery types.

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux is a caption-free universal image restoration framework that adapts Flux.1 diffusion transformer without image captions, using a dual-branch conditioner and adaptive modulation to preserve semantics while restoring degraded images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift when recovering images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics. There's a need for robust universal image restoration without relying on text prompts or captions.

Method: Uses lightweight dual-branch conditioner to inject signals from degraded input and lightly restored proxy; timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule; enforces caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features; scalable curation pipeline for structure-rich supervision.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks. Ablation studies verify necessity of each component.

Conclusion: For large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on - rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts - is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to improve interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models by addressing intra-modal dependencies in both visual and textual modalities, overcoming limitations of existing cross-modal attribution approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM interpretability research focuses mainly on cross-modal attribution but overlooks intra-modal dependencies, leading to fragmented visual explanations and spurious textual activations that compromise attribution fidelity.

Method: Two main approaches: 1) Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) for visual branch - aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to adjust receptive fields dynamically; 2) Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC) for textual branch - measures relevance of contextual tokens via top-k prediction ranking alignment to suppress spurious activations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets, producing more faithful and fine-grained explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed intra-modal interaction enhancement methods significantly improve MLLM interpretability by addressing both visual spatial context limitations and textual spurious activation issues, yielding more coherent and reliable explanations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

TL;DR: U-MAN enhances U-Net with Multi-scale Adaptive KAN and Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion to improve medical image segmentation by addressing semantic gaps and enabling multi-scale feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional U-Net architectures struggle with preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries in medical images due to semantic gaps in skip connections and lack of multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers.

Method: Proposed U-MAN architecture with two modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) replaces simple skip connections using attention mechanisms, and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) enables adaptive multi-scale feature processing.

Result: U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (BUSI, GLAS, CVC), particularly excelling in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Conclusion: The proposed U-MAN architecture effectively addresses limitations of conventional U-Nets and demonstrates superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes γ-Quant, a method for learning task-specific non-linear quantization to enable pattern recognition on low-bit-depth sensor data, achieving comparable performance to high-bit data while reducing bandwidth and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pattern recognition models use pre-processed data optimized for human perception, but this is inefficient for automated analysis in low-bandwidth, energy-constrained settings where sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture.

Method: Proposed γ-Quant, which learns task-specific non-linear quantization for pattern recognition. Applied to raw-image object detection and human activity recognition from wearable sensor data.

Result: Raw data with learnable quantization using only 4-bits performs on par with raw 12-bit data, demonstrating significant efficiency gains without performance loss.

Conclusion: Task-specific learnable quantization enables efficient pattern recognition in low-bandwidth, energy-constrained environments while maintaining performance comparable to high-bit-depth data.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for segmentation-oriented visible and infrared image fusion that eliminates the need for labeled segmentation data by leveraging cross-segmentation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Application-oriented VIF methods require expensive labeled datasets for downstream tasks like segmentation. This paper addresses the data acquisition bottleneck by proposing a self-supervised approach.

Method: Proposes SSVIF framework using cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation. Includes two-stage training strategy and dynamic weight adjustment for joint learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented methods, despite being trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs.

Conclusion: The self-supervised framework effectively learns high-level semantic features without segmentation labels, providing a practical solution to the data labeling problem in application-oriented VIF.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### [138] [Bézier Meets Diffusion: Robust Generation Across Domains for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22476)
*Chen Li,Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Weimin Lyu,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Bézier Meets Diffusion framework for cross-domain medical image generation using Bézier-curve style transfer and conditional diffusion models to address domain gap challenges in unsupervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities due to large domain gaps, and overcome limitations of GAN-based style transfer methods that struggle with high variability regions.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Bézier-curve-based style transfer to reduce domain gap and train robust segmentation model, 2) Conditional diffusion model trained with pseudo-labels from segmentation model, enhanced by uncertainty-guided score matching to handle noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augments target domain data, and improves segmentation performance across domains.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in medical imaging by combining Bézier-curve style transfer with conditional diffusion models, producing high-quality synthetic data that enhances segmentation robustness.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [139] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS is a plug-and-play module that reduces computational overhead in event-based vision by progressively selecting spatio-temporal tokens, achieving 29-43.6% FLOPs reduction and 21.6-41.3% FPS improvement while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods convert event streams to event frames but neglect spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy, leading to computational inefficiency. Token sparsification methods for RGB videos are unreliable for event data due to intermediate token dependency and event noise.

Method: PSTTS uses two stages: Spatial Token Purification (removes noise and non-event regions via spatio-temporal consistency assessment) and Temporal Token Selection (removes redundant temporal information by evaluating motion pattern similarity between adjacent frames). It's parameter-free and plug-and-play.

Result: Applied to UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Achieved 29-43.6% FLOPs reduction and 21.6-41.3% FPS improvement on DailyDVS-200 while maintaining task accuracy.

Conclusion: PSTTS effectively addresses computational inefficiency in event-based vision by leveraging raw event characteristics for token sparsification, achieving optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off without additional parameters.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

### [140] [Group Critical-token Policy Optimization for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22485)
*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,JingHao Zhang,Yaning Pan,Mingde Yao,Jie Xiao,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCPO is a method that identifies critical tokens in autoregressive visual generation and applies targeted policy optimization to only 30% of tokens, achieving better performance than full-token optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, but different tokens contribute unequally to training effectiveness. The key challenge is identifying and optimizing critical tokens efficiently.

Method: Identifies critical tokens from three perspectives: causal dependency (early tokens), entropy-induced spatial structure (high entropy gradient tokens), and RLVR-focused token diversity (low similarity tokens). Uses dynamic token-wise advantage weight based on confidence divergence between policy and reference models.

Result: GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens while using only 30% of image tokens. Validated on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal models.

Conclusion: Targeted optimization on critical tokens is more effective than uniform optimization across all tokens in RLVR-based autoregressive visual generation.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

*Ruoyu Chen,Xiaoqing Guo,Kangwei Liu,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE is a lightweight black-box framework that explains token generation in multimodal LLMs by attributing tokens to compact perceptual regions and quantifying language vs. perceptual influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack understanding of how generated tokens depend on visual modalities, limiting interpretability and reliability.

Method: Uses an objective function unifying sufficiency and indispensability scores, optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for efficient attribution. Performs modality-aware analysis to disentangle token dependencies.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis while requiring substantially less GPU memory.

Conclusion: EAGLE provides effective and practical interpretability for MLLMs, advancing understanding of model decisions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but struggle with non-prototypical colors, with language model architecture significantly influencing color naming independent of visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether VLMs name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction, as color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and communication.

Method: Systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across 5 VLMs using 957 color samples, replicating classic color naming methodologies, with cross-linguistic analysis across 9 languages and ablation studies.

Result: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but performance drops significantly on expanded non-prototypical sets. 21 common color terms emerge consistently across models, with constrained models using basic terms and expansive models using systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis shows severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities, and current VLMs exhibit limitations in color naming that differ from human patterns, particularly for non-prototypical colors and across languages.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

TL;DR: EfficientDepth is a monocular depth estimation system that combines transformer architecture with lightweight convolutional decoder and bimodal density head to achieve geometric consistency, fine details, and efficiency for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods fail to meet requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges, and efficiency for edge devices.

Method: Combines transformer architecture with lightweight convolutional decoder and bimodal density head; trained on labeled synthetic/real images and pseudo-labeled real images; uses multi-stage optimization strategy and LPIPS-based loss function.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational resources.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth successfully addresses key challenges in monocular depth estimation while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Result: Key findings show that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training benefit category discovery. Challenges remain in label assignment design, class number estimation, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: The survey provides a comprehensive review of category discovery literature, identifies current challenges, and points to promising future research directions. A living survey is maintained on GitHub for ongoing updates.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy

discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

*Mohammad Mahdi Hemmatyar,Mahdi Jafari,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Mohammad Reza Nemati,Mobin Azadani,Hamid Reza Rastad,Amirmohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD is a hybrid SSL-LLM model for complex video anomaly detection that combines self-supervised learning for temporal analysis with LLM semantic validation, achieving 72.5% AUC on ComplexVAD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods struggle with semantic understanding of complex anomalies involving multiple entities and temporal dependencies, while LLMs lack fine-grained spatial localization and are computationally expensive for frame analysis.

Method: Hybrid approach combining multi-task SSL temporal analyzer (nnFormer backbone) with LLM validator. SSL identifies suspected anomaly frames, then LLM applies structured rule-based reasoning for semantic validation.

Result: Achieves 72.5% frame-level AUC on ComplexVAD dataset, outperforming baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

Conclusion: HyCoVAD effectively bridges the gap between low-level pattern modeling and high-level semantic reasoning for complex video anomaly detection, with released resources to support future research.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

*Shuang Zeng,Dekang Qi,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Shiyi Liang,Mu Xu,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN proposes a dual implicit neural memory framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as compact neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance while avoiding computational redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods relying on explicit semantic memory suffer from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. The work is inspired by human navigation's implicit scene representation, analogous to left brain semantic understanding and right brain spatial cognition.

Method: Extends MLLM with 3D prior knowledge from spatial-geometric encoder to enhance spatial reasoning. Constructs dual implicit memory from historical key-value caches of spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders, retaining only KVs of tokens in initial and sliding windows to enable efficient incremental updates.

Result: Outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. Success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input, and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data.

Conclusion: The dual implicit neural memory represents a novel paradigm that explores promising new directions for future VLN research, demonstrating that compact neural representations can effectively model both spatial and semantic information for efficient navigation.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Motivation: Semi-supervised learning methods for spiking neural networks remain underexplored compared to artificial neural networks, despite SNNs' biological plausibility and energy efficiency advantages.

Method: Uses temporal dynamics through SNN leakage factors for diverse pseudo-labeling in a co-training framework. Generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on strongly-augmented ones, mitigating confirmation bias.

Result: Outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpikeMatch effectively enables semi-supervised learning for SNNs by leveraging their temporal characteristics and co-training framework to work with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is explored as an alternative to RGB vision encoders for vision-language pipelines, offering compact representation with 3-20x compression and faster fitting while maintaining meaningful zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address structural inefficiencies in current vision-language pipelines: (i) high energy/cost of transmitting dense RGB images from edge to cloud, and (ii) patch-based tokenization that explodes sequence length and stresses attention budgets.

Method: Develop scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance-aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels; adapt CLIP training to 2DGS by reusing frozen RGB transformer backbone with lightweight splat-aware input stem and perceiver resampler, training only ~7% of parameters.

Result: Achieved over 90x faster fitting and ~97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations; GS encoders yield meaningful zero-shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs 3-20x relative to pixels; accuracy currently trails RGB encoders.

Conclusion: 2DGS is established as a viable multimodal substrate that opens a path toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission-efficient for edge-cloud learning, with identified architectural bottlenecks for future improvement.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive is an autoregressive framework for real-time long video generation that addresses efficiency and quality challenges through causal attention, KV-recache mechanism, streaming long tuning, and frame sink attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation faces efficiency issues with diffusion models and quality degradation with AR models. Interactive capabilities like streaming prompts are needed for dynamic content creation but increase complexity in maintaining visual consistency.

Method: Uses causal frame-level AR design with KV-recache mechanism for prompt switching, streaming long tuning for long video training, and short window attention with frame sink for long-range consistency.

Result: Fine-tuned 1.3B-parameter model to minute-long generation in 32 GPU-days, achieves 20.7 FPS on H100, strong VBench performance, supports 240-second videos, and INT8 quantization with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: LongLive successfully addresses long video generation challenges by combining efficient AR inference with mechanisms to maintain quality and support interactive capabilities.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

Motivation: To address the high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch in RLHF, and the wasted supervision in RLVR by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update.

Method: Recycles rollouts and correctness data to simultaneously train the model as a generative reward model using mixed objectives (pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses), creating a co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.

Result: Significant performance gains on multiple benchmarks: SPARK-VL-7B achieved 9.7% average gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over baselines.

Conclusion: SPARK provides an efficient, on-policy, and stable framework that eliminates the need for separate reward models and human preference data, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization across LLM and LVLM models.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCNeXt is a novel self-supervised CNN architecture for depth estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation is crucial for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR applications that operate under computational constraints. Stereo image pairs provide an effective solution, but ground-truth depth data is difficult to acquire across diverse scenarios.

Method: Proposes CCNeXt architecture with modern CNN feature extractor, novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in encoder, and comprehensive redesign of depth estimation decoder.

Result: Achieves competitive metrics on KITTI Eigen Split test data while being 10.18x faster than current best model, and achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics on KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets.

Conclusion: CCNeXt provides an efficient and effective self-supervised solution for depth estimation that balances computational cost with performance, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

### [152] [UML-CoT: Structured Reasoning and Planning with Unified Modeling Language for Robotic Room Cleaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22628)
*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT is a structured reasoning framework that uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create symbolic chain-of-thought reasoning and executable action plans, outperforming traditional unstructured CoT in embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting relies on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Existing structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs are limited to low-order relations and lack constructs for inheritance, behavioral abstraction, and standardized planning semantics.

Method: UML-CoT uses UML class diagrams to capture compositional object semantics and activity diagrams to model procedural control flow. It employs a three-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data.

Result: Evaluated on MRoom-30k benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios, UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success.

Conclusion: UML provides a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism for embodied reasoning tasks compared to traditional unstructured CoT approaches.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot is a data curation deep research agent for computer vision that uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools for calibrated discovery, controllable synthesis, and consensus annotation of visual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes.

Method: A central orchestrator agent powered by a large multimodal language model uses multi-step reasoning to execute three core capabilities: Calibrated Discovery for sourcing relevant data, Controllable Synthesis for generating novel data for rare scenarios, and Consensus Annotation that produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism.

Result: On COCO dataset, achieved 14.2 candidate proposals per image (nearly double ground-truth objects) with 37.1% mAP. On Open Images, discovered 903 new bounding box categories (total 1500+). Calibrated Discovery was 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives at 10-million sample scale.

Conclusion: An agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIPSY is a training-free approach for few-shot image classification that uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate discriminative synthetic images without model fine-tuning or external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification faces challenges due to limited labeled examples, and existing methods often require extensive fine-tuning or external information sources.

Method: Uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation with three innovations: extended classifier-free guidance for independent positive/negative conditioning, class similarity-based sampling for contrastive examples, and a simple pipeline without fine-tuning or external captioning/filtering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across ten benchmark datasets, eliminating need for generative model adaptation or external tools.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, especially for fine-grained classification.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

*Amandeep Kumar,Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that autoregressive transformers with Markovian attention masks are mathematically equivalent to discrete diffusion models, establishing a bridge between AR transformers and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the theoretical connection between autoregressive transformers and diffusion models, and leverage diffusion advantages to improve VAR's efficiency and performance.

Method: Reinterpret VAR as Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD) by showing mathematical equivalence when using Markovian attention masks, then import diffusion advantages like iterative refinement.

Result: The diffusion-based perspective of VAR leads to faster convergence, lower inference cost, improved zero-shot reconstruction, and consistent gains in efficiency and generation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a principled bridge between AR transformers and diffusion models, demonstrating that viewing VAR through a diffusion lens yields significant improvements in both efficiency and generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

### [156] [Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645)
*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN introduces hierarchical representation matching for CLIP-based class-incremental learning, using LLMs to generate discriminative textual descriptors that capture hierarchical visual concepts and match them to different semantic levels in CLIP's architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CIL approaches use simplistic templates like "a photo of a [CLASS]" that ignore the hierarchical nature of visual concepts and only use the last layer representation, missing hierarchical information from earlier layers.

Method: Leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors that augment semantic space with hierarchical cues, matches descriptors to different semantic hierarchy levels, and adaptively routes them based on task requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show the method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in class-incremental learning tasks.

Conclusion: HERMAN effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks by enabling precise discrimination through hierarchical representation matching while leveraging CLIP's full hierarchical information.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward is a benchmark for detecting AI-generated videos by identifying spatiotemporal fake traces. It includes 4.3K annotations across 3.3K videos with explanations, bounding boxes, and timestamps. A 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting deepfake traces in generated videos, focusing on human-perceived visual artifacts that reveal videos as machine-generated.

Method: Created DeeptraceReward benchmark with detailed annotations, trained multimodal language models as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations.

Result: The 7B reward model outperformed GPT-5 by 34.7% across tasks. Found consistent difficulty gradient: binary classification easiest, followed by explanations, spatial grounding, and temporal labeling hardest.

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed for socially aware and trustworthy video generation by focusing on human-perceived deepfake traces.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

### [158] [CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647)
*Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qidong Huang,Jiaqi Wang,Feng Wu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to image captioning, using a vision-free LLM to evaluate caption quality based on its ability to answer questions about the image, overcoming limitations of supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT-based captioning models rely on expensive human annotations, leading to memorization and limited generalization. The subjective nature of caption quality makes objective reward design challenging.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: LVLM generates captions, then a vision-free LLM answers multiple-choice questions using only the caption. Reward is based on answer accuracy, defining caption quality by its utility for downstream tasks.

Result: CapRL significantly improves performance across 12 benchmarks. CapRL-5M dataset pretraining yields substantial gains, achieving performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B with 8.4% average improvement over baseline in Prism Framework.

Conclusion: RLVR paradigm successfully addresses subjective captioning tasks. CapRL demonstrates that utility-based reward design enables more generalizable and diverse caption generation without expensive human annotations.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method that uses diffusion transformer features for referring segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring segmentation methods require fine-tuning or multiple pre-trained models with additional training and architectural modifications, while diffusion models contain rich semantic information that could be leveraged directly.

Method: Extracts attention scores from diffusion transformers, filters stop words that act as attention magnets, suppresses global attention sinks, and uses attention redistribution strategy with appended stop words to partition background activations into smaller clusters.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior methods across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Diffusion transformer features can be effectively exploited for referring segmentation through careful attention handling, achieving superior performance in a completely training-free manner.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.
