Project website:\n  https://matthew-leng.github.io/stocc", "summary": "3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous\ndriving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,\nit remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across\nmultiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and\ndynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ is a framework for 3D occupancy representation learning in autonomous driving, improving spatiotemporal feature learning and temporal consistency.", "motivation": "Efficiently aggregating 3D occupancy over time is challenging due to high processing costs and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.", "method": "ST-Occ uses a spatiotemporal memory for historical info and memory attention for current occupancy representation with uncertainty/dynamic awareness.", "result": "Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU and reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.", "conclusion": "ST-Occ effectively enhances spatiotemporal representation for 3D occupancy prediction."}}
