In\naddition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed\nto enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and\nredistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks\n(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise\nseparable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen\nconvolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that\nSAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\\% and 79.6\\% on the ImageNet-1K\nclassification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,\ndemonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAEViT is a lightweight Vision Transformer that uses sparse attention and convolutional blocks to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance on vision tasks.", "motivation": "Address Vision Transformer's limitations: large model size, high computational cost, and weak local feature modeling ability for real-world applications.", "method": "Introduces Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) for adaptive sparse sampling, Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) for inter-channel information exchange, and hierarchical pyramid structure with depth-wise separable convolutional blocks.", "result": "Achieves 76.3% and 79.6% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs respectively.", "conclusion": "SAEViT provides an efficient lightweight solution that balances computation efficiency and performance for various vision tasks."}}

While most existing detection methods\nprimarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake\ncontents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals\nin advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake\ndetection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more\nsensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations\nwithin texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized\nperturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in\nnon-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts\npreliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then\nintroduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture\nperturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the\npromising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and\nproducing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an\nefficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proactive Deepfake detection using texture-guided perturbations that invisibly insert signals in facial texture regions to distort Deepfake generation and create visible defects in manipulated content.", "motivation": "Existing Deepfake detection methods rely on passive analysis, but high-quality Deepfakes make this unreliable.
