### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR is a lightweight object detection model for real-time driver fatigue detection, featuring Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module and Rectangular Calibration Module to improve feature expressiveness and spatial localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue detection is crucial for road safety, but existing methods are either intrusive (physiological/vehicle-based) or have limitations in detecting small/occluded objects and multi-scale features (vision-based).

Method: Proposes YOLO11-CR with two key modules: CAFM (integrates CNN local features with Transformer global context) and RCM (captures horizontal/vertical contextual information for better spatial localization).

Result: Achieves 87.17% precision, 83.86% recall, 88.09% mAP@50, and 55.93% mAP@50-95 on DSM dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness.

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR provides a practical high-performance solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring with strong real-world deployment potential and future enhancement opportunities.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage-R1 is a vision-language model with reflective reasoning that achieves state-of-the-art performance for detecting AI-generated images in real-world scenarios, outperforming existing detectors by 5-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images pose significant threats to information security and public trust, but existing detectors fail to generalize from clean lab settings to noisy real-world scenarios with varied image quality and multiple generative models.

Method: Created Mirage benchmark from internet-sourced AIGI verified by experts and synthesized dataset from multiple expert generators. Developed Mirage-R1 with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, trained via supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning, and uses inference-time adaptive thinking for speed-performance balance.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mirage-R1 leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% on the Mirage benchmark and 10% on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses in-the-wild AIGI detection challenges through a comprehensive benchmark and reflective reasoning model that balances accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced framework that combines vision-language models with expert OCR tools to reduce hallucinations and improve document image parsing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from hallucinations and underperform compared to expert OCR models on domain-specific tasks, despite their end-to-end capabilities.

Method: A reasoning-and-tool interleaved framework where the model first uses its own OCR capabilities, then calls expert models for reference results, and finally rethinks the reasoning process to provide final recognition.

Result: Outperforms both non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models on ReST and OmniDocBench benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed reasoning-enhanced framework successfully mitigates hallucinations and improves OCR performance by leveraging expert models as references while maintaining the benefits of large vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

### [4] [Exploration of Deep Learning Based Recognition for Urdu Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13245)
*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a CNN-based Urdu OCR system using component classification and hierarchical neural networks, achieving 99% accuracy on ligature components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu's cursive script and complex structure make traditional segmentation-based recognition error-prone, requiring a component-based approach with automatic feature learning.

Method: Used convolutional neural networks trained on Urdu text dataset generated through character permutations, with connected component technique to extract ligatures only. Implemented hierarchical neural network with two levels for character permutations and component classification.

Result: Achieved 0.99% (99%) accuracy for component classification.

Conclusion: The component-based CNN approach with hierarchical architecture is effective for Urdu OCR, successfully handling the language's complex geometrical structure and context sensitivity.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE is a curriculum learning framework that improves ulcerative colitis severity classification by accounting for label noise and ordinal structure, using image quality as a proxy for annotation confidence and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) classification is challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore.

Method: Proposes CLoE framework that uses image quality (estimated via BBPS labels) as proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy to hard. Combines curriculum learning with ResizeMix augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves 82.5% accuracy and QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC dataset with ConvNeXt-Tiny, outperforming supervised and self-supervised baselines on both LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware training strategies like CLoE show strong potential for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter is a diffusion-based framework that generates realistic gait silhouette sequences, enabling controllable synthesis of diverse gait patterns while preserving privacy and improving gait recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition lacks large-scale labeled datasets and faces challenges in collecting diverse gait samples while preserving privacy. Existing methods rely on simulated environments or alternative generative models.

Method: Trains a video diffusion model from scratch exclusively on gait silhouette data, enabling generation of temporally consistent and identity-preserving sequences. Allows conditioning on covariates like clothing, carried objects, and view angle. Introduces identity embedding interpolation to generate novel synthetic identities.

Result: Synthetic samples improve gait recognition performance, especially under challenging conditions. Generated novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns useful for training while maintaining privacy of real subjects.

Conclusion: GaitCrafter represents an important advancement in using diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation, addressing key limitations in gait recognition datasets.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view vision-language models in autonomous driving that reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving face significant computational overhead from processing high-resolution multi-view images, which increases inference latency and memory consumption due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.

Method: Proposes Prune2Drive with two innovations: 1) diversity-aware token selection using farthest point sampling for semantic/spatial coverage, and 2) view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios per camera view based on task importance.

Result: Achieves 6.40× speedup in prefilling phase and consumes only 13.4% of original FLOPs when retaining 10% of visual tokens, with only 3% performance drop on DriveLM benchmark.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive provides an effective plug-and-play solution for reducing computational overhead in multi-view VLMs for autonomous driving without requiring model retraining or access to attention maps.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a differentiable meta-attack framework that combines existing Lp-based attacks to generate perceptually aligned adversarial examples with superior visual quality and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Lp-norm bounded adversarial examples often fail to align with human perception, and it's unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can improve perceptual efficacy.

Method: Multi-stage framework that aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned adaptive weights, guided by a meta-loss function that minimizes both misclassification loss and perceptual distortion.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks with 20.63% improvement in attack success rates and superior visual quality metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, FID improvements of ~11, 0.015, and 5.7 respectively).

Conclusion: DAASH provides a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense, demonstrating effective generalization to unseen defenses.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

### [9] [Automated Assessment of Aesthetic Outcomes in Facial Plastic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13363)
*Pegah Varghaei,Kiran Abraham-Aggarwal,Manoj T. Abraham,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision framework for quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using automated landmark detection, symmetry analysis, age estimation, and nasal morphology on paired pre/post-operative photos from 1,259 patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide objective, quantitative evaluation of facial plastic surgery outcomes through reproducible benchmarks and data-driven surgical planning tools.

Method: Leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis on a curated dataset of 7,160 paired pre/post-operative facial photographs from 1,259 patients.

Result: 96.2% of rhinoplasty patients showed improvement in at least one nasal measurement; significant improvements in alar width/face width ratio (77.0%), nose length/face height ratio (41.5%), and alar width/intercanthal ratio (39.3%). 71.3% showed enhancements in facial symmetry or perceived age. Patient identity consistency maintained with 99.5-99.6% True Match Rates.

Conclusion: The framework provides reproducible quantitative benchmarks for objective outcome evaluation, facilitating data-driven surgical planning and patient counseling across practices.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

*Yiting Wang,Ziwei Wang,Jiachen Zhong,Di Zhu,Weiyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Small language models with optimized prompts can achieve competitive accuracy in medical imaging classification, offering a practical alternative to large language models for healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face adoption barriers in healthcare due to high computational costs, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns, creating a need for more practical alternatives.

Method: Evaluated multiple small language models on NIH Chest X-ray dataset for classifying X-ray positions (AP vs. PA) using three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts.

Result: Certain small language models achieved competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, demonstrating that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering enables small language models to perform effectively in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users, making them viable alternatives to resource-intensive large models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in multiple-choice VQA benchmarks where VLMs can answer correctly using only vision and options without questions, due to visual relevance imbalance. The authors propose GroundAttack to generate hard negative options and create EOB-free datasets for more realistic VLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-choice VQA benchmarks contain a bias that allows vision-language models to select correct answers without understanding the questions, undermining the evaluation of true VQA capabilities.

Method: The authors conduct grounding experiments to identify the bias, then develop GroundAttack - a toolkit that automatically generates visually plausible hard negative options to eliminate the bias from datasets.

Result: When tested on EOB-free annotations created for NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, current VLMs drop to near-random accuracy under vision+options settings and show non-saturated performance under full question+vision+options settings.

Conclusion: The proposed GroundAttack successfully removes the EOB bias, providing more realistic benchmarks for evaluating VLMs' true question-answering abilities rather than shortcut learning.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

### [13] [Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439)
*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework using structured prompting with GPT-4o and o3-mini VLMs to train VISTA, a compact 3B-parameter model for highway scene understanding and traffic risk assessment that achieves strong performance while enabling edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for highway scene understanding and traffic risk inference struggle with scalability and generalization in complex real-world environments, creating a need for more robust and efficient solutions.

Method: Structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework using two large VLMs (GPT-4o and o3-mini) with Chain-of-Thought strategy to generate pseudo-annotations, then fine-tuning a smaller 3B-parameter student model called VISTA.

Result: VISTA achieves strong performance across captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) comparable to teacher models despite significantly reduced parameters, enabling low-resolution traffic video understanding and risk-aware caption generation.

Conclusion: Effective knowledge distillation with structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities, facilitating efficient deployment on edge devices for real-time risk monitoring without extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

### [14] [EDTalk++: Full Disentanglement for Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13442)
*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++ is a novel framework for controllable talking head generation that enables full disentanglement of facial motions (mouth, pose, eyes, expression) using orthogonal latent spaces and shared visual priors for both video and audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack proper disentanglement of facial features, failing to ensure independent operation without mutual interference and shared visual priors across different input modalities, limiting practical applications.

Method: Uses four lightweight modules to decompose facial dynamics into orthogonal latent spaces (mouth, pose, eye, expression) with learnable bases, enforces orthogonality for independence, employs efficient training strategy, and includes Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven synthesis.

Result: The framework achieves effective individual manipulation of facial motions and accommodates both video and audio inputs with shared visual priors.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ provides a comprehensive solution for fully disentangled facial motion control in talking head generation, addressing key limitations of existing methods and enabling diverse input modality support.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural

capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision

ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as

classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR proposes sharing intermediate layers across multiple images in Implicit Neural Representations to reduce parameter count by 60% while maintaining performance on image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Implicit Neural Representations use separate neural networks for each image, leading to computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multiple images.

Method: Share intermediate layers across multiple images while keeping input/output layers image-specific, and add a novel projection layer for each image to capture unique features. Analysis showed similar weight distributions in intermediate layers of trained INRs.

Result: Saves up to 60% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Scales effectively to handle 100 images with average PSNR of 34 dB. Proven robust across various backbones.

Conclusion: MINR provides an efficient parameter-sharing approach for multi-image encoding in implicit neural representations without sacrificing reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHQ is a distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that quantizes both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations, achieving significant hardware efficiency gains while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs require full-precision computation which causes significant hardware overhead. Previous quantization methods only focused on weights, offering limited savings due to lack of activation quantization.

Method: Uses Hadamard transformation to standardize diverse weight and activation distributions into a unified bell-shaped form before applying standard quantization, targeting both weights and activations.

Result: Reduces latency by 32.7%, energy consumption by 40.1%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3% compared to full-precision counterparts while outperforming previous quantization methods.

Conclusion: DHQ effectively addresses hardware inefficiency of INRs through comprehensive quantization of both weights and activations using distribution-aware transformation, demonstrating practical FPGA implementation benefits.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights

signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to short duration and low intensity of expressions. Current methods struggle with extracting fine-grained spatiotemporal features effectively.

Method: Proposes FAMNet - a fusion model with 2D CNN AMNet2D and 3D CNN AMNet3D using ResNet18 backbone and attention modules. Uses multi-task learning with MER and facial action unit detection, parameter hard sharing, and different data loading methods for 2D/3D networks.

Result: Achieves 83.75% UAR and 84.03% UF1 on SAMM, CASME II, MMEW datasets. On challenging CAS(ME)^3 dataset: 51% UAR and 43.42% UF1, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task learning approach with hierarchical attention and 2D-3D CNN fusion effectively extracts omni-directional features for micro-expression recognition, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing

Motivation: Current multi-view clustering methods focus on learning consistency and complementarity between views but overlook cluster-oriented representation learning, which is crucial for enhancing inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Multi-view instance learning with autoencoder reconstruction and contrastive learning, 2) Bi-level decoupling of features and clusters, 3) Consistency learning treating different views and neighbors as positive pairs for clustering assignment consistency.

Result: Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BDCL effectively explores multi-view data representations to enhance clustering performance by improving feature discriminability and cluster compactness through its novel bi-level decoupling and consistency learning approach.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDR methods overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO, and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes, leading to suboptimal image quality.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based approach that integrates motion blur and noise simulation into training, leveraging semantic information and exposure histograms to adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, finding better exposure schedules than traditional solutions within user-defined exposure time budgets.

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE effectively addresses the limitations of conventional HDR techniques by intelligently optimizing exposure parameters for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubles matches are more common in international tournaments but understudied due to data availability and multi-person tracking challenges, creating a research gap compared to singles analysis.

Method: Extracted keypoints from singles dataset using ViT-Pose, embedded through ST-GCN contrastive learning framework, incorporated custom multi-object tracking algorithm to resolve ID switching, and used Transformer-based classifier for shot recognition.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, successfully handling fast and overlapping player movements.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for doubles-specific datasets and analytics, broadening capabilities for understanding this predominant format of the fast racket sport.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

### [27] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ is a new image tokenizer that uses 2D Gaussians instead of traditional quantization to better capture geometric structures in images, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization-based tokenizers like VQ-GAN focus mainly on appearance features (texture, color) and neglect geometric structures due to their patch-based design, limiting their ability to model structured visual information.

Method: Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ) integrates 2D Gaussians into visual codebook quantization frameworks, encoding image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions that directly model structure-related parameters like position, rotation, and scale.

Result: VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with rFID score of 1.00 on ImageNet 256x256. By increasing 2D Gaussian density, it achieves state-of-the-art rFID of 0.556 and PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: VGQ provides a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness, demonstrating that incorporating explicit structural modeling through 2D Gaussians significantly improves image reconstruction fidelity compared to traditional quantization methods.

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by

*Yanbiao Ma,Wei Dai,Bowei Liu,Jiayi Chen,Wenke Huang,Guancheng Wan,Zhiwu Lu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometric shapes from foundation model features show remarkable transferability across domains. This geometric knowledge is used for distribution calibration in federated learning and long-tailed recognition to overcome data heterogeneity and sample imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between observed training samples and true distribution caused by sampling bias, noise, and data heterogeneity in deep learning.

Method: Leverage off-the-shelf vision foundation models (CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, then use geometric knowledge of feature distributions to calibrate distributions. In federated learning: acquire global geometric shape under privacy constraints to generate new samples. In long-tailed learning: transfer geometric knowledge from sample-rich to sample-scarce classes.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show effective overcoming of information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometric knowledge from foundation model features provides transferable distribution information that can effectively calibrate and improve learning in challenging settings like federated learning and long-tailed recognition.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Traditional deep learning models (EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-50) significantly outperform vision-language models (CLIP, Phi-3.5 Vision) on facial emotion recognition with low-resolution grayscale images, despite using a novel GFPGAN-based restoration pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare open-source vision-language models against traditional deep learning models for facial emotion recognition, particularly addressing the challenge of noisy, low-quality FER data that doesn't match VLM training assumptions.

Method: Empirical comparison using FER-2013 dataset (35,887 grayscale images, 7 emotion classes) with novel pipeline integrating GFPGAN-based image restoration and FER evaluation. Evaluated VLMs (Phi-3.5 Vision, CLIP) vs traditional models (VGG19, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0).

Result: Traditional models significantly outperformed VLMs: EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%), ResNet-50 (85.72%) vs CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%). Comprehensive computational cost analysis provided for all phases.

Conclusion: VLMs have limitations in low-quality visual tasks like FER. Need adaptation for noisy environments. Provides reproducible benchmark for future emotion recognition research.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAvatar: A 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction that improves expression modeling and texture continuity through sparse expression control and 3D priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity in highly deformable regions, limiting their effectiveness for head avatar reconstruction.

Method: Proposes expression-aware and deformation-aware framework with sparse expression control mechanism using key Gaussians to influence neighboring deformations, and leverages pretrained generative models for 3D priors to improve facial geometry.

Result: Experimental results show more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EAvatar successfully addresses limitations of current 3DGS-based approaches by combining sparse expression control with 3D priors, enabling better modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions for high-quality head avatar reconstruction.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

*Sukhun Ko,Dahyeon Kye,Kyle Min,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR introduces frequency- and locality-aware implicit neural representations with RC-GAUSS activation for explicit frequency selection and WEGE encoding using wavelet transforms to guide frequency information, outperforming existing INRs in 2D/3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural representations lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to spectral bias and difficulty capturing high-frequency details.

Method: Proposes FLAIR with two innovations: 1) RC-GAUSS activation for frequency selection and spatial localization under time-frequency uncertainty principle, 2) Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE) using discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and guide frequency information.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing implicit neural representations in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: FLAIR successfully addresses the limitations of traditional INRs by incorporating frequency awareness and spatial localization, enabling better capture of both low and high-frequency details in various vision applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeProphet enables software-only gaze prediction for VR foveated rendering without expensive eye tracking hardware, achieving 3.83° median angular error (24% improvement over baselines).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foveated rendering requires expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility issues.

Method: Combines Spherical Vision Transformer for 360-degree VR scene processing with LSTM-based temporal encoder for gaze sequence patterns, using multi-modal fusion to integrate spatial and temporal features with confidence estimates.

Result: Achieves 3.83° median angular error, outperforming saliency-based baselines by 24%, with reliable confidence calibration and consistent performance across spatial regions and scene types.

Conclusion: Software-only gaze prediction is viable for VR foveated rendering, making performance improvements accessible across VR platforms without additional hardware requirements.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

TL;DR: Lightweight GFVC framework with dual-mode optimization achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving while maintaining superior perceptual quality compared to VVC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFVC has superior rate-distortion performance but faces practical deployment challenges due to large model parameters and high computational costs, especially for resource-constrained environments like mobile edge devices.

Method: Dual-mode optimization combining architectural redesign (replacing 3x3 convolutions with slimmer layers) and operational refinement (two-stage adaptive channel pruning with soft pruning during training and hard pruning post-training).

Result: Achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving compared to baseline, while maintaining superior performance over VVC in perceptual-level quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight dual-mode optimization enables efficient GFVC deployment in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing complexity while preserving reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

*Hsieh Ching-Teng,Wang Yuan-Kai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuron-like encoding method with artificial photoreceptor layer that generates biologically-inspired spike data with color/luminance information, improving SNN performance while maintaining neuromorphic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag behind CNNs due to limited spike data information capacity. Current approaches using non-spiking inputs deviate from neuromorphic computing's spike-based processing principles.

Method: Proposed Neuron-like Encoding method that generates spike data based on biological neuron operations, enhanced with artificial photoreceptor layer to include color and luminance information.

Result: Experimental results using Integrate-and-Fire neuron model show increased information content in spike signals and improved SNN performance.

Conclusion: This biologically inspired approach effectively addresses SNN limitations while adhering to neuromorphic principles, showing strong potential for future neuromorphic computing development.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

### [35] [DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13560)
*Zhen Qu,Xian Tao,Xinyi Gong,ShiChen Qu,Xiaopei Zhang,Xingang Wang,Fei Shen,Zhengtao Zhang,Mukesh Prasad,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS is a novel framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation that uses self-supervised dictionary learning to detect anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for anomaly segmentation rely on prior knowledge of real anomaly samples and have limited cross-category generalization. The goal is to create a unified model that can detect anomalies in unseen classes without target data retraining.

Method: DictAS uses three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - simulates dictionary index/content using normal reference image features, (2) Dictionary Lookup - retrieves queried features via sparse lookup strategy (unretrievable features are anomalies), (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - enhances anomaly discrimination through Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

Conclusion: DictAS successfully transfers dictionary lookup capabilities to anomaly segmentation via self-supervised learning, enabling effective anomaly detection in unseen object categories without requiring retraining on target data.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify replaces SMPLify's iterative optimization with a neural network for 200x faster 3D human pose estimation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify's high computational cost limits practicality, while recent trends show neural networks can achieve similar accuracy with much faster runtime.

Method: Neural framework using single-pass regression instead of iterative fitting, with temporal sampling for data construction, human-centric normalization, and residual learning for generalization.

Result: Achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen datasets (3DPW, RICH), and works as model-agnostic plug-in tool.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline for efficient 3D human pose and shape estimation with significant speed improvements.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a generative attention-based model for video action analysis that learns feature semantics by leveraging foreground-background differences, addressing limitations in precision for IoT applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video action analysis methods overlook feature semantics and focus on action proposal optimization, making them unsuitable for high-performance IoT applications that require robust and scalable intelligent video analytics.

Method: A novel generative attention-based model that simultaneously learns frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics by leveraging differences between actions' foreground and background.

Result: Extensive experiments on action recognition and action detection benchmarks show superior performance, with comprehensive validation on widely recognized datasets demonstrating the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses feature semantics in video action analysis, making it suitable for high-performance IoT applications requiring precise and scalable intelligent video analytics.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

TL;DR: A new RVOS model that improves segmentation head design, integrates diffusion features without noise prediction, and adds a temporal refinement module to achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RVOS approaches focus too much on feature extraction and temporal modeling while neglecting segmentation head design, leaving room for improvement in boundary segmentation capability.

Method: Proposes Temporal-Conditional RVOS model that integrates existing segmentation methods, uses text-to-video diffusion for feature extraction (without noise prediction module), and adds Temporal Context Mask Refinement module to overcome VAE limitations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public RVOS benchmarks with improved segmentation quality and simplified model architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses segmentation head limitations in RVOS through innovative integration of diffusion features and temporal refinement, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Yoel Shapiro,Yahia Showgan,Koustav Mullick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid diffusion-GAN pipeline to generate synthetic adverse weather images from clear images for autonomous driving domain adaptation, achieving significant performance improvements in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems perform poorly in adverse weather conditions due to underrepresentation in datasets, and collecting/annotating real adverse weather data is prohibitively expensive.

Method: Develops multiple data-generation pipelines including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches. Extends existing DA GAN with auxiliary inputs, uses novel training recipe combining simulated and real images, and introduces adaptive blending to reduce hallucinations in Stable-Diffusion outputs.

Result: Achieves 1.85% overall improvement in semantic segmentation on ACDC dataset, with 4.62% improvement specifically on nighttime conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid diffusion-GAN method effectively synthesizes photorealistic adverse weather images and significantly enhances autonomous driving perception robustness under challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: Improving computational efficiency of State Space Models (SSMs) in computer vision while maintaining their unique sequential modeling capabilities, as existing token reduction methods don't adequately address SSMs' specific requirements.

Method: Proposes MaMe strategy that leverages state transition parameter Δ as an informativeness measure for tokens and introduces strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow during token merging.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency-performance trade-offs, maintains robustness under aggressive token reduction where other methods degrade significantly, and demonstrates strong generalization across image classification, video, and audio domains.

Conclusion: MaMe establishes an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in diverse SSM applications while preserving the sequential properties that make SSMs powerful for vision tasks.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

*Shiyuan Chen,Wei Sui,Bohao Zhang,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC is a novel camera-based 3D semantic scene completion framework that uses dual decoupling at source and pathway levels to separate semantic and geometric processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use coupled encoders that force trade-offs between semantic and geometric demands, limiting overall performance. The authors aim to address this conflict by decoupling these two aspects.

Method: Proposes dual decoupling: 1) source-level decoupling using a foundation encoder for semantic features and stereo cost volumes, 2) pathway-level decoupling with specialized branches. Uses hybrid view transformation and novel Axis-Aware Fusion module to merge features anisotropically.

Result: Achieves +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU improvements on SemanticKITTI, and state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360 with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU.

Conclusion: The dual-decoupling design effectively addresses the conflict between semantic and geometric demands, producing superior disentangled representations that lead to significant performance improvements in 3D semantic scene completion.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art talking head synthesis models fail to generalize across the full spectrum of human diversity due to limitations in existing training data's scale, quality, and diversity.

Method: Created TalkVid dataset with 1244 hours of video from 7729 unique speakers using a multi-stage automated pipeline that filters for motion stability, aesthetic quality, and facial detail, validated against human judgments. Also developed TalkVid-Bench evaluation set of 500 clips balanced across demographic and linguistic axes.

Result: Models trained on TalkVid outperform counterparts trained on previous datasets and show superior cross-dataset generalization. Analysis reveals performance disparities across subgroups that traditional aggregate metrics miss.

Conclusion: TalkVid addresses critical data limitations in talking head synthesis and provides a necessary benchmark for evaluating model performance across diverse demographic groups, enabling more equitable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGB-only category-level object pose estimation using transformer network with geometric feature prediction and RANSAC-PnP, achieving superior accuracy without depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in scenes lacking depth information by enabling accurate pose estimation using only RGB images in real-world scenarios.

Method: Transformer-based neural network for geometric feature prediction and fusion, enhanced by geometric feature-guided algorithm, with RANSAC-PnP for pose computation to handle variable object scales.

Result: Highly efficient and achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images only, eliminating need for depth data.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

*Ao Chen,Lihe Ding,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DiffIER to address training-inference gap in diffusion models that causes sensitivity to guidance weight, using iterative error minimization during inference to improve conditional generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) are highly sensitive to guidance weight selection due to a training-inference gap that undermines conditional generation performance.

Method: DiffIER - an optimization-based method that performs iterative error minimization at each inference step to reduce accumulated error and mitigate the training-inference gap.

Result: Outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks and achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces accumulated error, enhances generation quality, and demonstrates versatility across multiple domains with potential for broad applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

TL;DR: OmniTry is a unified virtual try-on framework that extends beyond clothes to any wearable objects like jewelry and accessories, using a two-stage training approach with mask-free localization and appearance consistency transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods focus mainly on clothes, but there's a need for a practical framework that can handle any wearable objects without requiring masks, with challenges in obtaining paired training data.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use large-scale unpaired images to train mask-free localization by repurposing inpainting models to automatically position objects, 2) Fine-tune with few paired images for object appearance consistency transfer.

Result: OmniTry outperforms existing methods on both object localization and ID-preservation across 12 classes of wearable objects, showing quick convergence even with limited paired samples.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends virtual try-on to diverse wearable objects with practical mask-free operation, demonstrating strong performance across comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: DeH4R is a hybrid model for road network extraction that combines graph-generating efficiency with graph-growing dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for road network extraction face challenges: segmentation-based approaches struggle with topology fidelity after vectorization, graph-growing methods are computationally expensive, and graph-generating methods limit dynamic vertex insertion.

Method: DeH4R decouples the task into four components: candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion, enabling dynamic vertex/edge insertions while maintaining fast inference.

Result: DeH4R outperforms prior SOTA method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale benchmark, while being approximately 10x faster.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining efficiency of graph-generation with dynamics of graph-growing, achieving superior topology fidelity and spatial consistency with significantly improved speed.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in multimodal models demands human-comparable performance across diverse environments, particularly in human-related visual contexts where existing benchmarks have overlooked essential skills.

Method: The authors created HumanPCR with over 6,000 human-verified multiple choice questions across 9 dimensions for Perception and Comprehension levels, plus a manually curated video reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences and proactive context extraction beyond question cues.

Result: Evaluation of over 30 state-of-the-art models shows significant challenges in human-centric visual understanding, especially in detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Models struggle with extracting proactive visual evidence and rely too heavily on query-guided retrieval.

Conclusion: Current multimodal models face substantial limitations in human-centric visual understanding. Advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and test-time thinking provide only limited benefits, indicating the need for improved evaluation methods and model development for human-centric applications.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Motivation: Acquiring high-quality annotated medical image data is costly and time-consuming. Semi-supervised approaches can reduce this burden by utilizing unlabeled data, and recent advances in state space models (Mamba) show promise for handling long-range dependencies in medical images.

Method: Proposes Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba (DCMamba) with three key components: 1) patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation leveraging Mamba's scanning characteristics, 2) diverse-scan collaboration module utilizing prediction discrepancies from different scanning directions, and 3) uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning to enhance feature representation diversity.

Result: DCMamba significantly outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, achieving a 6.69% improvement over the latest SSM-based method on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed DCMamba framework effectively leverages Mamba's capabilities and enhances diversity across multiple perspectives, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing educational content in Metaverse for agriculture/gardening learning is challenging due to difficulty in finding relevant scenarios and lack of sufficient datasets for training advanced models.

Method: Proposed hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve agricultural virtual museums using natural language queries, with a new dataset of 457 AgriMuseums.

Result: Achieved 62% R@1 and 78% MRR retrieval performance, with improvements of up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses agricultural Metaverse content retrieval and the new dataset enables better training of advanced models for educational content organization.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [53] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA is a novel targeted adversarial attack method that targets the intermediate projector module (Q-Former) in Vision-Language Models, enabling fine-grained manipulations while preserving unrelated visual content through Residual Query Alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods collapse rich visual semantics into single global vectors, limiting attack granularity and overlooking the critical projector module that bridges visual encoders with language models in VLMs.

Method: IPGA attacks the intermediate stage of the Q-Former projector module, operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than global representations. It uses Q-Former pretrained only on vision-language alignment without LLM fine-tuning, and incorporates Residual Query Alignment to preserve unrelated content.

Result: Extensive experiments show IPGA consistently outperforms existing methods in both global image captioning and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environments, and successfully transfers to commercial VLMs including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: Attacking the intermediate projector module enables more precise adversarial control and better transferability, addressing limitations of previous global vector-based approaches and providing more effective security testing for VLMs.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage in LVLMs by sequentially masking images with noise and aggregating logits to improve multi-image reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models show degraded performance on multi-image tasks due to visual cue entanglement across different images, a phenomenon called cross-image information leakage.

Method: Proposes FOCUS - sequentially masks all but one image with random noise during inference, aggregates logits across all target images, and contrastively refines using noise-only reference to suppress leakage.

Result: FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families without additional training or architectural changes.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning in LVLMs by effectively mitigating cross-image information leakage during inference.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

*Anas Gouda,Shrutarv Awasthi,Christian Blesing,Lokeshwaran Manohar,Frank Hoffmann,Alice Kirchheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D is a new dataset for 6D pose estimation specifically designed for mobile robotics in industrial environments, addressing limitations of existing household-focused datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose datasets focus on small household objects for robot arms, but mobile robots face different challenges like long-range perception, large objects, heavy occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives that aren't covered by current datasets.

Method: The authors created MR6D dataset with 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions, capturing mobile robotics challenges including distant viewpoints, varied configurations, large object sizes, and complex occlusion patterns.

Result: Initial experiments show current 6D pose estimation pipelines underperform in these mobile robotics settings, with 2D segmentation being an additional challenge.

Conclusion: MR6D provides a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods specifically tailored to mobile robotics demands in industrial environments.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [56] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multi-camera non-rigid 3D shape registration to 2D keypoints using generalized camera model with three approaches: known 3D point direction, unknown point with known orientation, and silhouette-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Shape-from-Template (SfT) from single images to multi-camera setups for improved accuracy in medical imaging and hand-held camera applications, leveraging mutual constraints between multiple views.

Method: Three approaches using generalized camera model: 1) keypoints on direction vectors from known 3D points, 2) from unknown 3D points with known orientation, 3) silhouette-based iterative refinement. Correspondence-based methods use convex programming.

Result: Demonstrated accurate performance on both synthetic and real data, showing improved reconstruction accuracy by utilizing multi-view constraints.

Conclusion: First comprehensive solution set for SfT with generalized cameras, enabling robust non-rigid 3D shape registration from multiple camera views with various constraint scenarios.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw is a bilevel optimization framework that uses LLMs as physics experts to generate interpretable constitutive laws from visual observations, with visual simulation guiding the evolution process for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring intrinsic dynamics from visual observations either rely on manually defined priors that don't generalize well to complex scenarios, or use neural networks that lack interpretability and have poor generalization.

Method: Bilevel optimization framework with LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution at upper level (LLMs act as physics experts to generate/revise laws), and vision-guided constitutive evaluation at lower level (visual simulation evaluates consistency with underlying dynamics).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively infers interpretable intrinsic dynamics, and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

Conclusion: VisionLaw successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining LLMs' knowledge with visual simulation to produce interpretable and generalizable intrinsic dynamics models from visual observations.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Conclusion: Med-CTX sets a new standard for trustworthy multimodal medical architecture by successfully integrating clinical reports with imaging data, providing both high segmentation accuracy and clinically meaningful explanations for breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA framework reduces attack latency in SNNs by 56-57% using timestep-level backpropagation and adversarial membrane potential reuse, maintaining comparable success rates to SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based attacks on SNNs suffer from high latency due to multi-timestep processing, making them impractical for real-time applications as they fail to exploit SNN-specific properties.

Method: Proposes Timestep-Compressed Attack (TCA) with two components: 1) Timestep-Level Backpropagation (TLBP) for per-timestep evaluation and early stopping, and 2) Adversarial Membrane Potential Reuse (A-MPR) to pre-calculate and reuse warm-up phase membrane potentials.

Result: TCA reduces attack latency by up to 56.6% in white-box and 57.1% in black-box settings compared to SOTA methods, while maintaining comparable attack success rates on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets.

Conclusion: TCA effectively addresses the latency limitations of existing SNN attacks by leveraging SNN-specific properties, enabling practical real-time adversarial attacks without compromising effectiveness.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban tree biodiversity is crucial for climate resilience and livability, but traditional field inventories are costly and supervised AI methods require labeled data that doesn't generalize well across regions.

Method: Unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without requiring labeled training data.

Result: Applied to eight North American cities, the method accurately recovered genus-level diversity patterns with low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices, while preserving spatial autocorrelation.

Conclusion: This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and supports continuous, low-cost monitoring for equitable greenery access and adaptive urban ecosystem management.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while

regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories

*Tong Xiang,Hongxia Zhao,Fenghua Zhu,Yuanyuan Chen,Yisheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA3 is a novel cross-domain object detection method that uses attention-based alignment and instance-to-image level adaptation to bridge domain gaps between source and target domains in intelligent transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain detection in intelligent transportation faces significant challenges due to domain shifts between different environments and conditions, requiring effective adaptation methods to maintain detection performance.

Method: Proposes Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3) with attention-based alignment module trained on both source and target domains, channel importance re-weighting, and instance-to-image level alignment specifically for target domain adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-domain object detection benchmarks show SA3 achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SA3 effectively addresses cross-domain detection challenges through its adaptive alignment mechanism and recognition strategy, demonstrating significant improvements in intelligent transportation detection tasks.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A novel training-free approach that learns high-success-rate distributions for text-to-image generation, ensuring faithful prompt alignment and mitigating common issues like missing elements and concept blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often fail to precisely align with text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts.

Method: Proposes a framework that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on target prompts, explicitly modeling the signal component during denoising to provide fine-grained control. The method is training-free, works with diffusion and flow matching architectures, and supports additional conditioning like bounding boxes for spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image generation fidelity and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a effective solution for improving text-to-image generation alignment without requiring additional training, making it compatible with existing architectures while providing enhanced control and spatial alignment capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments

TL;DR: AI multi-agent system for automated stone deterioration pattern identification that outperforms traditional expert-based methods


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stone deterioration identification methods are accurate but time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring expert teams for direct observation

Method: Developed a multi-agent AI system with five specialized agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, diagnostic coordinator) using cognitive architecture to simulate expert collaboration

Result: Tested on 28 difficult images with multiple deterioration patterns, the system showed significant improvement in all metrics compared to foundational models

Conclusion: The Id-Pattern system demonstrates that multi-agent AI can effectively automate stone pathology diagnosis, providing more efficient and scalable alternative to traditional expert-based approaches

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New realistic benchmarks for incremental object detection reveal that current IL methods underperform compared to simple replay strategies and individual training, highlighting significant gaps in adaptability and knowledge retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incremental learning evaluations use synthetic benchmarks that don't reflect real-world challenges, creating a need for more realistic benchmarks to properly assess IL performance.

Method: Introduced two realistic benchmarks: D-RICO (domain shifts with fixed classes) and EC-RICO (new domains and classes per step), built from 14 diverse datasets covering various real-world conditions.

Result: All IL methods performed poorly in both adaptability and retention; replaying small amounts of previous data outperformed all methods, but individual training remained superior.

Conclusion: The performance gap stems from weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to handle diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity, indicating fundamental limitations in current IL approaches.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg is a novel regularization method that uses Latent Concept Representations to guide medical imaging models toward clinically meaningful features instead of spurious correlations, improving robustness to distribution shifts without requiring dense concept supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on spurious correlations rather than clinically meaningful features, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts.

Method: Leverages Latent Concept Representations (LCRs) from a small auxiliary dataset to synthesize high-quality concept examples. Incorporates a regularization term that guides CNNs to activate within latent subspaces associated with relevant clinical concepts.

Result: Significantly improves robustness to injected spurious correlations in controlled experiments and enhances performance on diabetic retinopathy classification under both synthetic perturbations and out-of-distribution generalization. Outperforms baselines including multitask learning and concept-based models.

Conclusion: LCRReg provides a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for improving model robustness in medical imaging without requiring dense concept supervision, effectively addressing spurious correlation issues.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

*Taimur Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a ConvLSTM neural network model to forecast South Asian smog events using Sentinel-5P aerosol data, achieving good predictive performance for 5-day aerosol index forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: South Asian smog events cause severe air pollution with significant socio-economic impacts, but real-time forecasting systems for particulate matter concentrations are not established at regional scale.

Method: Used Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network that captures spatial and temporal correlations, using UV Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as predictor.

Result: The model forecasts Aerosol Index at five-day intervals with Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74.

Conclusion: The ConvLSTM approach is effective for smog forecasting but can be improved by integrating additional data and refining the architecture.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

TL;DR: Proposes SCRNet with Feature Aggregation Module and Spatial-Channel Regulation Module to address limitations of CNN and Transformer methods in medical ultrasound segmentation by combining long-range dependencies and local contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ultrasound segmentation is challenging. CNN methods ignore long-range dependencies while Transformers overlook local context. Need a solution that captures both global and local information effectively.

Method: Introduces Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) with Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to process dual input features. Integrates FAM within Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM) and incorporates into UNet encoder to create SCRNet framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in medical ultrasound segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SCRNet framework successfully addresses the limitations of both CNN and Transformer approaches by effectively combining convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global information, demonstrating superior segmentation performance.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis methods rely on pre-reconstructed 3DGS representations and face limitations with inflexible physical attributes or unstable optimization-heavy guidance from video models.

Method: Jointly optimizes Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction, refined with physically plausible reference videos using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to avoid complex SDS optimization. Uses a new dataset of 24,000+ 3D assets with physical annotations.

Result: Generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from single images in one minute, representing significant speedup over prior works while maintaining realistic rendering quality.

Conclusion: PhysGM overcomes limitations of existing methods by providing a feed-forward framework that efficiently combines 3D reconstruction with physical simulation, enabling fast and realistic 4D content generation from single images.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

*Ziang Wang,Xiaoqin Wang,Dingyi Wang,Qiang Li,Shushan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIME-Net is a unified dual-illumination enhancement framework that handles both low-light and backlit images using adaptive expert selection and damage restoration modules, achieving competitive performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single illumination degradation types and lack unified handling of diverse lighting conditions like low-light and backlit scenarios that commonly occur in real-world environments.

Method: Proposes a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator with sparse gating to adaptively select S-curve expert networks based on input illumination characteristics, integrated with Retinex theory. Includes a damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. Uses a hybrid MixBL dataset for training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without any retraining, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: DIME-Net shows potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex illumination conditions through its unified approach to illumination enhancement.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

*Andrea Atzori,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA is a novel face image quality assessment method that extends Vision Transformer backbones with a learnable quality token to predict face image utility scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and face recognition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FIQA methods primarily rely on CNNs, leaving the potential of Vision Transformer architectures underexplored for face image quality assessment tasks.

Method: Extends standard ViT backbones with a learnable quality token concatenated with image patch tokens, processed via global self-attention. Uses two output heads: one for face representation learning and another for quality score regression.

Result: Extensive experiments show ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks across both CNN- and ViT-based face recognition architectures.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures are highly effective for modeling face image utility, and ViTs represent a scalable foundation for future FIQA research.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

### [71] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle to accurately identify image rotations, particularly distinguishing between 90° and 270° rotations, revealing significant gaps in spatial reasoning compared to human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models' visual reasoning capabilities in detecting image orientation and spatial relationships across different rotations.

Method: Created RotBench - a 350-image benchmark with lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Tested state-of-the-art MLLMs including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro on identifying 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations. Used auxiliary information (captions, depth maps), chain-of-thought prompting, simultaneous multi-orientation presentation, voting setups, and fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Most models reliably identify 0° (right-side-up) images, some identify 180° (upside-down) images, but none can reliably distinguish between 90° and 270° rotations. Auxiliary information and prompting provided only small improvements. Fine-tuning improved 180° identification but not 90°/270° distinction.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in rotation identification, highlighting fundamental limitations in current multimodal models' visual reasoning abilities.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a new platform for advancing depth estimation research, providing utility for evaluating existing methods and highlighting areas needing improvement in challenging driving environments.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning strategy to determine appropriate annotation types (tags, points, scribbles, boxes, masks) for video action detection, reducing annotation costs with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations that are challenging and expensive to obtain, while real-world videos vary in difficulty and may not need the same level of annotation.

Method: Proposes an active learning strategy to estimate necessary annotation types per video, and introduces a spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach to generate pseudo-labels from different annotation types for effective training.

Result: Validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, the approach significantly reduces annotation costs while maintaining minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the annotation cost problem in video action detection by adaptively selecting appropriate annotation types and generating pseudo-labels through 3D-superpixel processing.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel perception system for autonomous highway driving that extends detection range to 250m using efficient sparse 3D encoding and self-supervised learning, achieving significant improvements in object detection and LiDAR forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need longer perception ranges (250m+) for safe highway driving at high speeds, especially for heavy trucks with high inertia. Existing BEV approaches have quadratic cost increases with distance.

Method: Built on sparse representation with efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, plus novel self-supervised pre-training scheme using unlabeled camera-LiDAR data.

Result: 26.6% improvement in mAP for object detection and 30.5% decrease in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting, reaching 250m perception range.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends perception distances to 250m while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling safer autonomous highway driving for both passenger vehicles and heavy trucks.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

TL;DR: Novel method for online 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB-only frames using adaptive view selection to improve scene completeness by integrating both keyframes and optimal non-keyframes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on keyframes which are insufficient for complete scene reconstruction, and online processing constraints prevent using many frames or extensive training iterations.

Method: Proposes adaptive view selection that analyzes reconstruction quality online to choose optimal non-keyframes for additional training, combined with an online multi-view stereo framework for 3D consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes with significantly enhanced completeness.

Conclusion: The adaptive view selection approach effectively addresses limitations of keyframe-only methods and online processing constraints, achieving high-quality 3DGS modeling from RGB-only input.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment is a data poisoning backdoor attack method for self-supervised contrastive learning that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images by manipulating random cropping mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art attack performance while maintaining clean-data accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data poisoning backdoor attacks for contrastive learning suffer from limited efficacy due to fragile implicit co-occurrence dependencies and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images.

Method: The method strategically manipulates contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism to implement noisy alignment, formulating this as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters.

Result: Noisy Alignment achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCL methods, maintains clean-data accuracy, and demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The proposed Noisy Alignment method provides an effective and simple approach for data poisoning backdoor attacks in contrastive learning by explicitly addressing noise component suppression through optimized cropping manipulation.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Motivation: Conventional video dubbing only edits mouth regions, causing discordant facial expressions and body gestures that break viewer immersion.

Method: InfiniteTalk - a streaming audio-driven generator for infinite-length dubbing using temporal context frames and optimized sampling strategy with fine-grained reference frame positioning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets with superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse-frame approach and InfiniteTalk architecture successfully overcome limitations of naive image-to-video models, enabling holistic audio-synchronized full-body motion editing.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Method: Models coarse-to-fine transformation through data-dependent flows in latent space with token matching strategy for spatial correspondence, preserving global structure while synthesizing local details.

Result: Effectively enhances shapes from various 3D generation approaches (single-view to sparse multi-view) with high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis and training efficiency.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D provides an efficient solution for adding geometric details to coarse 3D shapes without the computational overhead of large generative models.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires large numbers of Gaussians for high-fidelity rendering, leading to substantial memory consumption and storage requirements

Method: Proposes knowledge distillation with various teacher models (vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, dropout-regularized versions) and structural similarity loss to maintain geometric consistency

Result: Achieves promising rendering results in both quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS is a simple yet effective framework that addresses the memory/storage limitations of 3DGS while maintaining rendering fidelity

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage

Motivation: Standard retrieval frameworks struggle with fine-grained compositional queries and temporal variations in video understanding, limiting their ability to handle detailed modifications.

Method: Developed Dense-WebVid-CoVR dataset with 1.6M samples and dense modification text, plus a model using Cross-Attention fusion with grounded text encoder for precise alignment.

Result: Achieved 71.3% Recall@1 in visual+text setting, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.4% across all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively handle fine-grained compositional video retrieval through dense text modifications and cross-attention fusion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in

fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Motivation: Current methods for novel view synthesis from long videos suffer from pose drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations, especially when dealing with irregular camera motion and unknown camera poses in expansive scenes.

Method: LongSplat introduces three key components: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians, (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging learned 3D priors, and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: LongSplat provides a robust solution for novel view synthesis from long, casually captured videos, effectively addressing pose drift, memory limitations, and geometry initialization issues through its innovative joint optimization framework and spatial processing techniques.

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project
