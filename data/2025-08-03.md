### [2] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for fast reconstruction and real-time rendering of urban scenes, robust to appearance variations, with efficient training and high visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in urban-scale scene reconstruction, including appearance inconsistencies and computational efficiency.

Method: Scene partitioning for parallel training, visibility-based image selection, controllable LOD strategy, appearance transformation module, and enhancement modules like depth regularization.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in efficiency and quality, effectively reconstructing urban-scale scenes.

Conclusion: The framework is robust, efficient, and achieves high visual fidelity for urban-scale scene reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff combines diffusion models and Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic human gaze scanpaths, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for scanpath prediction often fail to capture the variability of human visual exploration, limiting their realism and applicability.

Method: ScanDiff leverages diffusion models and Vision Transformers to model scanpath variability and introduces textual conditioning for task-driven generation.

Result: ScanDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths.

Conclusion: ScanDiff advances gaze prediction by better capturing human visual behavior complexity, with potential applications in HCI, autonomous systems, and cognitive robotics.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) improves classification accuracy on low-quality echocardiograms, with SRResNet showing significant performance gains and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor-quality echocardiographic imaging in resource-constrained settings limits diagnostic model effectiveness, while SR techniques for echocardiography remain underexplored.

Method: Evaluated SR models (SRGAN and SRResNet) on the CAMUS dataset for tasks like 2CH vs. 4CH view and ED vs. ES phase classification.

Result: SRResNet notably enhanced image quality and improved classification accuracy, offering computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SR can recover diagnostic value in degraded echocardiograms, aiding AI-assisted care in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spike-based NeRF framework (PATA) is proposed to reduce computational costs while maintaining rendering quality by dynamically adjusting time steps during training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF models are computationally expensive, limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios. SNNs offer energy efficiency, making them a viable alternative.

Method: The PATA framework integrates SNNs with NeRF, using a dynamic time-step training strategy to balance rendering quality and computational efficiency.

Result: PATA reduces inference time steps by 64% and power consumption by 61.55% while preserving rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: PATA successfully addresses the computational inefficiency of NeRF models, making them more practical for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive is a vision-language architecture for autonomous vehicles, combining front-camera images, HD maps, LiDAR depth, and waypoints in a single branch. It uses cross-attention and a smoothness loss for real-time performance, improving success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need fast, accurate navigation in complex environments. Current methods often rely on recurrent memory, which can be inefficient. NovaDrive aims to simplify and improve performance.

Method: NovaDrive processes multiple inputs (images, HD maps, LiDAR, waypoints) in a single branch using a two-stage cross-attention block. It fine-tunes a vision-language backbone and employs a smoothness loss to avoid abrupt changes.

Result: NovaDrive achieves an 84% success rate (+4%), 0.66 SPL (+0.11), and reduces collisions to 1.2% (-1.4%) on benchmarks. Key contributors are waypoint tokens, partial fine-tuning, and cross-attention fusion.

Conclusion: NovaDrive enhances autonomous driving performance and efficiency, with potential applications in other embodied-AI domains. Its design reduces fuel/battery usage and simplifies updates.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MObI and AnydoorMed, two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical imaging, leveraging diffusion models for realistic and controllable inpainting across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and complexity of gathering real-world data for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging necessitate synthetic data methods with high realism and controllability.

Method: MObI uses a diffusion model for multimodal object inpainting, ensuring semantic consistency and coherence. AnydoorMed adapts this for medical imaging, focusing on anomaly inpainting with detail preservation.

Result: Both methods demonstrate successful adaptation of foundation models for reference-guided inpainting across diverse modalities, enabling realistic and controllable synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: The work shows that foundation models can be adapted for multimodal inpainting, advancing the development of systems for realistic and controllable synthetic scenarios.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive integrates vision, maps, and waypoints into a single model for autonomous driving, achieving high success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous cars require both geometric accuracy and semantic understanding, typically handled separately. XYZ-Drive unifies these for better performance.

Method: Uses a vision-language model with goal-centered cross-attention to fuse front-camera frames, overhead maps, and waypoints, processed by a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.

Result: Achieves 95% success and 0.80 SPL on MD-NEX benchmark, outperforming PhysNav-DG by 15% with fewer collisions and higher efficiency.

Conclusion: Early fusion of intent and map layout at the token level enables accurate, transparent, and real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-FineR, a training-free method for fine-grained image classification, leveraging LLMs and VLMs for open-set recognition without predefined labels, achieving SOTA results and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-grained classification methods are limited by fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, hindering scalability and adaptability to novel classes.

Method: Proposes E-FineR, a training-free framework combining LLMs and VLMs for open-set recognition, avoiding reliance on guessed class names and enhancing interpretability.

Result: E-FineR achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained recognition, excels in zero-shot and few-shot classification, and requires no human intervention.

Conclusion: E-FineR enables flexible, language-driven image classification, scalable for real-world applications, with potential in domains lacking expert annotations.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) combines complementary concepts into a two-stage framework, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OV-3DIS methods use vision-language models (VLMs) but lack integration of complementary concepts. This paper aims to unify and refine these concepts for better performance.

Method: The framework uses 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation and iterative merging/removal for proposal generation. Alpha-CLIP replaces CLIP for object-centric representation, and SMS score normalizes similarity to filter false positives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS, surpassing even closed-vocabulary methods in AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed unified and refined framework effectively addresses key challenges in OV-3DIS, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo is a zero-shot diffusion-based method for animating static portraits using facial movements from a driving video, addressing identity leakage and expression issues with a novel end-to-end framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches suffer from identity leakage and struggle with subtle/extreme expressions. X-NeMo aims to solve these by introducing a motion descriptor and cross-attention control.

Method: Uses a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor, trained end-to-end with a dual GAN decoder and augmentations, to control motion via cross-attention in diffusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing expressive animations with better identity resemblance.

Conclusion: X-NeMo effectively mitigates identity leakage and captures detailed facial motion, offering a robust solution for portrait animation.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural inverse rendering method jointly reconstructs geometry, reflectance, and lighting from multi-view images without light calibration or intermediate cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify multi-view photometric stereo by eliminating the need for light calibration or intermediate normal maps, enabling joint optimization of scene parameters.

Method: Uses neural implicit fields for geometry and reflectance, with shadow-aware volume rendering. A spatial network predicts signed distance and reflectance latent codes, while a reflectance network estimates reflectance values.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided methods in shape and lighting accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned images, and handles complex geometry and reflectance.

Conclusion: The method offers a unified, efficient approach for inverse rendering, improving accuracy and versatility.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

### [14] [Single Image Rain Streak Removal Using Harris Corner Loss and R-CBAM Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23185)
*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image restoration network with Corner Loss and R-CBAM Block improves rain streak removal while preserving details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image rain streak removal requires preserving structural details and visual quality, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Introduces Corner Loss to protect boundaries and textures, and R-CBAM Block to dynamically adjust feature importance in spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 33.29 dB on Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively removes rain streaks while maintaining image details and quality.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

### [15] [Multi-Modal Motion Retrieval by Learning a Fine-Grained Joint Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23188)
*Shiyao Yu,Zi-An Wang,Kangning Yin,Zheng Tian,Mingyuan Zhang,Weixin Si,Shihao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework aligns text, audio, video, and motion in a fine-grained joint embedding space for motion retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval methods lack intuitive interaction and sequential representation, limiting performance and user experience.

Method: Uses sequence-level contrastive learning to align four modalities (text, audio, video, motion) for better retrieval.

Result: Achieves 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion and 25.43% in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: Multi-modal motion retrieval, especially with audio, enhances performance and user immersion.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%

### [16] [A Novel Dataset for Flood Detection Robust to Seasonal Changes in Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23193)
*Youngsun Jang,Dongyoun Kim,Chulwoo Pack,Kwanghee Won*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset for segmenting flooded areas in satellite images is introduced, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks. The dataset includes 10 images per location from five Midwestern USA states, tested with state-of-the-art models, showing modest results and highlighting the need for future multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of suitable datasets for segmenting flooded areas in satellite imagery, aiming to fill this gap with a focused dataset.

Method: Collected satellite imagery from the 2019 Midwestern USA floods, processed uniformly, and evaluated using state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models and an ablation study on window sizes.

Result: Models showed modest performance, indicating the need for improved multimodal and temporal learning strategies.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly released to support future research, with findings suggesting the importance of advanced learning methods for better flood segmentation.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

### [17] [Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202)
*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) method to generate adversarial images for MLLMs, embedding target semantics in noise for robustness against defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deceive MLLMs with adversarial images while minimizing distortion and evading defenses.

Method: AGD introduces adversarial-guided noise in reverse diffusion, embedding adversarial signals across the full frequency spectrum.

Result: AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack efficacy and robustness to defenses.

Conclusion: AGD effectively generates adversarial images resilient to common defenses, advancing adversarial attack techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining supervised baseline and instance classification models improves agglomeration detection in food crystal images, enhancing classification accuracy and size distribution predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is challenging due to water transparency and limited perspective.

Method: Proposes a supervised baseline model for pseudo-labels, an instance classification model for segmentation, and a post-processing module to preserve crystal properties.

Result: Improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions, validated under two confidence levels.

Conclusion: The method effectively classifies potential agglomerated instances despite variability in manual annotation confidence.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

*Zicheng Lin,Weichao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO-ROC, a lightweight and high-precision model for road damage detection, addressing multi-scale feature extraction and computational efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with multi-scale feature extraction for diverse road damage (e.g., cracks, potholes) and high computational demands, limiting real-time deployment.

Method: Proposes YOLO-ROC with a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module for better feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves 67.6% mAP50, outperforming YOLOv8n by 2.11%, with a 16.8% improvement for small targets. Model size is 2.0 MB, and it generalizes well.

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time road damage detection.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks of task-detrimental AR content, such as obstruction or manipulation of user perception, ensuring AR safety and trustworthiness.

Method: Developed ViDDAR and VIM-Sense systems using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules to detect harmful AR content.

Result: Proposed three future directions: automated quality assessment, multimodal attack detection, and VLM adaptation for AR devices.

Conclusion: Aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned framework for AR safety, seeking feedback on perceptual modeling, multimodal content, and lightweight model adaptation.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

*Fan Lyu,Linglan Zhao,Chengyan Liu,Yinying Mei,Zhang Zhang,Jian Zhang,Fuyuan Hu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL), expanding unlabeled data to include base and novel classes, and proposes ALDC to address distribution bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL methods assume unlabeled data is only from novel classes, limiting practicality. GSemi-FSCIL better reflects real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) to dynamically correct feature distributions using base samples.

Result: ALDC outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL and ALDC address practical challenges in few-shot learning, improving performance and applicability.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Sungguk Cha,DongWook Kim,Taeseung Hahn,Mintae Kim,Youngsub Han,Byoung-Ki Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-QR is a reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting in RAG systems, improving retrieval performance without human-annotated data, though challenges remain with semantic retrievers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents in RAG systems is challenging, requiring a scalable, annotation-free solution.

Method: RL-QR uses reinforcement learning (GRPO) to train query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, synthesizing scenario-question pairs for training.

Result: RL-QR improves NDCG@3 by 11% for multi-modal and 9% for lexical retrievers, but struggles with semantic and hybrid retrievers.

Conclusion: RL-QR offers a scalable solution for RAG query optimization but needs refinement for semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents the first comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of cranial nerve (CN) pathways in the human brain, using multi-stage fiber clustering on data from 50 subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping CN pathways is challenging due to their unique anatomical structures and the complexity of the skull base. This work aims to provide a detailed and automated solution.

Method: Multi-stage fiber clustering is applied to ~1,000,000 streamlines from 50 HCP subjects, generating a CN atlas. The method is validated on multiple datasets, including clinical cases.

Result: The atlas successfully identifies 8 fiber bundles for 5 CN pairs, showing high spatial correspondence with expert annotations across datasets.

Conclusion: The CN atlas enhances automated mapping of CN pathways, improving analysis and visualization of complex brain structures.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like occlusions and appearance variations in object tracking by analyzing diverse tracking paradigms.

Method: Qualitative and quantitative comparison of core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach, with a novel categorization.

Result: Unified visual and tabular comparison of methods, organized perspectives, and summarized benchmarks.

Conclusion: Transformer-based tracking shows rapid advancements due to strong spatio-temporal modeling.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [25] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGSI, a new metric for evaluating time series forecasting by transforming data into images, and SATL, a loss function to enhance geometric structure modeling during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like MSE fail to capture the geometric structure of time series data, which is crucial for understanding temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes TGSI for evaluation and SATL, a multi-component loss function combining first-order difference, frequency domain, and perceptual feature losses.

Result: Models trained with SATL outperform baselines in both MSE and TGSI metrics without extra inference cost.

Conclusion: SATL effectively bridges the gap in evaluating and training for geometric structure in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

*Haoxian Ruan,Zhihua Xu,Zhijing Yang,Guang Ma,Jieming Xie,Changxiang Fan,Tianshui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATL, a method for multi-label image recognition with partial labels, improving pseudo-label accuracy by dynamically learning category-specific thresholds and using differential ranking loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for MLR-PL use fixed thresholds, ignoring varying score distributions across categories, leading to inaccurate pseudo-labels and poor performance.

Method: Proposes SATL, which calculates and updates score distributions and thresholds per category dynamically, and uses differential ranking loss to enhance threshold discrimination.

Result: Experiments on COCO and VG-200 show SATL significantly outperforms traditional methods in limited-label scenarios.

Conclusion: SATL effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-threshold approaches, improving performance in multi-label recognition with partial labels.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelNerd (Pixel Neural Field Diffusion) is a single-stage, end-to-end solution for image generation, avoiding the errors and artifacts of traditional two-stage methods like VAE. It achieves competitive results on ImageNet and text-to-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers rely on pre-trained VAEs, leading to accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. PixelNerd aims to simplify the process by directly modeling patch-wise decoding in pixel space.

Method: Proposes PixelNerd, a neural field-based approach for patch-wise decoding, eliminating the need for VAEs or complex cascade pipelines.

Result: Achieves 2.15 FID on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 FID on 512x512, with competitive scores on text-to-image benchmarks (0.73 on GenEval, 80.9 on DPG).

Conclusion: PixelNerd offers an efficient, single-stage alternative to traditional methods, demonstrating strong performance without complex pipelines or VAEs.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2 is adapted for low-cost 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI using minimal input, showing strong performance despite being a zero-shot model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of 3D breast MRI scans is labor-intensive and subjective, and commercial AI tools are costly and inaccessible in low-resource settings.

Method: SAM2 is adapted with a single bounding box annotation, propagated across the 3D volume using three slice-wise tracking strategies (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, center-outward).

Result: Center-outward propagation yields the most consistent and accurate segmentations, with SAM2 performing well despite no training on volumetric medical data.

Conclusion: General-purpose foundation models like SAM2 can enable affordable 3D medical image analysis in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM introduces an iterative refinement model for scalable and efficient 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, outperforming existing methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability issues in transformer-based 3D reconstruction methods, which suffer from high computational costs due to full attention across multiple input views.

Method: Proposes iLRM, which decouples scene representation, decomposes multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme, and injects high-resolution information at every layer.

Result: iLRM achieves superior reconstruction quality and speed on datasets like RE10K and DL3DV, with better scalability for larger input views.

Conclusion: iLRM is a scalable and efficient solution for high-quality 3D reconstruction, leveraging iterative refinement and optimized attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation, and editing with a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation, outperforming previous unified models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify reconstruction, generation, and editing in CLIP without degrading its comprehension performance, avoiding inconsistent results from additional decoders or quantization.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training scheme, self-distillation, and a dual-condition architecture connecting MLLM and diffusion transformer for joint conditions.

Result: Scores 0.87 (GenEval) and 0.53 (WISE) in text-to-image generation, and 3.62 (ImgEdit Benchmark) in editing, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: UniLIP expands CLIP's applications, maintaining comprehension while excelling in generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLiM, a novel framework for text-video retrieval, addresses candidate prior bias in MLLMs by leveraging bidirectional likelihood estimation and CPN, outperforming SOTA models by 6.4 R@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based retrieval methods introduce candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with higher priors over query relevance.

Method: Proposes BLiM, using bidirectional likelihood estimation (text-video and video-text generation) and CPN for score calibration.

Result: BLiM with CPN achieves 6.4 R@1 improvement over SOTA on four benchmarks, reducing bias and enhancing relevance.

Conclusion: BLiM and CPN effectively mitigate prior bias, improving retrieval and demonstrating broader applicability in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark for evaluating structural robustness in document layout predictions, addressing limitations of traditional metrics like IoU and mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics (IoU, mAP) fail to detect critical structural errors in document layout analysis, necessitating a more robust benchmark.

Method: Proposes LED, defining eight error types and three tasks: error existence detection, type classification, and element-wise classification. Uses LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset with injected structural errors.

Result: LED effectively differentiates structural understanding in models, revealing biases and trade-offs not captured by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LED provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating structural robustness in document layout analysis, addressing gaps left by conventional metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled pipeline for geometric image editing separates object transformation, inpainting, and refinement, using FreeFine for improved fidelity and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with large or complex transformations, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes a decoupled pipeline with FreeFine for inpainting and refinement, evaluated on the GeoBench benchmark.

Result: FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity and edit precision, especially for demanding transformations.

Conclusion: The decoupled pipeline with FreeFine offers superior performance in geometric image editing tasks.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a semi-supervised framework for camouflaged object detection that reduces reliance on labeled data by using self-training and hybrid prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSCOD methods suffer from prediction bias, error propagation, and high computational costs due to multi-network architectures. ST-SAM aims to address these issues with a simpler, more efficient approach.

Method: ST-SAM uses a self-training strategy to dynamically filter and expand high-confidence pseudo-labels, combined with hybrid prompts to leverage the Segment Anything Model for specialized tasks.

Result: ST-SAM outperforms existing SSCOD methods and matches fully supervised methods using only 1% labeled data, while training only a single network.

Conclusion: ST-SAM establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD, offering a simpler and more scalable solution.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

*Xuewei Tang,Mengmeng Yang,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Le Cui,Mingshang Luo,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Diange Yang,Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriorFusion, a framework integrating semantic, geometric, and generative priors to improve road perception in autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need reliable road perception in complex environments without HD maps, but current methods fail to fully exploit structured priors in road elements.

Method: PriorFusion uses an instance-aware attention mechanism, shape-prior features, and a diffusion-based framework with anchor points for accurate predictions.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements, especially in challenging conditions, with more regular and coherent predictions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively enhances road perception by leveraging structured priors, advancing autonomous driving technology.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how merging models affects knowledge retention and performance in continual learning, particularly focusing on shared vs. task-specific knowledge.

Method: Controlled computer vision experiments with visual cues, comparing merging of incrementally trained models vs. parallel-trained models.

Result: Merging preserves or enhances shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge; incremental training merging outperforms parallel training.

Conclusion: Linear merging in continual learning is effective for shared knowledge retention, with incremental training being superior to parallel training for model merging.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how text-to-image diffusion models internally represent content and style in artworks, revealing varying degrees of separation influenced by prompt tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diffusion models encode content and style concepts without explicit training on their distinction.

Method: Uses cross-attention heatmaps to attribute image pixels to content or style tokens in prompts.

Result: Content tokens affect object-related regions, while style tokens influence backgrounds and textures, showing emergent separation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how generative models represent artistic concepts without supervision, with code and tools shared.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of hyperparameter impact on lightweight models for real-time image classification, highlighting RepVGG-A2's balance of accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize hyperparameters for efficient deep learning models in resource-constrained applications like edge devices.

Method: Training seven models on ImageNet-1K with consistent settings, focusing on hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and data augmentation.

Result: Cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size improve accuracy and convergence. RepVGG-A2 achieves >80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference.

Conclusion: Practical guidance for building resource-efficient models for real-time image processing, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA is a reconstruction-based visual token pruning framework for autonomous driving, prioritizing foreground information to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual token pruning methods perform poorly in autonomous driving. Human drivers focus on foreground areas, so retaining such tokens is crucial for decision-making.

Method: Proposes FastDriveVLA with ReconPruner, a plug-and-play pruner using MAE-style pixel reconstruction and adversarial foreground-background reconstruction. Trained on nuScenes-FG dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA effectively reduces computational costs by focusing on foreground tokens, enhancing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

TL;DR: FASTopoWM is a novel framework for lane segment topology reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of existing methods by using fast-slow systems and latent world models for improved temporal perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lane topology reasoning methods lack effective temporal information use, are vulnerable to pose estimation failures, and have insufficient temporal propagation.

Method: Proposes FASTopoWM, a fast-slow framework with latent world models, enabling parallel supervision of queries and improved state representation propagation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OpenLane-V2, achieving 37.4% mAP for lane detection and 46.3% OLS for centerline perception.

Conclusion: FASTopoWM effectively enhances lane topology reasoning by leveraging temporal cues and mitigating pose estimation issues.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

*Yingkai Wang,Yaoyao Zhu,Xiuding Cai,Yuhao Xiao,Haotian Wu,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation improves robustness to domain shifts by using implicit feature perturbations and adaptive consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in medical images causes performance degradation in segmentation models due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols.

Method: The framework introduces learnable semantic direction selectors and covariance-based semantic intensity samplers to modulate domain-variant features while preserving anatomical consistency. An adaptive consistency constraint stabilizes feature selection.

Result: Outperforms existing domain generalization approaches on multi-center benchmarks, achieving robust segmentation across diverse clinical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shift challenges in medical image segmentation, enhancing generalizability and reliability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework for traffic sign recognition addresses long-tail distribution and small target challenges, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in traffic sign recognition: long-tail data distribution and small, multi-scale targets.

Method: Combines open-vocabulary detection (NanoVerse YOLO with RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv) and cross-modal learning (TSR-MCL).

Result: 78.4% mAP on TT100K dataset, 91.8% accuracy, and 88.9% recall, outperforming mainstream methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates data imbalance and enhances feature extraction, demonstrating superior performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road surface reconstruction is crucial for autonomous driving but current methods struggle with occlusions, visual clutter, and appearance changes due to lighting and weather.

Method: Integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels, planar-adapted Gaussian representation, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware color correction in HSV space.

Result: Produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, outperforming prior methods in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in road surface reconstruction, enhancing accuracy and robustness for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of input resolution on three deep learning-based face detectors (YOLOv11, YOLOv12, MTCNN) using the WIDER FACE dataset. YOLOv11 excels in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 has better recall, and MTCNN is slower but good for landmark localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery degrade face detection performance, necessitating a systematic evaluation of resolution's impact on deep learning models.

Method: Evaluated YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN across multiple resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640) using metrics like precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time on the WIDER FACE dataset.

Result: YOLOv11 outperforms in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 has better recall, and MTCNN is slower but effective for landmark localization.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for choosing resolution-aware face detection models based on operational needs, balancing accuracy, recall, and speed.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive studies on AGTH quality and distortions, and to improve evaluation standards.

Method: Created THQA-10K dataset with 10,457 AGTHs, conducted subjective ratings by volunteers, and proposed an objective assessment method using first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency.

digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

TL;DR: The report reviews six influential computer vision papers, covering ResNet, ViT, GANs, LDMs, DINO, and MAE, highlighting their innovations and impact on the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision, focusing on foundational architectures, generative models, and self-supervised learning techniques.

Method: Examines six influential papers, detailing their contributions: ResNet (residual connections), ViT (Transformer for images), GANs (adversarial training), LDMs (latent diffusion), DINO (self-distillation), and MAE (masked autoencoding).

Result: Identifies advancements like deeper networks (ResNet), attention-based models (ViT), high-fidelity synthesis (LDMs), and scalable pre-training (MAE).

Conclusion: The reviewed works represent milestones in computer vision, driving progress in recognition, generation, and unsupervised learning.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

### [47] [Short-LVLM: Compressing and Accelerating Large Vision-Language Models by Pruning Redundant Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23362)
*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs due to modality divergence, proposing a novel framework, Short-LVLM, to improve pruning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications of LVLMs are limited by high computational costs and large model parameters, prompting the need for efficient compression techniques.

Method: The authors identify challenges in pruning LVLMs, such as non-essential VL tokens and inter-layer feature gaps, and propose Short-LVLM to address these issues.

Result: Short-LVLM achieves a better performance-efficiency trade-off, is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Conclusion: The proposed Short-LVLM framework effectively improves layer pruning in LVLMs, offering a practical solution for reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

*Ali Youssef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMatcher is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for efficient semi-dense feature matching, combining Mamba's linear complexity with Transformer's attention for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature matching methods rely on Transformers, which are computationally expensive due to quadratic complexity. VMatcher aims to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: VMatcher integrates Mamba's Selective State-Space Model (SSM) with Transformer's attention mechanism, proposing hierarchical architectures for robust and efficient matching.

Result: VMatcher sets new benchmarks efficiently, ensuring robustness and practicality for real-time applications.

Conclusion: VMatcher offers a scalable and efficient solution for feature matching, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

### [49] [UniEmo: Unifying Emotional Understanding and Generation with Learnable Expert Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23372)
*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo is a unified framework integrating emotional understanding and generation, using hierarchical feature extraction and diffusion models, enhanced by feedback mechanisms and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional understanding and generation are complementary but often treated separately; UniEmo aims to unify them for mutual enhancement.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with expert queries, fuses features for diffusion-based generation, and introduces feedback mechanisms via joint training and data filtering.

Result: UniEmo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework with dual feedback processes enhances emotional understanding and generation, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

*Haoran Chen,Zexiao Wang,Haidong Cao,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MP^2A, a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled tasks, mitigating noise and improving domain-invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of noisy pseudo-labels and unstable alignment in multi-source domain adaptation with CLIP.

Method: Uses a progressive strategy: starts with high-confidence target samples, gradually includes harder ones to refine learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: MP^2A effectively mitigates confirmation bias and enhances domain-invariant feature learning in CLIP-based UDA.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRF-GS combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to overcome 3DGS limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address 3DGS limitations like sensitivity to initialization and weak inter-Gaussian correlations by integrating NeRF's continuous spatial representation.

Method: Jointly optimize NeRF and 3DGS by aligning spatial features and optimizing residual vectors for implicit features and Gaussian positions.

Result: NeRF-GS outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: NeRF and 3DGS are complementary, offering insights for hybrid 3D scene representation approaches.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

### [52] [AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402)
*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGA framework improves medical vision-language pretraining by capturing structured semantics and adaptive grouping, eliminating the need for hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods oversimplify clinical reports and rely on impractical hard negatives for contrastive learning.

Method: AGA uses bidirectional grouping with sparse similarity matrices, adaptive threshold gating, and instance-aware alignment loss.

Result: AGA achieves strong performance in image-text retrieval and classification, even in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: AGA effectively aligns medical images and reports without external negatives, enhancing fine-grained understanding.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

*Lemar Abdi,Francisco Caetano,Amaan Valiuddin,Christiaan Viviers,Hamdi Joudeh,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a reconstruction-free OOD detection method using Stein score-based denoising diffusion models (SBDDM) for efficient, accurate anomaly detection in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of current generative OOD detection methods, which are computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining for data changes.

Method: Leverages forward diffusion trajectories of SBDDM, capturing trajectory curvature via Stein scores for anomaly scoring with minimal steps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.43% and 18.10% improvement for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: SBDDM is a practical, efficient solution for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning system using hyperspectral imaging detects honey adulteration with sugar syrup, achieving 96.39% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated, non-chemical method for detecting honey adulteration, addressing the limitations of traditional chemical-based techniques.

Method: Uses LDA for feature extraction and KNN for classification in two subsystems: botanical origin identification and adulteration detection.

Result: Achieves 96.39% cross-validation accuracy in detecting adulteration.

Conclusion: The system is a viable alternative to chemical-based methods for honey adulteration detection.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances a dual-teacher self-supervised framework for art style classification by replacing MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving accuracy and modeling nonlinear feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art style classification is challenging due to limited labeled data and complex style-feature interactions. Existing methods struggle with global context and nonlinear relationships.

Method: The authors replace MLP projection and prediction heads in a dual-teacher framework with KANs, leveraging spline-based activations for precise nonlinear modeling.

Result: Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k show improved Top-1 accuracy and better linear probe performance compared to MLP-based methods.

Conclusion: KANs effectively disentangle complex style manifolds, enhancing classification accuracy and outperforming traditional MLP projections.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyCASS, a learning-based model for adjustable hyperspectral image (HSI) compression, addressing spectral and spatial redundancies. It outperforms existing methods and provides guidelines for balancing compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of hyperspectral data necessitates efficient storage, but the effects of spectral and spatial compression in learning-based HSI compression are underexplored.

Method: HyCASS uses six modules (spectral/spatial encoders/decoders, CR adapters) with convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture redundancies.

Result: HyCASS outperforms existing models on benchmark datasets and offers guidelines for balancing compression.

Conclusion: HyCASS effectively addresses adjustable HSI compression, providing insights for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage ML for accurate medical predictions without explicit programming, using chest X-ray images as a case study.

Method: Implemented baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 on 5824 chest X-ray images for binary classification. Used gradient-weighted class activation mapping for analysis.

Result: Both models performed well, but DenseNet-121 more accurately identified key regions in X-rays for decision-making.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 outperforms baseline CNN in focusing on essential image features for medical predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

*Taeheon Lim,Joohyung Lee,Kyungjae Lee,Jungchan Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF) to address resolution drift in non-classification tasks like human pose estimation, improving performance without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) has succeeded in classification tasks but struggles with non-classification tasks due to resolution variability (resolution drift), a new non-IID challenge.

Method: RAF uses heatmap-based knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from higher-resolution (teacher) to lower-resolution (student) outputs to enhance resolution robustness.

Result: RAF mitigates resolution drift, improves performance, and integrates seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. It also shows potential for other spatial-detail tasks.

Conclusion: RAF effectively addresses resolution drift in FL for non-classification tasks, with broader applicability beyond human pose estimation.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The CST Anti-UAV dataset addresses limitations in existing UAV tracking datasets by focusing on tiny UAVs in complex scenes, featuring 220 sequences with 240k annotations. Evaluation of 20 SOT methods shows poor performance (35.92% accuracy), highlighting the need for better benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking datasets lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces CST Anti-UAV, a thermal infrared dataset with 220 sequences and 240k annotations, emphasizing tiny UAVs and complex scenes. Evaluates 20 SOT methods.

Result: State-of-the-art methods achieve only 35.92% accuracy, significantly lower than on simpler datasets (67.69%).

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV highlights the need for improved benchmarks and methods in UAV tracking, fostering advancements in anti-UAV systems.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Result: Achieves 10% average improvement on 3D scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: 3D-R1 effectively enhances reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

*Julia Werner,Oliver Bause,Julius Oexle,Maxime Le Floch,Franz Brinkmann,Jochen Hampe,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task neural network for video capsule endoscopy combines self-localization and anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The short battery life of capsule endoscopy devices and data sparsity challenge AI integration. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and improve functionality.

Method: Developed a multi-task neural network for localization and anomaly detection, constrained by parameter limits for deployment in small capsules. Used the Galar dataset and Viterbi decoding.

Result: Achieved 93.63% accuracy in localization and 87.48% in anomaly detection with only 1 million parameters, outperforming single-task models.

Conclusion: The multi-task approach advances AI in capsule endoscopy, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Conclusion: FastPoint effectively accelerates point cloud processing without compromising performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable-Sim2Real introduces a two-stage depth diffusion model to improve 3D data simulation by learning an implicit mapping from synthetic to real data, enhancing performance in real-world 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between simulated and real-captured 3D data is challenging due to predefined physical priors failing to capture real-world complexity.

Method: A two-stage depth diffusion model: first stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion for residual generation; second stage refines using a 3D discriminator.

Result: Training with simulated data from this method improves real-world 3D task performance and achieves high similarity to real data.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real offers an effective data-driven solution for realistic 3D data simulation, validated by experiments.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-based pipeline using RGB-D sensing and deep learning for real-time mass estimation of strawberries, handling occlusions and pose variations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mass estimation of strawberries is difficult due to occlusions and pose variations, which traditional methods struggle with.

Method: Combines YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation, CycleGAN for occlusion recovery, tilt-angle correction, and polynomial regression for mass mapping.

Result: Achieved mean errors of 8.11% (isolated) and 10.47% (occluded). CycleGAN outperformed LaMa in occlusion recovery.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring, addressing occlusion challenges.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

*Timing Li,Bing Cao,Jiahe Feng,Haifang Cao,Qinghau Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hy-CycleAlign, a hyperbolic space-based method for cross-modal image registration, improving alignment and fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean space-based registration methods fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, leading to suboptimal fusion results.

Method: Hy-CycleAlign uses a dual-path cyclic registration framework in hyperbolic space, with a forward and backward network for closed-loop alignment. It includes the H²CA module for contrastive alignment.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in alignment and fusion for multi-modal images.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space enables more effective cross-modal registration, and Hy-CycleAlign sets a new benchmark for such tasks.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores how minimal sufficient pixel sets reveal differences in decision-making among image classification models, showing variations in concentration (size and position) across architectures and misclassified images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different vision models make decisions is limited despite their widespread use. The study aims to provide insights into model behavior by analyzing minimal sufficient pixel sets.

Method: The authors propose using minimal sufficient pixel sets to measure a model's 'concentration'—key pixels for classification. They compare these sets across architectures (e.g., ConvNext, EVA) in terms of position, overlap, and size.

Result: Different architectures exhibit statistically distinct concentration patterns. Misclassified images have larger pixel sets than correctly classified ones. ConvNext and EVA models show notable differences.

Conclusion: Minimal sufficient pixel sets offer valuable insights into model decision-making, revealing architectural differences and highlighting larger pixel sets in misclassifications.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

*Gopika Sudhakaran,Hikaru Shindo,Patrick Schramowski,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Kristian Kersting,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART introduces an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework for VRD using instruction tuning and adaptive sampling, improving generalization and handling novel relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRD models trained on limited data struggle with generalization and complex relations. Instruction tuning offers a more effective solution.

Method: Convert VRD datasets into instruction tuning format, use adaptive sampling to focus on informative relations, and fine-tune VLMs.

Result: ART outperforms baselines, handles unseen relations, and aids in segmenting complex scenes.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning and adaptive sampling enhance VRD performance, enabling generalization and practical applications.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require detecting objects in new environments and categories, which existing closed-set methods fail to address.

Method: Lifts open-set 2D detection to 3D using a 3D bounding box head, incorporates geometry prior, and uses canonical image space for cross-dataset training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Omni3D (closed-set) and open-set benchmarks (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet).

Conclusion: 3D-MOOD effectively generalizes to diverse scenes and novel categories, setting a new benchmark for open-set monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs) for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization, combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit feature field. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual localization accuracy while preserving privacy by leveraging 3DGS-based representations and robust feature learning.

Method: Proposes GSFFs, aligning 3D scale-aware feature fields and 2D encoders in a contrastive framework, and uses 3D structure-informed clustering for regularization and segmentation. Pose refinement aligns query features or segmentations with rendered GSFFs.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world datasets for both privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization.

Conclusion: GSFFs effectively combine explicit geometry and implicit features for accurate and privacy-aware visual localization.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: BeyondGloss is a gloss-free SLT framework using VideoLLMs for spatio-temporal reasoning, fine-grained hand motion descriptions, and contrastive alignment to improve sign language translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the modality gap between visual and linguistic information in SLT and capturing subtle hand variations.

Method: Leverages VideoLLMs, generates fine-grained hand motion descriptions, uses contrastive alignment, distills features from HaMeR, and applies contrastive loss to reduce modality gap.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss effectively bridges the modality gap and improves SLT performance.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: MamV2XCalib is a V2X-based method for automatic calibration of roadside cameras using vehicle-side LiDAR, eliminating manual intervention and reference objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual calibration is inefficient and disruptive, prompting the need for an automated solution leveraging V2X technology.

Method: Uses vehicle-side LiDAR and roadside images, combining multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume, with temporal modeling via Mamba to handle data defects.

Result: Outperforms previous LiDAR-camera methods in V2X scenarios, achieving stable calibration with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib is effective and robust for large-scale infrastructure camera calibration in V2X systems.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

TL;DR: MoGA reconstructs high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from single-view images using a generative avatar model and 2D diffusion models, ensuring 3D consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is inferring unseen appearance and geometric details from a single-view image while maintaining 3D consistency, as previous methods using 2D diffusion models produce inconsistent and unrealistic results.

Method: MoGA integrates a generative avatar model as a prior, projects input images into its latent space, and enforces 3D constraints. It formulates avatar creation as a model inversion process, refining pose and appearance.

Result: MoGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generalizes to real-world scenarios, and produces animatable avatars.

Conclusion: MoGA effectively combines generative priors and 2D diffusion models to achieve realistic and consistent 3D avatar reconstruction from single-view images.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

TL;DR: A directional pure 2D approach for 3D occupancy prediction balances accuracy and speed, achieving 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods prioritize accuracy over real-time needs in autonomous driving; this work aims to balance both.

Method: Slices 3D voxel features to retain vertical geometry and uses directional attention for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS on Occ3D-nuScenes, with 14.8 FPS on edge devices.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vcamba integrates spatial and frequency features for video camouflaged object detection (VCOD), outperforming existing methods with lower computation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited discriminability of spatial features in VCOD due to high foreground-background similarity, and the potential of frequency features and Mamba for motion perception.

Method: Proposes Vcamba with RFVSS for spatial features, AFE for frequency learning, SLMP and FLMP for motion perception, and SFMF for feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 6 metrics across 2 datasets with lower computation cost.

Conclusion: Vcamba effectively combines spatial and frequency features for efficient and accurate VCOD.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The MIDI-B Challenge standardized benchmarking of DICOM image de-identification tools, achieving high accuracy (97.91%-99.93%) using diverse methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure compliance with privacy laws while preserving non-PHI metadata for AI research in medical imaging.

Method: A three-phase challenge (training, validation, test) with synthetic PHI/PII in DICOM images, evaluated using rule-based scoring.

Result: Ten teams completed the challenge, with scores ranging from 97.91% to 99.93%.

Conclusion: The challenge successfully demonstrated the feasibility of rule-based de-identification while preserving research-critical metadata.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

### [77] [DivControl: Knowledge Diversion for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23620)
*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl introduces a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable image generation, improving generalization and reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation either require separate models for each condition or use entangled representations, leading to poor generalization and high adaptation costs.

Method: DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into disentangled components (learngenes and tailors) and uses a dynamic gate for knowledge diversion, enabling efficient adaptation. A representation alignment loss enhances condition fidelity.

Result: DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4× less training cost, improves performance on basic conditions, and shows strong zero-shot/few-shot performance on unseen conditions.

Conclusion: DivControl offers superior scalability, modularity, and transferability for controllable image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

TL;DR: EMAT improves few-shot classification and segmentation, especially for small objects, with memory-efficient attention and fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA struggles with small objects in FS-CS tasks, and evaluation settings waste costly annotations.

Method: EMAT introduces memory-efficient masked attention, learnable downscaling, and parameter-efficiency enhancements.

Result: EMAT outperforms SOTA on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ with fewer parameters and better small-object accuracy.

Conclusion: EMAT advances FS-CS performance and introduces practical evaluation settings to utilize costly annotations.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Forward-Forward (FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is proposed, eliminating gradient approximation and reducing computational complexity. It includes a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism and achieves high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SNNs is challenging due to non-differentiability and high computational demands of backpropagation. Existing gradient approximation methods sacrifice accuracy and are inefficient for edge devices.

Method: The proposed framework treats spiking activations as black-box modules, avoiding gradient approximation. It also introduces a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism to optimize resource allocation.

Result: Achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and 75.64% on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, outperforming existing FF-based SNN methods. Reduces memory access and computational power consumption.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient, gradient approximation-free solution for training SNNs, with superior performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

*Kunpeng Qiu,Zhiying Zhou,Yongxin Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called Adaptively Distilled ControlNet improves medical image segmentation by using dual-model distillation for privacy-preserving and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation is limited by privacy issues and labor-intensive labeling, hindering segmentation model performance.

Method: The framework uses a teacher model (conditioned on mask-image pairs) to regularize a mask-only student model via noise alignment and adaptive regularization. Only the student is used during sampling for privacy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, and SANet gains 2.6%/3.5% on Polyps.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, superior, and privacy-preserving for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

*Yang Gao,Po-Chien Luan,Kaouther Messaoud,Lan Feng,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses zero-shot transfer challenges in human trajectory prediction by proposing OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model with explicit temporal metadata conditioning, achieving superior performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained models struggle with zero-shot transfer to datasets with varying temporal dynamics, requiring fine-tuning and limiting scalability.

Method: The authors isolate temporal generalization issues and introduce OmniTraj, a model explicitly conditioned on frame rate, pre-trained on a heterogeneous dataset.

Result: OmniTraj reduces prediction error by over 70% in zero-shot transfer and achieves state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning on four datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal metadata conditioning is highly effective for zero-shot transfer, making OmniTraj a scalable and practical solution.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Conclusion: SAMSA provides a flexible, efficient framework for hyperspectral medical image analysis, integrating diverse spectral datasets seamlessly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal
training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with
different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

*Jialei Chen,Wuhao Xu,Sipeng He,Baoru Huang,Dongchun Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2V-GS introduces a method to synthesize autonomous driving data from infrastructure views using Gaussian Splatting, outperforming existing methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving data collection is costly and inefficient; synthesizing data from real-world images offers a scalable solution.

Method: Uses adaptive depth warp for dense training views, cascade inpainting for view expansion, and cross-view confidence-guided optimization.

Result: Significantly improves synthesis quality, outperforming StreetGaussian by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9% in key metrics.

Conclusion: I2V-GS is a pioneering framework for infrastructure-vehicle view transformation, enhancing autonomous driving dataset generation.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Motivation: Addressing the challenges of All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) by leveraging the generative power of diffusion models for diverse degradations.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating low-quality visual priors into LDMs, with DAFF for adaptive degradation handling and DAEM to mitigate detail loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-task and mixed degradation settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration, with code to be released.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code

*Zhenyang Li,Xiaoyang Bai,Tongchen Zhang,Pengfei Shen,Weiwei Xu,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR improves 3D video reconstruction for VR/AR by using a velocity field modeling scheme, addressing overfitting and dynamic content issues with optical flow-based optimization and adaptive densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is crucial for realistic VR/AR experiences, but existing methods struggle with complex motion and scale variations, leading to overfitting and poor visual quality.

Method: Proposes FlowGaussian-VR, featuring a velocity field rendering pipeline for optical flow-based optimization and a flow-assisted adaptive densification strategy to adjust Gaussians in dynamic regions.

Result: Achieves notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB PSNR gain), reduces blurry artifacts, and regularizes Gaussian trajectories in challenging motion scenarios.

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR effectively addresses limitations in dynamic scene reconstruction, offering superior visual quality and trackable motion for VR/AR applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve explainability in image classification by incorporating risk estimation into pixel attribution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overconfidence in deep learning models' predictions and pixel attribution, enhancing decision-making in tumor resections.

Method: Iteratively applies a classification model with pixel attribution to create a volume of PA maps, generating pixel-wise distributions and estimating expectation values and risk via coefficient of variation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pCLE data and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances explainability and provides risk estimation, improving reliability in clinical decision-making.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Angela Dai,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven method to replace axiomatic regularization and training in deep functional maps, using score-based generative modeling for improved accuracy and generality in non-rigid shape matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on axiomatic models for regularization and training, limiting accuracy and applicability. The authors aim to replace these with data-driven approaches.

Method: Train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, then apply it to promote structural properties of ground truth maps.

Result: The learned models are category-agnostic and outperform axiomatic approaches in zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Conclusion: Data-driven regularization and training can fully replace axiomatic methods, leading to better performance in shape correspondence tasks.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGNet, a large-scale affordance segmentation benchmark, and AffordanceNet, a framework for open-world robotic grasping, addressing the lack of reasoning-based data in current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic grasping systems lack reasoning-based large-scale affordance data, limiting their effectiveness in open-world scenarios.

Method: The authors build RAGNet, a benchmark with 273k images and 26k reasoning instructions, and propose AffordanceNet, combining a VLM pre-trained on affordance data and a grasping network.

Result: AffordanceNet demonstrates strong open-world generalization in affordance segmentation and real-robot tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for open-world robotic grasping with human-like reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIAS improves Slot Attention by re-initializing redundant slots and using self-distillation for better object representation in Object-Centric Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of redundant slots and lack of internal supervision in Slot Attention, leading to erroneous object segmentation.

Method: Introduces re-initialization of slots and self-distillation by aligning early and late attention maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in object discovery, recognition, and advanced visual tasks.

Conclusion: DIAS enhances Slot Attention's efficiency and accuracy, offering a robust solution for OCL tasks.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

*Di Li,Jie Feng,Jiahao Chen,Weisheng Dong,Guanbin Li,Yuhui Zheng,Mingtao Feng,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeqAffordSplat, a benchmark for sequential 3D affordance reasoning, and SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework leveraging LLMs and geometric pre-training to handle complex multi-object tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D affordance reasoning methods are limited to single-object, single-step interactions, failing to address real-world multi-object, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposes SeqSplatNet, which uses a large language model to autoregressively generate text with segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder for 3D mask production. Includes geometric pre-training and 2D semantic feature fusion.

Result: SeqSplatNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark, advancing affordance reasoning to sequential tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in 3D affordance reasoning, enabling complex sequential tasks in 3DGS environments.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

*Li Siyao,Yao Feng,Omid Tehari,Chen Change Loy,Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 'half-physics' method enhances SMPL-X models for realistic physical interactions without requiring learning, ensuring real-time performance and motion fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human models like SMPL-X lack physical interaction capabilities, leading to issues like interpenetration and unrealistic dynamics.

Method: Proposes a 'half-physics' mechanism to convert kinematic motion into physics simulation, maintaining kinematic control while enabling plausible interactions.

Result: Eliminates penetration and unrealistic dynamics, operates in real time, and generalizes to any body shape/motion without training.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between kinematic and physics-based models, offering a practical solution for realistic human-environment interactions.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phi-Ground, a model family for GUI grounding in Computer Use Agents (CUAs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding models for CUAs are inaccurate (<65% accuracy), hindering deployment. The study aims to improve grounding models for reliable agent actions.

Method: An empirical study on grounding model training, covering data collection to model training, leading to the development of Phi-Ground.

Result: Phi-Ground achieves SOTA performance on five benchmarks for models under 10B parameters, with scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision.

Conclusion: The study clarifies grounding model construction and benefits perception tasks, with Phi-Ground demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

*Zihan Wang,Jeff Tan,Tarasha Khurana,Neehar Peri,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos, overcoming limitations of dense multi-view setups by aligning monocular reconstructions for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require expensive dense multi-view setups, which are impractical for diverse real-world scenes. The goal is to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors from sparse-view cameras.

Method: The approach aligns independent monocular reconstructions from each camera to ensure time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions.

Result: The method outperforms prior art, especially in novel view rendering, as demonstrated on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges, offering a practical alternative to dense multi-view setups.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

TL;DR: CBMs struggle with concept reliability under distribution shifts. SUB, a new benchmark, is introduced to evaluate CBMs using synthetic images and a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of CBMs in identifying correct concepts under distribution shifts, ensuring transparency in AI applications like medicine.

Method: Introduces SUB, a benchmark with 38,400 synthetic images based on CUB, using Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) for precise image control.

Result: SUB enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs, highlighting their limitations and aiding in developing more robust interpretable models.

Conclusion: The SUB benchmark and TDG method contribute to improving the robustness and reliability of concept-based interpretable models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for video-to-4D generation using a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE and Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model, achieving high-quality dynamic 3D content from single videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 4D diffusion modeling due to costly data construction and high-dimensional representation of 3D shape, appearance, and motion.

Method: Introduces a VAE to encode Gaussian Splats and their variations, compressing animations into a latent space, and trains a diffusion model conditioned on input videos.

Result: Superior generation quality and generalization to in-the-wild videos, despite training on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Paves the way for high-quality animated 3D content generation from videos.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI dataset for pancreas segmentation, addressing cross-center and cross-sequence domain shifts, and proposes a semi-supervised method outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook variability in MR sequences, and pancreas segmentation is challenging due to low contrast and under-representation in datasets, despite its clinical importance.

Method: The dataset includes 563 MRI scans from six institutions, with pixel-accurate masks. A semi-supervised approach leverages anatomical invariances for domain generalization.

Result: The proposed method achieves 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on test centers, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging, highlighting the need for specialized solutions for cross-sequence shifts.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

TL;DR: A framework for aligning and harmonizing 30m HLS imagery using 10m HLS as reference, improving super-resolution for heterogeneous satellite sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data fusion due to differing resolutions and characteristics of satellite sensors.

Method: Develop a preliminary framework to align and harmonize HLS 30m imagery with HLS 10m as reference.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improved super-resolution for Landsat imagery.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates feasibility for heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution, with insights for future advancements.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
