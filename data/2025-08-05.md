### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage is a novel method for verifying dataset ownership in image recognition models by embedding imperceptible traces in hard samples, balancing verification effectiveness and data integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about unauthorized use of proprietary image data in AI models necessitate reliable ownership verification methods without compromising data integrity.

Method: HoneyImage selectively modifies hard samples to embed verifiable traces, ensuring minimal impact on dataset integrity and downstream performance.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show HoneyImage achieves strong verification accuracy with imperceptible traces and minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: HoneyImage offers a practical solution for protecting dataset ownership, promoting safe data sharing for AI advancements.

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated phase masks for rare or complex morphologies in metal alloys limits machine learning effectiveness in microstructure segmentation.

Method: PF-DiffSeg uses phase-fraction controlled diffusion to generate microstructure images and masks in a single trajectory, emphasizing minority classes.

Result: The method outperforms standard augmentation and two-stage baselines, improving segmentation accuracy and reducing inference time.

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg offers a scalable, unified solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates hybrid deep learning models combining autoencoders with RNNs and 3D CNNs for video frame prediction, showing improved performance, especially with 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs on grayscale real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video frame prediction has critical applications (e.g., weather forecasting, autonomous systems) but current models need improvement.

Method: Hybrid deep learning approaches combining autoencoders with RNNs, 3D CNNs, and ConvLSTMs were tested on diverse datasets.

Result: SSIM metrics improved from 0.69 to 0.82, with 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs performing best on grayscale real-world videos.

Conclusion: Hybrid models, especially those using 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs, are effective for video frame prediction, with real-world grayscale data being the easiest to predict.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC is a self-supervised pre-training framework for event-based perception, leveraging long-term temporal information in recurrent models, outperforming feedforward models in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for event-based pre-training ignore temporal information, limiting performance. TESPEC addresses this gap by focusing on long-term spatio-temporal learning.

Method: TESPEC uses masked image modeling with a novel reconstruction target, accumulating events into pseudo grayscale videos to capture high-level semantics robustly.

Result: TESPEC achieves state-of-the-art results in object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: TESPEC demonstrates the importance of long-term temporal information in event-based perception, enabling recurrent models to outperform feedforward ones when pre-trained properly.

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing

improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCRA improves VLMs by coordinating attention mechanisms for better cross-modal alignment, achieving SOTA performance with minimal added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with mismatched attention and suboptimal performance due to uncoordinated cross-modal embedding learning.

Method: Proposes CCRA with LPWCA for fine-grained regional-semantic correlations and PAI to systematically coordinate attention mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms baselines on ten benchmarks, achieving SOTA with only 3.55M extra parameters and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: CCRA effectively aligns attention mechanisms, enhancing performance and interpretability in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt a labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling, enhancing deep neural network performance for new use cases.

Method: Transfer stereo- and multimodal-based labeling, train semantic segmentation with auto-labels, and fine-tune with manual annotations.

Result: Fine-tuning with minimal manual data improves network performance. Combining auto-labels with manual data speeds adaptation to new scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining auto-labels and small manual datasets efficiently adapts deep neural networks to new applications like treadmill-to-bicycle transitions.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

### [10] [ROVI: A VLM-LLM Re-Captioned Dataset for Open-Vocabulary Instance-Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01008)
*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI is a synthetic dataset for text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M web images using a re-captioning strategy with VLM and LLM, outperforming existing datasets in quality and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve instance-grounded text-to-image generation by creating a high-quality dataset with comprehensive visual descriptions and open-vocabulary categories.

Method: Uses re-captioning: VLM generates visual descriptions, processed by LLM for OVDs to detect categories, linking global prompts to instance annotations.

Result: ROVI surpasses existing datasets in quality, resolution, and category diversity. GLIGEN trained on ROVI outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: ROVI advances text-to-image generation with superior dataset quality and open-vocabulary capabilities, demonstrated by GLIGEN's performance.

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT uses eye-tracking data to classify human expertise in visual tasks, achieving viable performance with small evaluation windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the assessment of human expertise in visual tasks using eye-tracking features, enabling dynamic human-AI pairing.

Method: AutoSIGHT employs an ensemble of eye-tracking features to classify experts and non-experts, tested on iris PAD tasks.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.751 (5s window) and 0.8306 (30s window), showing effective expertise detection.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of automated expertise assessment, with potential for dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured images is crucial for robotics, mapping, and scene understanding, but global SfM methods struggle with noise or missing data.

Method: The paper details an incremental SfM pipeline, emphasizing geometric consistency and iterative refinement via bundle adjustment.

Result: The approach is validated on a real dataset, showing reliable reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence.

Conclusion: Incremental SfM is a practical and reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

### [13] [Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Anomaly Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01045)
*Theo Di Piazza,Carole Lazarus,Olivier Nempont,Loic Boussel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-based method for multi-label classification of 3D CT scans, addressing limitations of 3D CNNs and Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated methods are needed to assist radiologists with increasing CT scan workloads, but existing approaches struggle with long-range dependencies or high computational costs.

Method: Models CT scans as structured graphs using axial slice triplets nodes and spectral domain convolution for anomaly classification.

Result: Demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, competitive performance, and robustness to z-axis translation.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach is a viable alternative to existing methods, offering improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

### [14] [Evading Data Provenance in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01074)
*Hongyu Zhu,Sichu Liang,Wenwen Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Fangqi Li,Shi-Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified evasion framework to bypass Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) methods, outperforming existing attacks by leveraging Vision-Language and Large Language Models for selective knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DOV methods rely on oversimplistic evasion attacks, creating a false sense of security. This paper aims to expose vulnerabilities in DOV by proposing a more sophisticated evasion approach.

Method: A teacher model learns from a copyright dataset, then transfers task-relevant but identifier-independent knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution dataset. Vision-Language and Large Language Models curate informative subsets for effective transfer.

Result: The framework eliminates copyright identifiers and outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead.

Conclusion: The study reveals key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, emphasizing the need for long-term improvements to enhance their practicality.

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation by evaluating 3D reconstruction models.

Method: Benchmarked Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D on custom datasets using 2D perceptual and 3D geometric metrics.

Result: Models perform better on spacecraft for image quality and on asteroids for shape accuracy; Hunyuan-3D excels in both domains.

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0 advances 3D reconstruction benchmarks, highlighting domain-specific strengths of models.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

### [16] [COSTARR: Consolidated Open Set Technique with Attenuation for Robust Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01087)
*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR improves open-set recognition by leveraging attenuation hypothesis and combining familiar and unfamiliar features, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling novelty in visual recognition is challenging; existing methods rely on familiarity hypothesis, missing key attenuation information.

Method: Proposes COSTARR, combining familiar features and attenuation hypothesis, with probabilistic interpretation and ablation studies.

Result: COSTARR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across architectures and datasets, improving open-set recognition.

Conclusion: COSTARR advances open-set recognition by utilizing attenuation information, demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

*Yuekun Dai,Haitian Li,Shangchen Zhou,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trans-Adapter enables diffusion-based inpainting models to handle RGBA images directly, improving transparency consistency and edge quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods are limited to RGB images, and conventional RGBA inpainting pipelines struggle with transparency consistency and edge quality.

Method: Proposes Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter for diffusion-based models, supporting ControlNet for controllable editing. Introduces LayerBench and a new alpha edge quality metric.

Result: Extensive experiments on LayerBench demonstrate Trans-Adapter's effectiveness in preserving transparency and improving edge quality.

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter successfully addresses RGBA inpainting challenges, offering a versatile and high-quality solution.

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Yizhou Zhao,Haoyu Chen,Chunjiang Liu,Zhenyang Li,Charles Herrmann,Junhwa Hur,Yinxiao Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Bhiksha Raj,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MASIV is a vision-based framework for material-agnostic system identification, using learnable neural constitutive models to infer object dynamics without predefined material priors. It addresses challenges with dense geometric guidance and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability to handle unknown materials. MASIV aims to overcome this by being material-agnostic.

Method: MASIV employs learnable neural constitutive models and introduces dense geometric guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories for stable optimization.

Result: MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Conclusion: MASIV successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by being material-agnostic and leveraging dense geometric guidance, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EARL, an RL-based image editing model, combining supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a unified autoregressive multimodal framework. RL with a large multi-modal LLM verifier proves most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance across diverse image editing tasks by exploring and integrating multiple strategies (SFT, RL, CoT) in a unified framework.

Method: Adopts an autoregressive multimodal model processing text and visual tokens uniformly, testing SFT, RL, and CoT. RL with a multi-modal LLM verifier is prioritized.

Result: EARL, the RL-based model, outperforms baselines on diverse edits with less training data, advancing autoregressive multimodal models in image editing.

Conclusion: EARL demonstrates the effectiveness of RL in image editing, offering a competitive, data-efficient solution. The model and resources are publicly released.

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniEgoMotion, a unified model for egocentric motion generation and forecasting using first-person images, addressing limitations of third-person methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing AR/VR, human-robot interaction, assistive tech, and healthcare by improving egocentric motion prediction and synthesis.

Method: Proposes UniEgoMotion, a conditional motion diffusion model with head-centric motion representation, leveraging first-person visual inputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and generates motion from a single egocentric image.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling, enabling novel applications in egocentric contexts.

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed, achieving high performance on brain MRI and industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance in anomaly detection, particularly for brain MRI volumes.

Method: Integrates DRL with feature representations, trained on healthy subject MRI data (IXI dataset) and validated/tested on unhealthy subject data (BraTS 2021). Preprocessing included normalization and skull-stripping.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI, outperforming SOTA. Also showed strong performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on industrial datasets.

Conclusion: The DRL-based approach is robust, generalizable, and efficient, showing promise for real-world clinical and industrial applications.

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

### [23] [Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01139)
*Huyu Wu,Duo Su,Junjie Hou,Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC3 improves dataset condensation by addressing color's dual role, using a latent diffusion model for color compensation, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with inefficiency or semantic distortion; DC3 addresses color's overlooked role in condensation.

Method: DC3 uses a calibrated selection strategy and latent diffusion model to enhance color diversity in condensed images.

Result: DC3 outperforms SOTA methods, avoids model collapse, and achieves high-quality datasets.

Conclusion: DC3 demonstrates superior performance and generalization, proving feasibility of training with condensed datasets.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered

OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework for adapting text-to-image diffusion models to individual user safety preferences, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety mechanisms in text-to-image models lack personalization, ignoring diverse user needs based on age, mental health, and beliefs.

Method: PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process using a cross-attention mechanism and a new dataset, Sage, to tailor safety behaviors.

Result: PSA achieves better harmful content suppression and alignment with user preferences, scoring higher in Win Rate and Pass Rate metrics.

Conclusion: PSA effectively personalizes safety in generative models while maintaining image quality, with publicly available resources for further use.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LawDIS is a controllable dichotomous image segmentation framework using language and window-based controls for high-quality mask generation, outperforming 11 state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image segmentation by integrating user controls (language prompts and adjustable windows) for personalized and high-accuracy applications.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model with macro (language-controlled segmentation) and micro (window-controlled refinement) modes, coordinated by a mode switcher.

Result: Outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods, achieving significant gains in metrics like F_β^ω (4.6% with LS+WR, 3.6% with LS alone).

Conclusion: LawDIS is effective for high-quality, user-controlled image segmentation, with potential for personalized applications.

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of STR due to complex visual appearances and limited semantic priors without relying on external pretraining or adding inference overhead.

Method: Inject ground-truth text as auxiliary input, encode target labels into embedding space, and apply loss-aware masking to simulate curriculum learning.

Result: Models trained with TEACH show improved accuracy across benchmarks, especially in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: TEACH is a robust, model-agnostic method that enhances STR performance without external dependencies or added inference costs.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dense long-term 3D point tracking are computationally expensive, particularly with transformer-based iterative tracking and correlation feature computation.

Method: Introduces a coarse-to-fine tracking strategy starting with a small subset of points and expanding trajectories using a learnable interpolation module. Also optimizes correlation feature computation.

Result: Achieves a 5-100x speedup over prior methods while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses computational bottlenecks, enabling faster and accurate 3D point tracking.

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: SPFSplat is a framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images without ground-truth poses, using a shared feature backbone to predict primitives and poses in one step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D Gaussian splatting without relying on ground-truth poses, addressing practical challenges in novel view synthesis and pose estimation.

Method: Uses a shared feature extraction backbone for simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space, with rendering and reprojection losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis under significant viewpoint changes and outperforms methods with geometry priors in pose estimation.

Conclusion: SPFSplat's pose-free training and efficient design make it practical for real-world applications, with superior performance in novel view synthesis and pose estimation.

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

*Xinhang Wan,Dongqiang Gou,Xinwang Liu,En Zhu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for 3D affordance grounding and classification in Embodied AI, addressing inconsistencies and scale issues in prior methods by learning an affordance-aware 3D representation and using a stage-wise inference strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object manipulation learning in Embodied AI by addressing the limitations of previous methods, which tackled affordance grounding and classification separately and struggled with incomplete or fixed-scale predictions.

Method: The approach involves learning an affordance-aware 3D representation through cross-modal fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, followed by a two-stage prediction mechanism to couple grounding and classification tasks.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms previous approaches in both affordance grounding and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the dependency and scale issues in affordance understanding, leading to improved performance in Embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding is introduced to improve object perception in autonomous driving by using voxel-level annotations instead of bounding boxes. The proposed model, GroundingOcc, outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding tasks rely on bounding boxes, which lack fine-grained details and lead to inaccurate object representations.

Method: GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model, integrates visual, textual, and point cloud features for voxel-wise predictions and refined localization, enhanced by 2D grounding and depth estimation modules.

Result: GroundingOcc outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding, demonstrating improved precision.

Conclusion: The benchmark and GroundingOcc model advance 3D occupancy grounding, offering more accurate object perception for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional infrastructure inspection methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming, prompting the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Deep learning models were applied to analyze over 3,000 satellite images of pavement sections, paired with ratings from TxDOT's PMIS database.

Result: The study achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 90% in evaluating pavement conditions.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates a rapid, cost-effective approach for future pavement network evaluations using satellite imagery and deep learning.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning

*Tianze Wang,Zhang Zhang,Chao Yue,Nuoran Li,Chao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoadMamba, a novel method combining local and global perception using DualSSM and DAF, achieves state-of-the-art performance in road surface classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving autonomous vehicle safety and comfort by accurately classifying road surface conditions using visual technologies.

Method: Proposes RoadMamba with DualSSM for global semantics and local texture extraction, fused via DAF, and a dual auxiliary loss for balanced learning.

Result: Achieves top performance on a large-scale dataset with 1 million samples.

Conclusion: RoadMamba effectively combines local and global features for superior road surface classification.

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

### [34] [StyDeco: Unsupervised Style Transfer with Distilling Priors and Semantic Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01215)
*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco is an unsupervised framework for style transfer that addresses the semantic gap in text-driven diffusion models by learning tailored text representations and outperforms existing methods in fidelity and structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven diffusion models treat textual descriptions uniformly, ignoring the spatial-semantic gap in visual style, leading to loss of detail and structure.

Method: StyDeco uses Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD) to synthesize pseudo-paired data unsupervised and Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD) to adapt text encoders for style transfer.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods on three benchmarks, excelling in stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, and supports de-stylization.

Conclusion: StyDeco effectively bridges the semantic gap in text-driven style transfer, offering superior performance and extensibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

### [35] [Perspective from a Broader Context: Can Room Style Knowledge Help Visual Floorplan Localization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01216)
*Bolei Chen,Shengsheng Yan,Yongzheng Cui,Jiaxu Kang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using visual scene context to improve floorplan localization (FLoc) by pre-training a room discriminator with unsupervised learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FLoc methods rely on 2D structural cues or 3D geometry, missing richer visual context. This work aims to leverage scene layout priors to reduce localization ambiguity.

Method: An unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints pre-trains a room discriminator on unlabeled room images. This discriminator identifies room types and injects scene context into FLoc algorithms.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, showing improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating scene context via unsupervised learning enhances FLoc performance, addressing ambiguity in repetitive floorplan structures.

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

*Yujian Liu,Linlang Cao,Chuang Chen,Fanyu Geng,Dongxu Shen,Peng Cao,Shidang Xu,Xiaoli Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGaFace improves 3D head avatar reconstruction by refining geometry and texture during Gaussian rendering, addressing misalignment issues with FLAME meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, leading to poor rendering quality and loss of details.

Method: MoGaFace introduces Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry for alignment and Latent Texture Attention for texture refinement.

Result: MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and better novel-view synthesis, even with inaccurate mesh initialization.

Conclusion: MoGaFace effectively addresses misalignment and enhances rendering quality for 3D head avatars.

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

*Anzhe Cheng,Chenzhong Yin,Mingxi Cheng,Shukai Duan,Shahin Nazarian,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes weights in an orthonormal eigenbasis to improve feature clarity and learning dynamics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image classification and cross-modal retrieval. It also enables a BP-free variant for faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) suffer from disordered weight structures due to gradient-based optimization, harming feature clarity and learning dynamics.

Method: ENN reparameterizes each layer's weights in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis, enforcing decorrelated and well-aligned weight dynamics. It also introduces a BP-free variant (ENN-ℓ) for efficient local learning.

Result: ENN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and sets a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. ENN-ℓ achieves over 2× training speedup and surpasses end-to-end backpropagation accuracy.

Conclusion: ENN addresses representational flaws in DNNs, enhancing performance and enabling efficient, parallelizable training.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

TL;DR: ParaRevSNN is a parallel reversible SNN architecture that reduces latency while maintaining memory efficiency, achieving faster training and inference without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RevSNNs suffer from high latency due to sequential computation, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes ParaRevSNN, which decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks to enable inter-block parallelism while preserving reversibility.

Result: ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard RevSNNs, reducing training time by up to 35.2% and inference time to 18.15%.

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN is a promising solution for efficient deployment of reversible SNNs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

### [39] [Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01225)
*Xinyu Chen,Haotian Zhai,Can Zhang,Xiupeng Shi,Ruirui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) method to improve model performance in zero-shot settings by addressing unreliable low-entropy samples and enhancing intra-class compactness. MCP++ further refines this with cross-modal alignment and residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on low-entropy samples, which may be unreliable under distribution shifts, leading to suboptimal intra-class compactness.

Method: The study introduces MCP with three caches (entropy, align, negative) and MCP++, which adds cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning.

Result: Experiments on 15 downstream tasks show state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MCP and MCP++ effectively address limitations of existing methods, achieving superior performance in zero-shot test-time adaptation.

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

*Zihan Fang,Zhiyong Xu,Lan Du,Shide Du,Zhiling Cai,Shiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view open-set learning framework is proposed to address class incompleteness and view-induced biases by using ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view learning models fail in open-set scenarios due to class incompleteness assumptions and static view-induced biases.

Method: The framework includes O-Mix for generating ambiguous samples, an ambiguity perception network, and an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module.

Result: The framework improves unknown-class recognition while maintaining closed-set performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles open-set challenges in multi-view learning.

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

*Mingyu Fu,Wei Suo,Ji Ma,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACCM reduces computational costs in LVLMs by compensating for visual information loss with adaptive captions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of LVLMs due to long visual sequences limit their applications, and existing pruning methods degrade performance.

Method: ACCM uses a lightweight caption model and selector to generate and choose contextually appropriate captions, trained via self-supervised learning.

Result: ACCM outperforms SOTA methods, achieving 20.6% better performance with 6.5% fewer FLOPs across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACCM effectively mitigates visual information loss while reducing computational costs, enhancing LVLM practicality.

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCSplats, a novel 3DGS-based framework, improves anti-noise reconstruction by leveraging epistemic uncertainty, hybrid noise assessment, and dynamic anchor points for label noise classification, achieving robust performance across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in real-world 3D reconstruction (e.g., moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces) causes errors. Existing methods struggle with noise separation or require impractical scene-specific tuning.

Method: Proposes OCSplats, combining hybrid noise assessment, observation-based cognitive correction, and a dynamic anchor point pipeline for label noise classification.

Result: OCSplats achieves leading reconstruction accuracy and precise noise classification across varying noise proportions and scene complexities.

Conclusion: OCSplats offers a practical, parameter-free solution for robust 3D reconstruction in noisy environments, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

TL;DR: NS-Net improves AI-generated image detection by decoupling semantic info from CLIP features using NULL-Space projection and contrastive learning, achieving 7.4% higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the failure of existing detectors to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when real and fake images have similar semantic content.

Method: Proposes NS-Net, using NULL-Space projection to remove semantic info from CLIP features, contrastive learning for distributional differences, and Patch Selection to preserve fine-grained artifacts.

Result: NS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.4% in detection accuracy on a benchmark of 40 generative models.

Conclusion: NS-Net demonstrates strong generalization across GAN- and diffusion-based models, offering a robust solution for detecting AI-generated images.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP) to reduce annotation costs by using weak supervision like image-level labels and natural language descriptions, addressing challenges with DisFaceRep, a disentanglement framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face parsing methods require expensive dense pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive. The goal is to reduce annotation costs using weak supervision.

Method: Proposes DisFaceRep, a framework with explicit (co-occurring component disentanglement) and implicit (text-guided loss) mechanisms to separate facial components.

Result: DisFaceRep outperforms existing weakly supervised methods on datasets like CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen.

Conclusion: WSFP is challenging but DisFaceRep effectively addresses it, offering a cost-efficient solution for face parsing.

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be

Motivation: To tackle real-world adaptability challenges in object detection, including domain and category shifts, by creating a comprehensive benchmark and a novel detection method.

Method: Uses large language models to generate domain-agnostic text prompts for category embedding and learns domain-specific embeddings from images, integrating them during testing.

Result: The proposed method is validated through benchmark evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and the utility of the OD-LVIS benchmark.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses ODOV detection, proving the method's superiority and the benchmark's value for real-world object detection evaluation.

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zihan Li,Wei Sun,Jing Hu,Jianhua Yin,Jianlong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-enhanced framework improves image clustering by aligning cross-modal semantic consistency and fine-tuning the encoder, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods freeze encoders in large language-image models, creating a mismatch between task-agnostic representations and clustering demands, limiting performance.

Method: The framework uses cross-modal semantic consistency to align clustering heads with pre-trained model semantics, then fine-tunes the encoder using self-generated pseudo-labels.

Result: Outperforms existing deep clustering methods on six datasets, with a ViT-B/32 model matching or surpassing larger ViT-L/14 models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between generic pre-trained features and task-specific clustering needs, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STDNet, a SpatioTemporal Difference Network, to address long-tailed distribution issues in video depth super-resolution by leveraging spatial and temporal difference mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth super-resolution suffers from long-tailed distributions in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones, limiting reconstruction quality.

Method: STDNet uses two branches: a spatial difference branch for intra-frame RGB-D alignment and a temporal difference branch for motion compensation using adjacent frames.

Result: STDNet outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed STDNet effectively mitigates long-tailed effects in video depth super-resolution, improving reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of

### [48] [Enhancing Diffusion-based Dataset Distillation via Adversary-Guided Curriculum Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01264)
*Lexiao Zou,Gongwei Chen,Yanda Chen,Miao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS) to enhance dataset distillation by improving diversity and reducing redundancy in images sampled from diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset distillation struggles with performance degradation as image-per-class or resolution increases, and diffusion models, while effective, often produce images lacking diversity.

Method: ACS partitions the distilled dataset into curricula, using adversarial loss to guide diffusion sampling and challenge a discriminator, ensuring diverse and systematic coverage.

Result: ACS achieves improvements of 4.1% on Imagewoof and 2.1% on ImageNet-1k over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ACS effectively addresses diversity issues in dataset distillation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

*Pedro Alonso,Tianrui Li,Chongshou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModelNet40-E is a new benchmark for evaluating point cloud classification models under LiDAR-like noise, featuring noise-corrupted data and uncertainty annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess robustness and calibration of models under synthetic noise, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.

Method: Evaluates PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer v3 using classification accuracy, calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness across noise levels.

Result: All models degrade with noise, but Point Transformer v3 shows better calibration and alignment with measurement uncertainty.

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E is effective for evaluating model robustness, with Point Transformer v3 outperforming in calibration.

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

### [50] [SGCap: Decoding Semantic Group for Zero-shot Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01270)
*Zeyu Pan,Ping Li,Wenxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGCap introduces a zero-shot video captioning method using Semantic Group Decoding and Key Sentences Selection to model temporal dynamics and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot image captioning methods fail to capture video temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal performance in video captioning.

Method: Proposes Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) with Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) for multi-frame modeling and Key Sentences Selection (KSS) for diverse supervision.

Result: SGCap outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods and rivals supervised ones on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGCap effectively addresses temporal dynamics in zero-shot video captioning, achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

### [51] [PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01272)
*Zonglei Jing,Xiao Yang,Xiaoqian Li,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Mingchuan Zhang,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe is a gated prompt tuning framework for T2I models that dynamically adjusts defensive strength based on prompt toxicity, achieving low unsafe generation rates while preserving benign image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models often produce NSFW content, and existing moderation methods are computationally expensive, degrade benign outputs, and lack adaptability to diverse safety needs.

Method: Uses a text-only training corpus (rewritten unsafe prompts via LLM) to optimize a universal soft prompt and introduces a gated control network for adaptive defense.

Result: Achieves 2.36% unsafe generation rate, maintains high benign fidelity, and generalizes well to unseen harmful categories and model architectures.

Conclusion: PromptSafe offers a practical, scalable solution for safe T2I deployment with strong performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

### [52] [Integrating Disparity Confidence Estimation into Relative Depth Prior-Guided Unsupervised Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01275)
*Chuang-Wei Liu,Mingjian Sun,Cairong Zhao,Hanli Wang,Alexander Dvorkovich,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised stereo matching framework using depth priors and confidence estimation to improve accuracy, outperforming existing methods on KITTI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised stereo matching avoids costly annotations but suffers from ambiguities like repetitive patterns. Existing methods inefficiently use 3D geometric knowledge.

Method: A plug-and-play disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions are introduced. Quasi-dense correspondences and dual disparity smoothness loss enhance learning.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI Stereo benchmarks among unsupervised approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses stereo matching ambiguities and improves performance by leveraging depth priors and confidence estimation.

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

### [53] [GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01293)
*Ngoc Bui Lam Quang,Nam Le Nguyen Binh,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Quan Nguyen,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-language MIL framework improves WSI classification by using multi-agent description generation and a list-based text encoding strategy for better alignment with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using LLMs for clinical descriptions in MIL pipelines face limitations in expressiveness, domain grounding, and fine-grained specificity.

Method: Proposes a grounded multi-agent system for generating diverse clinical descriptions and a list-based text encoding strategy.

Result: Outperforms single-prompt baselines and matches state-of-the-art performance on renal and lung cancer datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the expressiveness and alignment of clinical descriptions with visual features, improving MIL for pathology slides.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

### [54] [Domain Generalized Stereo Matching with Uncertainty-guided Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01303)
*Shuangli Du,Jing Wang,Minghua Zhao,Zhenyu Xu,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method to improve stereo matching models' generalization from synthetic to real data by perturbing RGB image statistics and enforcing feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo matching models trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world domain differences like color, illumination, and texture.

Method: UgDA perturbs RGB image statistics (mean, standard deviation) to simulate unseen domains, uses Gaussian distributions for uncertainty modeling, and enforces feature consistency between original and augmented data.

Result: Extensive experiments show UgDA significantly boosts generalization performance of stereo matching networks.

Conclusion: UgDA is a simple, architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing cross-domain generalization in stereo matching.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

*Haoquan Lu,Hanzhe Liang,Jie Zhang,Chenxi Hu,Jinbao Wang,Can Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes C3D-AD, a continual learning framework for 3D anomaly detection, handling new classes over time with generalized feature extraction and memory retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection methods are class-specific and cannot adapt to new classes, limiting their practical application.

Method: Introduces Kernel Attention Layer (KAL) for feature extraction, Kernel Attention with Advisor (KAA) for learning new classes, and Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) for memory retention.

Result: Achieves 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD datasets.

Conclusion: C3D-AD effectively handles multi-class and emerging-class 3D anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: We present a novel algebraic solution to the Perspective-Three-Point (P3P)
problem, which aims to recover the absolute pose of a calibrated camera from
three 2D-3D correspondences. Our method reformulates the problem into a quartic
polynomial with coefficients that are analytically simple and computationally

TL;DR: A novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture improves distal myopathy diagnosis by combining global and local deep learning features, enhancing accuracy and interpretability, though gaps in clinical specificity remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing distal myopathy is challenging due to its genetic heterogeneity and varied clinical manifestations, necessitating improved radiological methods.

Method: Proposes a fusion architecture integrating global and local deep learning features via an attention gate mechanism, evaluated on BUSI and proprietary datasets.

Result: Achieves high classification accuracy and generates clinically relevant saliency maps, but gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness persist.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for richer interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet real-world clinical expectations.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

*Jiaxing Yang,Lihe Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework, CSINet, addresses scale variation in remote sensing by combining cross-view semantics and collaborative attention for better segmentation of tiny, ambiguous targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with tiny, ambiguous targets in remote sensing due to reliance on single-view structures and saliency-preferring techniques.

Method: CSINet uses a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) and a Collaboratively Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to integrate global and local semantics from remote and close views.

Result: The framework improves segmentation accuracy for small targets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: CSINet effectively addresses scale variation and enhances segmentation performance in remote sensing.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting erythema without requiring annotated training data, leveraging generative models for scalable dermatological diagnostics.

Method: Uses edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models to synthesize reference images free from erythema, aligns them with original images, and performs color-space analysis for detection.

Result: Successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, outperforming baseline threshold-based techniques.

Conclusion: Combining generative diffusion models and color segmentation enables efficient erythema detection without prior training data, offering a scalable diagnostic tool.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

TL;DR: StyleSentinel protects artwork copyright by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint, outperforming existing methods in one-sample verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized use of personal artwork via diffusion models threatens artists' intellectual property; current defenses (e.g., watermarks) are inadequate.

Method: Enhances stylistic expressiveness via semantic self-reconstruction, fuses multi-layer features for a stylistic fingerprint, and models style as a hypersphere boundary for one-class learning.

Result: Superior performance in one-sample verification compared to state-of-the-art methods; effective in online tests.

Conclusion: StyleSentinel offers a robust solution for copyright protection by leveraging stylistic fingerprints, validated by experiments and online platforms.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLaCo is a vision-language framework for weakly supervised image forgery localization, leveraging pre-trained models to enhance accuracy with image-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing weakly supervised methods by incorporating external semantic guidance for better localization.

Method: Uses a vision-language feature modeling network, adaptive reasoning network, dual prediction heads, and a contrastive patch consistency module.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in detection and localization accuracy on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: ViLaCo effectively bridges the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video OCL methods lack next-frame feature integration and fail to learn transition dynamics, limiting query prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes RandSF.Q: a new transitioner using slot-feature pairs and random sampling to learn dynamics.

Result: Achieves up to 10-point improvement in object discovery and benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: RandSF.Q sets a new state-of-the-art in video OCL by addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

*Jie Wei,Erika Ardiles-Cruz,Aleksey Panasyuk,Erik Blasch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve damage assessment in HADR by addressing data imbalance and labeling inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods underperform in HADR due to data imbalance and human labeling errors.

Method: Leverage VLMs to fuse imagery with human knowledge for diversified data generation.

Result: Initial results show improved classification of structural damage levels.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a promising solution for accurate and efficient damage assessment in HADR.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

### [65] [A Full-Stage Refined Proposal Algorithm for Suppressing False Positives in Two-Stage CNN-Based Detection Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01382)
*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm to reduce false positives in pedestrian detection by refining proposals at both training and testing stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False positives in pedestrian detection remain unresolved, prompting the need for an effective solution.

Method: The FRP algorithm employs feature re-evaluation strategies: TFRP for training validation, CFRP for classifier-guided proposals, and SFRP for split-proposal confidence evaluation.

Result: Experiments show FRP effectively reduces false positives and enhances detection, even on resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: The FRP algorithm significantly improves pedestrian detection by suppressing false positives across all stages.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

*Fengyun Li,Chao Zheng,Yangyang Fang,Jialiang Lan,Jianhua Liang,Luhao Zhang,Fa Si*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fast Window Attention (FWA), a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, addressing computational imbalance in hybrid models. It also proposes LOLViT, a hybrid backbone network, showing superior performance in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The imbalance in computational efficiency between CNNs and attention mechanisms, along with persistent computational saturation issues in lightweight models, motivates the need for an adaptive solution.

Method: Proposes FWA for adaptive feature map reduction and a global-local feature fusion mechanism combined with GhostNet to create LOLViT.

Result: LOLViT outperforms CNN models in speed and accuracy, with LOLViT-X being 5x faster than MobileViT-X.

Conclusion: The adaptive FWA and LOLViT hybrid network effectively address computational inefficiencies, offering a balanced and high-performing solution for lightweight models.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

### [67] [Construction of Digital Terrain Maps from Multi-view Satellite Imagery using Neural Volume Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01386)
*Josef X. Biberstein,Guilherme Cavalheiro,Juyeop Han,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural Terrain Maps (NTM) adapt neural volume rendering to create textured digital terrain maps from satellite imagery, eliminating the need for manual preprocessing and structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view stereo pipelines for digital terrain maps (DTMs) are cumbersome and require manual preprocessing, limiting scalability for ambitious robotic exploration missions.

Method: NTM learns DTMs directly from satellite imagery using neural volume rendering, requiring only pixel loci without depth or structural priors.

Result: NTM achieves terrain prediction precision nearly matching satellite image resolution, even with imperfect camera data, as validated on synthetic and real Earth/Mars datasets.

Conclusion: NTM offers a promising alternative to traditional DTM methods, reducing manual effort while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

*Pouya Parsa,Keya Li,Kara M. Kockelman,Seongjin Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vision-language models (VLMs) for license plate and vehicle make/model recognition in dynamic video settings, achieving high accuracy and proposing a self-reflection module for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ALPR and vehicle recognition using handheld or non-static cameras, leveraging VLMs for cost-effective, scalable solutions.

Method: Proposes pipelines for ALPR and make/model recognition using VLMs with multimodal prompts and a self-reflection module for correction.

Result: Achieves 91.67% ALPR and 66.67% make/model accuracy on a smartphone dataset, with further improvements via self-reflection.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a scalable, cost-effective approach for dynamic traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

### [69] [Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval: Finding People Through Distinctive and Novel Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01389)
*Minjeong Park,Hongbeen Park,Sangwon Lee,Yoonha Jang,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) to handle novel attributes in real-world scenarios, proposing a framework for generalizable body part representations and reconstructing datasets for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAR methods assume closed-set attributes, limiting real-world applicability where novel attributes emerge. Predefined attributes are also less discriminative for person retrieval.

Method: Proposes the OAPR task and a framework to learn generalizable body part representations for diverse attributes. Reconstructs four datasets for open-attribute recognition.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate the necessity of OAPR and the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The OAPR task addresses real-world limitations, and the proposed framework shows promise for open-attribute recognition.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

### [70] [Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01396)
*Zhuohua Ye,Liming Zhang,Hongru Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAE enhances RAW image object detection by combining spatial and frequency domains, preserving details through inverse frequency transformation and cross-domain fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW data's wide dynamic range and linear response suppress object details, which spatial-domain methods struggle to recover.

Method: Proposes SFAE: spatializes frequency bands, fuses spatial and frequency features via attention, and applies adaptive nonlinear adjustments.

Result: Improved recovery of suppressed details in RAW images for better object detection.

Conclusion: SFAE effectively leverages frequency domain to enhance RAW-based object detection, outperforming spatial-only methods.

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForenX, a method using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), detects AI-generated images and provides human-like explanations. It improves forgery detection and explanation quality with a specialized forensic prompt and the ForgReason dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between AI-generated image detection methods and human cognitive forensic analysis drives the need for a system that not only detects but also explains authenticity.

Method: ForenX employs MLLMs with a forensic prompt to focus on forgery-indicative attributes and uses the ForgReason dataset, curated via LLM-human collaboration.

Result: ForenX enhances forgery detection generalization and provides accurate, relevant explanations, validated on major benchmarks.

Conclusion: ForenX bridges the gap between AI and human forensic analysis, improving detection and explainability with minimal manual annotations.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

### [72] [3DRot: 3D Rotation Augmentation for RGB-Based 3D Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01423)
*Shitian Yang,Deyu Li,Xiaoke Jiang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DRot is a plug-and-play augmentation method for RGB-based 3D tasks that preserves geometric consistency by rotating/mirroring images about the camera's optical center, improving performance in monocular 3D detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based 3D tasks face challenges due to scarce annotations and limited augmentation options that disrupt geometric consistency.

Method: 3DRot rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to maintain projective geometry.

Result: On SUN RGB-D, 3DRot improves IoU3D (43.21 to 44.51), reduces rotation error (22.91° to 20.93°), and boosts mAP0.5 (35.70 to 38.11).

Conclusion: 3DRot is effective for monocular 3D detection and is transferable to other 3D tasks due to its camera-space transform approach.

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECTRUM is a temporal-frequency synergistic model for online handwriting verification, combining temporal and frequency features for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock the potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification by integrating temporal and frequency features.

Method: Uses a multi-scale interactor, self-gated fusion module, and multi-domain distance-based verifier for temporal-frequency integration.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, enhancing discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting.

Conclusion: Validates multi-domain learning in OHV and suggests future research in multi-domain approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

*Zhuoran Peng,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-granularity non-local self-similarity prior model for HSI recovery, addressing limitations of fixed-format methods by alternating coarse and fine-grained tensor decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI recovery methods use fixed-format factors for non-local self-similarity, limiting adaptability to diverse missing scenarios.

Method: The model alternates coarse-grained (Tucker decomposition) and fine-grained (FCTN decomposition) tensor decompositions to capture global and local details.

Result: The model shows strong applicability and outstanding recovery in various missing scenarios like pixels and stripes.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-granularity approach effectively unifies global, local, and non-local priors for HSI recovery.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework predicts segmentation quality without ground truth annotations, using uncertainty maps and segmentation outputs, achieving high accuracy and robustness across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical settings lack manual annotations for segmentation quality assessment, creating adoption barriers for models without reliability indicators.

Method: Proposes two frameworks: one uses predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, the other integrates input images, uncertainty, and segmentation maps. Bayesian adaptations of SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50 are used, with uncertainty quantified via Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation.

Result: Achieves R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on HAM10000, and R2 score of 85.03 with Pearson correlation of 65.02 for 3D liver segmentation. Introduces an aggregation strategy for robust quality assessment.

Conclusion: The framework effectively predicts segmentation quality without ground truth, demonstrates cross-modality robustness, and provides interpretability through Grad-CAM and UMAP analysis.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

TL;DR: Can3Tok is a 3D scene-level VAE that encodes Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, addressing scale inconsistency and enabling novel scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation is limited to object-level; scene-level generation is underexplored due to challenges like scale inconsistency and lack of scalable latent representation learning.

Method: Introduces Can3Tok, a 3D scene-level VAE, and a pipeline for 3D scene data processing to handle scale inconsistency.

Result: Validated on DL3DV-10K, Can3Tok generalizes to novel scenes, outperforming methods that fail to converge or generalize.

Conclusion: Can3Tok enables effective scene-level generation, demonstrated via image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS applications.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

TL;DR: EfficientGFormer integrates pretrained models, graph reasoning, and efficiency mechanisms for accurate and fast 3D brain tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and high computational costs.

Method: Uses nnFormer for encoding MRI volumes into patch-level embeddings, structured into a dual-edge graph. A pruned GAT enables efficient reasoning, and a distillation module ensures real-time deployment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets with reduced memory and inference time.

Conclusion: EfficientGFormer provides a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for clinical tumor delineation.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced

*Kuo Shi,Jie Lu,Shanshan Ye,Guangquan Zhang,Zhen Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiraGe is a method for detecting AI-generated images by learning generator-invariant features, improving generalizability across unseen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors struggle with new or unseen generative models due to overlapping features. MiraGe aims to address this by enhancing feature discriminability.

Method: MiraGe minimizes intra-class variation and maximizes inter-class separation. It uses multimodal prompt learning with CLIP to refine discriminative representations.

Result: MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, even against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: MiraGe effectively generalizes AI-generated image detection by leveraging invariant features and multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReasonAct enhances video reasoning in small models via a three-stage training process, achieving significant accuracy improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale models struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning in video understanding, necessitating improved methods.

Method: Three-stage training: text-only reasoning, video fine-tuning, and temporal-aware reinforcement learning with T-GRPO and sub-action decomposition.

Result: Achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, outperforming baselines by 17.9, 15.8, and 12.3 points.

Conclusion: Progressive training enables small models to achieve competitive video reasoning efficiently.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: MagicVL-2B is a lightweight Vision-Language Model optimized for smartphones, reducing power consumption by 41.1% while matching state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational and storage challenges of deploying VLMs on mobile devices.

Method: Uses a lightweight visual encoder (<100M parameters), dynamic resolution scheme, and multimodal curriculum learning.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art accuracy with 41.1% lower power consumption.

Conclusion: MagicVL-2B is a practical solution for mobile vision-language applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

*Zeyu Xu,Junkang Zhang,Qiang Wang,Yi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-VRAG is a new video RAG framework that reduces computational costs by 70% and improves accuracy for video understanding tasks by using hierarchical query decomposition, a lightweight VLM, and a multi-view QA scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video RAG methods struggle with balancing retrieval efficiency and accuracy, especially for complex video content, and face high computational costs.

Method: E-VRAG uses hierarchical query decomposition for frame pre-filtering, a lightweight VLM for scoring, a global statistical distribution-based retrieval strategy, and a multi-view QA scheme.

Result: E-VRAG achieves a 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy on four benchmarks without additional training.

Conclusion: E-VRAG effectively improves efficiency and accuracy in video RAG tasks, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

*Quan-Sheng Zeng,Yunheng Li,Qilong Wang,Peng-Tao Jiang,Zuxuan Wu,Ming-Ming Cheng,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlimpsePrune dynamically prunes visual tokens in LVLMs, retaining baseline performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed compression ratios in LVLMs lead to imprecise pruning and degraded performance.

Method: Introduces GlimpsePrune, a dynamic pruning framework inspired by human cognition, which prunes irrelevant tokens in a single forward pass.

Result: Prunes 92.6% of tokens, retains baseline performance, and enables more effective fine-tuning (GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% baseline performance).

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune offers a powerful and efficient approach for LVLMs.

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

TL;DR: EvoVLMA automates the search for efficient training-free adaptation algorithms for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using LLM-assisted evolutionary methods, outperforming manual designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM adaptation methods are manually designed, requiring expertise and time. Automating this process could improve efficiency and performance.

Method: A two-stage LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm optimizes feature selection and logits computation, using low-precision code conversion and web-based execution for stability.

Result: EvoVLMA improves the APE algorithm by 1.91 points in 8-shot image classification accuracy.

Conclusion: EvoVLMA demonstrates the potential for automating adaptation algorithm design for multimodal models, offering better performance than manual methods.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework for LiDAR and RGB camera fusion to reduce energy consumption while maintaining 3D object detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR sensors ignore temporal continuity, causing redundancy and high power consumption, limiting practicality on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Uses a lightweight predictor network and differentiable Mask Generator with Gumbel-Softmax sampling to identify critical ROIs for adaptive scanning.

Result: Reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining or improving 3D object detection performance on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks.

Conclusion: The adaptive scanning framework efficiently balances energy use and detection accuracy, making it practical for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

*Yujia Tong,Tian Zhang,Jingling Yuan,Yuze Wang,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LetheViT is a contrastive unlearning method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses privacy compliance by selectively forgetting specific data while retaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA require models to forget user data upon request, posing challenges for ViTs. This work tackles random data forgetting in ViTs.

Method: LetheViT uses masked images (positive logits) and original images (negative logits) to guide unlearning, leveraging insights from selective masking experiments.

Result: LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, balancing privacy compliance and model efficacy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenge of data forgetting in ViTs, ensuring compliance without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

*Pengfei Gu,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Huimin Li,Chaoli Wang,Danny Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopoImages, a method to encode local topological structures in image patches using persistent homology, improving deep learning classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image processing methods often overlook topological structures, which are crucial for understanding image content, especially in biomedical applications.

Method: The approach computes persistence diagrams of image patches, vectorizes them into TopoImages, and fuses multi-view TopoImages with the original image for classification.

Result: Experiments on medical image datasets show improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TopoImages provide a versatile and effective way to integrate topological information into deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SECA leverages CLIP's textual priors for continual learning, addressing stability-plasticity trade-offs with semantic-guided knowledge transfer and visual prototype refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore CLIP's textual semantic priors for continual learning, mitigating interference from unrelated tasks and bridging the modality gap.

Method: Proposes SECA with SG-AKT for semantic-aware knowledge transfer and SE-VPR for refining visual prototypes using textual embeddings.

Result: Validated on benchmarks, SECA effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning.

Conclusion: SECA successfully integrates textual and visual semantics for improved continual learning performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Set Pivot Learning (SPL), a new paradigm for domain generalization using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), focusing on dynamic adaptation and VFM-centric tuning for better real-world alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain generalization (DG) assumes inaccessible target domains, but VFMs trained on diverse data challenge this. SPL redefines DG to better fit current needs.

Method: Proposes SPL with dynamic adaptation and VFM-centric tuning. Introduces Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning, combining a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter and Prompt-guided Feature Focuser.

Result: Experiments show SPL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, especially in generalized segmentation.

Conclusion: SPL offers a more adaptive and effective approach to domain generalization with VFMs, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

TL;DR: STCN is a novel two-stage method for stochastic human motion prediction, addressing mode collapse and temporal dynamics by using a spatio-temporal continuous network and an anchor set for GMM learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with continuous temporal dynamics and stochastic motion prediction, often leading to mode collapse and overlooking motion flexibility.

Method: STCN uses a two-stage approach: (1) a spatio-temporal continuous network for smoother sequences and (2) an anchor set to learn GMM and sample multiple sequences per anchor.

Result: STCN achieves competitive diversity and accuracy on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets.

Conclusion: STCN effectively addresses mode collapse and improves stochastic human motion prediction.

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

TL;DR: Pr^2R proposes a privacy-preserving replay method for lifelong person re-identification by condensing sequential data into pixel-space samples, improving accuracy and mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in replay-based LReID methods and performance degradation in exemplar-free approaches.

Method: Condenses training data into pixel-space samples, uses dual-alignment for style replay, and aligns domains to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Achieves 4-6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Pr^2R effectively balances privacy preservation and performance in lifelong person re-identification.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM is a novel framework for industrial anomaly detection using self-referential learning and dynamic reference selection to enhance anomaly discrimination, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection by dynamically refining detection through self-referential learning within test images, reducing reliance on pre-trained features.

Method: SNARM computes inter- and intra-residual features, uses a Mamba module with dynamic navigation, and aggregates results via ensemble learning.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks, with improvements in Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: SNARM effectively enhances anomaly detection by leveraging self-generated references and dynamic feature navigation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

TL;DR: DMTrack introduces a dual-adapter architecture (STMA and PMCA) for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatio-temporal multimodal tracking by bridging modality gaps and enabling better cross-modality fusion.

Method: Uses STMA for self-prompting spatio-temporal features and PMCA with shallow/deep adapters for progressive cross-modality prompting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks with only 0.93M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DMTrack's dual-adapter design effectively enhances multimodal tracking with efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

*Kai Han,Chongwen Lyu,Lele Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Siqi Ma,Zheng Pang,Jun Chen,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLIMD, a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis, addressing class imbalance in multimodal medical data by focusing on key samples and adapting to complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in multimodal medical data hinders accurate diagnosis, and existing methods like resampling or loss reweighting often lead to overfitting or underfitting while missing cross-modal interactions.

Method: CLIMD uses a multimodal curriculum measurer (intra-modal confidence and inter-modal complementarity) and a class distribution-guided training scheduler to adapt to imbalanced data.

Result: CLIMD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and handles imbalanced data effectively.

Conclusion: CLIMD is a versatile, plug-and-play framework that improves multimodal disease diagnosis accuracy and is publicly available.

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-PAN, a zero-shot framework for fine-grained brain tumor subtype classification, enhances patch-level features and uses LLM-generated descriptions to improve class separability, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fine-grained brain tumor subtype classification due to subtle morphological variations and limited annotated data.

Method: Proposes FG-PAN with a local feature refinement module and a fine-grained text description generation module using LLMs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot classification on datasets like EBRAINS and TCGA.

Conclusion: FG-PAN effectively improves fine-grained classification by aligning visual and semantic features, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

### [95] [Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01603)
*Yiheng Li,Zichang Tan,Zhen Lei,Xu Zhou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), a framework for detecting AI-generated images by dynamically adjusting prompts based on input, improving generalization to unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fine-tune pre-trained models but struggle with generalization to unknown image generators. IAPL aims to enhance adaptability to diverse forged images.

Method: IAPL includes two modules: Conditional Information Learner (for forgery-specific and image-specific conditions) and Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction (optimizes tokens and selects confident views).

Result: IAPL achieves 95.61% and 96.7% mean accuracy on UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: IAPL's adaptive approach significantly improves detection of AI-generated images, especially from unseen generators, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

*Lingyao Li,Runlong Yu,Qikai Hu,Bowei Li,Min Deng,Yang Zhou,Xiaowei Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMAGEO-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs for image geolocalization, revealing performance disparities and geospatial biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in image geolocalization, addressing gaps in understanding their spatial reasoning and biases.

Method: Benchmarking 10 LLMs using diverse datasets (global street scenes, US POIs, private images) to measure accuracy, distance error, bias, and reasoning.

Result: Closed-source models outperform open-source ones, with biases favoring high-resource regions. Success depends on recognizing urban settings, landmarks, etc.

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench highlights LLMs' spatial reasoning limitations and biases, guiding future geolocation-aware AI development.

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: LLaDA-MedV is a new biomedical vision-language model using masked diffusion, outperforming LLaVA-Med and LLaDA-V in tasks like visual conversation and VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore masked diffusion models in biomedical VLMs, where ARMs dominate, and improve performance in biomedical image understanding.

Method: Develops LLaDA-MedV, a large language diffusion model, using vision instruction tuning for biomedical applications.

Result: Achieves 7.855% and 1.867% gains over LLaVA-Med and LLaDA-V, respectively, and sets new SOTA on VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV demonstrates superior performance and informative outputs, with insights on training and inference optimization.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel preprocessing framework integrates a voxelization network with a G-PCC surrogate model to enhance compression efficiency while maintaining interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC underperforms compared to deep learning-based methods despite lower computational power. The goal is to improve G-PCC without sacrificing its advantages.

Method: Proposes a compression-oriented voxelization network and a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly optimized for rate-distortion trade-offs.

Result: Achieves a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction over G-PCC, with no decoder modifications or computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework bridges classical codecs with deep learning, offering a practical way to enhance legacy standards while preserving compatibility.

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module for glass surface segmentation using RGB-D data, introduces the MJU-Glass dataset, and demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass surfaces pose challenges like transparency, reflections, and occlusions, which complicate segmentation. The goal is to enhance segmentation accuracy for robotics applications to prevent collisions.

Method: The WFF module dynamically fuses RGB and depth features and is compatible with various deep neural networks. The MJU-Glass dataset provides real-world RGB-D data for benchmarking.

Result: The WFF module improves segmentation, with a 7.49% boost in boundary IoU when used with PSPNet.

Conclusion: The WFF module and MJU-Glass dataset offer a robust solution for glass segmentation, advancing robotics safety.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

### [100] [Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641)
*Yujian Liu,Yuechuan Lin,Dongxu Shen,Haoran Li,Yutong Wang,Xiaoli Liu,Shidang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CDSR, a framework for efficient and robust whole-slide image analysis using only 9 high-resolution patches per image, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIL approaches overlook feature extractor impact, leading to domain gaps and suboptimal representations. SSL methods split WSIs into small patches, degrading performance and increasing costs.

Method: CDSR uses a two-stage selective sampling strategy and a Local-to-Global Network to reconstruct high-resolution WSI representations efficiently.

Result: CDSR improves accuracy by 6.3% and AUC by 5.5% on classification tasks, using only 4.5% of patches compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CDSR is efficient and maintains morphological fidelity, outperforming dense-sampling or SSL pipelines with fewer patches.

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

TL;DR: A sketch-based strand generation model for realistic hair, offering precise control and user-friendliness, outperforming existing methods in realism and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for hair generation lack precision and user-friendliness, prompting the need for a sketch-based approach.

Method: Uses a learnable strand upsampling strategy and a multi-scale adaptive conditioning mechanism with a transformer and diffusion heads.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in realism and precision on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed sketch-based model effectively addresses precision and usability challenges in hair strand generation.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAG, a diffusion-based 3D affordance grounding framework, leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to improve generalization in predicting touchable regions on 3D objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D affordance grounding rely on demonstration images but fail to generalize well due to limited knowledge capture. The authors aim to leverage the rich affordance knowledge embedded in text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: The proposed DAG framework uses frozen internal representations of a text-to-image diffusion model, along with an affordance block and multi-source affordance decoder, to predict 3D dense affordance.

Result: Experiments show DAG outperforms established methods and demonstrates strong open-world generalization.

Conclusion: The DAG framework effectively unlocks affordance knowledge in diffusion models, advancing 3D affordance grounding with improved generalization.

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

TL;DR: A novel map-level perspective (MAP) is introduced to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by interpreting hidden states as a 2D semantic map, improving factual consistency without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations—generating grammatically correct but visually inconsistent content. Existing methods focus on localized regions, missing distributed factual information.

Method: Proposes Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), using Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention and Global-Local Logit Fusion to refine token representations and predictions.

Result: MAP improves LVLM performance on benchmarks like POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, enhancing truthfulness and consistency.

Conclusion: The map-level decoding strategy effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs, demonstrating its potential for improving multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

*Zhixuan Li,Yujia Liu,Chen Hui,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA is a novel amodal segmentation method using point-based prompts and explicit contour evolution for better generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing amodal segmentation methods rely on strong prompts or lack geometric interpretability, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: VELA uses a velocity-driven level-set approach, evolving contours from point prompts via a differentiable network predicting shape-specific motion fields.

Result: VELA outperforms existing methods on benchmarks (COCOA-cls, D2SA, KINS) with only a single-point prompt.

Conclusion: VELA offers interpretable, geometrically grounded amodal segmentation, demonstrating effectiveness under weak guidance.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeMoE introduces a shape-specific sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation, improving performance by dynamically routing objects to specialized experts based on shape characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with diverse amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity, leading to mismatched expert routing and insufficient specialization.

Method: ShapeMoE learns a latent shape distribution space, encodes objects into Gaussian embeddings, and uses a Shape-Aware Sparse Router to dynamically route objects to specialized experts.

Result: ShapeMoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA, particularly in occluded region segmentation.

Conclusion: ShapeMoE provides interpretable, efficient, and high-capacity amodal segmentation by leveraging shape-specific expert routing.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein++ is an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework addressing data scale disparity and domain shifts in semantic segmentation. It includes Rein-G for domain generalization and Rein-A for domain adaptation, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of applying Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to semantic segmentation due to smaller datasets and diverse domain shifts motivate the development of Rein++.

Method: Rein++ combines Rein-G (instance-aware tokens for feature refinement) and Rein-A (unsupervised domain adaptation at instance and logit levels). It fine-tunes <1% of backbone parameters and leverages SAM for boundary enhancement.

Result: Rein++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust generalization and adaptation to diverse domains without target labels.

Conclusion: Rein++ is an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive solution for semantic segmentation with VFMs, even for large models.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of

### [107] [Benchmarking Adversarial Patch Selection and Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01676)
*Shai Kimhi,Avi Mendlson,Moshe Kimhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchMap is the first benchmark for adversarial patch placement, revealing vulnerable spots in vision models. A simple segmentation-based method improves attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patch attacks undermine vision model reliability, necessitating a systematic study of patch placement effects.

Method: PatchMap evaluates 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet to identify vulnerable regions. A segmentation-guided heuristic improves patch placement without gradient queries.

Result: PatchMap shows small patches (2% of image) can cause misclassifications. The proposed method boosts attack success rates by 8-13 percentage points.

Conclusion: PatchMap accelerates research on defenses and attacks, with public release of data and code.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

*Zhaochen Wang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image embeds text instructions into images to reduce hallucination in VLMs. It improves Qwen2.5-VL but harms LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP due to attention bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucination in VLMs caused by misaligned multimodal information.

Method: Embedding textual instructions directly into images to unify processing through the visual channel.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL's performance improves (POPE accuracy +4.1%), while LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP suffer severe drops.

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image enhances cross-modal alignment for robust models like Qwen but fails for CLIP-based encoders due to attention bias.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

*Yufeng Chi,Huimin Ma,Kafeng Wang,Jianmin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo3D improves 3D editing by distilling 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor, achieving better multi-view consistency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to 3D editing is challenging due to multi-view inconsistency and slow convergence.

Method: DisCo3D fine-tunes a 3D generator with multi-view inputs, trains a 2D editor via consistency distillation, and optimizes outputs with Gaussian Splatting.

Result: DisCo3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality and maintains multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: DisCo3D effectively addresses 3D editing challenges with improved consistency and quality.

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

### [110] [Register Anything: Estimating "Corresponding Prompts" for Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697)
*Shiqi Huang,Tingfa Xu,Wen Yan,Dean Barratt,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PromptReg, a training-free image registration method using pre-trained segmentation models to simplify region-based correspondence into a single step by searching for corresponding prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional region-based correspondence in image registration involves two steps: segmenting ROIs and matching them. The paper aims to simplify this into one step for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The method involves identifying corresponding prompts between images, inverting prompts into the target image's prompt space, and marginalizing prompts for registration.

Result: PromptReg outperforms intensity-based and learning-based methods across five applications, achieving competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: PromptReg simplifies and improves image registration by leveraging pre-trained models and prompt-based correspondence, demonstrating superior performance without requiring training data.

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

*Zuhao Yang,Jiahui Zhang,Yingchen Yu,Shijian Lu,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTG is a framework for generating smooth and coherent video transitions between given frames using text prompts, addressing challenges like object identity preservation and motion smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video generation lack exploration in smooth and rational transitions between given frames with text guidance.

Method: VTG uses interpolation-based initialization, dual-directional motion fine-tuning, and representation alignment regularization to enhance transition quality.

Result: VTG outperforms in generating high-fidelity, semantically coherent transitions, validated on the TransitBench benchmark.

Conclusion: VTG advances transition video generation, offering a robust solution for tasks like concept blending and scene transitions.

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeExpert is a Mixture-of-Experts-based Video-LLM that dynamically routes task-specific tokens for improved Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs process all task tokens uniformly, lacking specialization for distinct VTG subtasks like temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation.

Method: TimeExpert uses a Mixture-of-Experts framework to dynamically route task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, enhancing computational efficiency and precision.

Result: TimeExpert achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTG tasks like Dense Video Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Conclusion: TimeExpert's specialized routing mechanism improves event modeling and outperforms existing methods in diverse VTG applications.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

*Luqi Cheng,Zhangshuo Qi,Zijie Zhou,Chao Lu,Guangming Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LT-Gaussian is a method for updating 3D-GS-based maps in autonomous driving, using multimodal splatting, change detection, and targeted updates to efficiently handle environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating 3D-Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) maps is costly; LT-Gaussian addresses this by enabling efficient updates without full reconstruction.

Method: Uses Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection, and Gaussian-Map Update to compare old maps with new LiDAR data for targeted updates.

Result: LT-Gaussian efficiently updates maps, handles environmental changes, and produces higher quality reconstructions than rebuilding from scratch.

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian is effective for updating 3D-GS maps in autonomous driving, leveraging old and new data for better results.

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

TL;DR: GAID improves text-to-video retrieval by integrating audio-visual features adaptively and enhancing text embeddings with structured perturbations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook audio semantics or use coarse fusion, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations.

Method: GAID uses Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) for fine-grained audio-visual alignment and Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) for robust text embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX with efficiency gains.

Conclusion: GAID's fusion and perturbation modules complement each other, yielding stable and expressive representations.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of multimodal content and lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets make hate speech detection in videos challenging.

Method: HateClipSeg provides video-level and segment-level annotations (11,714 segments) across five offensive categories. A three-stage annotation process ensures high agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). Three benchmark tasks are proposed.

Result: Results show significant gaps in current models, indicating the need for advanced multimodal and temporally aware approaches.

Conclusion: HateClipSeg addresses dataset limitations and sets benchmarks for future research in hate speech detection.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing

video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results
highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more
sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TOPICS+, an enhanced variant of the TOPICS method for class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) in robotic surgery, addressing class imbalances and dynamic environments. It proposes new benchmarks and a refined dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate scene understanding in dynamic surgical environments requires models to adapt continually without forgetting prior knowledge, which static datasets fail to address.

Method: TOPICS+ incorporates Dice loss for class imbalance, hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and tailored taxonomies for surgery. It also introduces new CISS benchmarks and a refined dataset.

Result: The method is tailored for robust segmentation in surgical scenes, with benchmarks and a dataset (144+ classes) provided for evaluation.

Conclusion: TOPICS+ advances CISS for robotic surgery, offering practical tools (code, models, benchmarks) for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Granular Concept Circuit (GCC), a method for discovering circuits in deep vision models that encode specific visual concepts, enabling fine-grained interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where and how visual concepts are encoded in deep vision models is challenging due to distributed representations.

Method: GCC iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on functional dependencies and semantic alignment to construct circuits for specific concepts.

Result: GCC effectively identifies fine-grained circuits tied to visual concepts across various deep image classification models.

Conclusion: GCC provides a profound, concept-wise interpretation of models, advancing interpretability in deep vision architectures.

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT improves multi-object tracking in UAV videos by jointly using appearance and motion cues with AMC and MTC modules, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in UAV videos like viewpoint changes and complex motion dynamics lead to unstable tracking. Existing methods ignore spatio-temporal interplay of cues.

Method: Proposes AMOT with AMC matrix for bi-directional spatial consistency and MTC module for track reactivation, combining appearance and motion cues.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV benchmarks, generalizing well without training.

Conclusion: AMOT effectively addresses UAV tracking challenges by integrating appearance and motion cues, improving performance and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

TL;DR: SpectralX is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to handle diverse spectral imagery without extensive pretraining, improving domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of foundation models for multispectral/hyperspectral data and leverage spectral imagery advantages in earth observation.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Masked-reconstruction task with Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) and Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA); 2) Semantic segmentation with Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter).

Result: Improved domain generalization for interpreting spectral imagery from new regions or seasons.

Conclusion: SpectralX effectively adapts RSFMs for diverse spectral modalities without extensive pretraining, enhancing performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

TL;DR: AG$^2$aussian introduces an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features in 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving segmentation and Gaussian selection for scene understanding and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations result in noisy segmentation and messy Gaussian selections, necessitating a more structured approach.

Method: The framework uses an anchor-graph structure to regulate Gaussian primitives, promoting compact, instance-aware distributions and enabling graph-based propagation.

Result: AG$^2$aussian achieves clean, accurate instance-level Gaussian selection, validated across four applications like interactive query and object removal.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effectiveness in improving semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations, benefiting diverse applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

*Ruofan Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xuan Tong,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEA introduces a grey-box jailbreak method for fine-tuned VLMs, achieving high transfer attack success by simulating parameter shifts and guiding adversarial outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in fine-tuned VLMs inherited from base models, demonstrating the risk of transferable jailbreak attacks.

Method: SEA combines Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG) to generate transferable adversarial images and steer outputs.

Result: SEA achieves 86.5% transfer attack success and 49.5% toxicity rates across fine-tuned VLMs, even safety-enhanced ones.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to protect fine-tuned VLMs from inherited vulnerabilities, urging holistic defenses.

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing

### [122] [Intention-Guided Cognitive Reasoning for Egocentric Long-Term Action Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01742)
*Qiaohui Chu,Haoyu Zhang,Meng Liu,Yisen Feng,Haoxiang Shi,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a two-stage framework for egocentric action anticipation, addressing limitations in fine-grained cues, semantic dependencies, and cognitive reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing long-term action anticipation for proactive AI assistance by addressing underutilized visual cues, neglected semantic dependencies, and lack of cognitive reasoning.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) extracts hand-object interaction features and uses verb-noun co-occurrence; 2) employs reinforcement learning for cognitive reasoning (perception, inference, anticipation).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: INSIGHT effectively addresses key limitations and advances egocentric action anticipation with its unified approach.

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

### [123] [Improving Noise Efficiency in Privacy-preserving Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01749)
*Runkai Zheng,Vishnu Asutosh Dasu,Yinong Oliver Wang,Haohan Wang,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves private dataset distillation by decoupling sampling from optimization and enhancing signal quality, achieving significant performance gains with fewer images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in machine learning by efficiently generating synthetic datasets without compromising privacy, while overcoming inefficiencies in current private dataset distillation methods.

Method: Introduces a framework that decouples sampling from optimization and improves signal quality by mitigating DP noise through matching in an informative subspace.

Result: Achieves a 10.0% improvement with 50 images per class and an 8.3% increase with one-fifth the distilled set size of previous methods on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential to advance privacy-preserving dataset distillation by efficiently utilizing private information.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

*Kumail Abbas,Zeeshan Afzal,Aqeel Raza,Taha Mansouri,Andrew W. Dowsey,Chaidate Inchaisri,Ali Alameer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-camera, real-time tracking system using advanced computer vision techniques was developed to monitor dairy cow activity, achieving high accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual monitoring of dairy cow activity is laborious and inconsistent, necessitating an automated system for accurate health and welfare assessment.

Method: The system integrates six camera feeds with homographic transformations, uses YOLO11-m for detection, SAMURAI for segmentation, and a motion-aware Kalman filter for tracking.

Result: Achieved MOTA of 98.7% and 99.3%, IDF1 scores above 99%, and near-zero identity switches, outperforming Deep SORT Realtime.

Conclusion: The system enables real-time, accurate cow tracking in complex environments, aiding early sickness prediction and farm productivity.

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

### [125] [VPN: Visual Prompt Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01766)
*Shuo Feng,Zihan Wang,Yuchen Li,Rui Kong,Hengyi Cai,Shuaiqiang Wang,Gim Hee Lee,Piji Li,Shuqiang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a method for guiding embodied agents using visual prompts instead of language, reducing ambiguity and improving navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language-guided navigation suffers from ambiguity and verbosity, making it less effective for non-expert users. VPN aims to provide intuitive, spatially grounded guidance.

Method: VPN uses visual prompts (trajectory markings on 2D top-view maps) and introduces VPNet, a baseline network with view-level and trajectory-level data augmentation to enhance performance.

Result: Two new datasets (R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP) are created, and experiments evaluate the impact of visual prompt forms, map formats, and augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: VPN offers a more effective and user-friendly alternative to language-guided navigation, with promising results demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffSemanticFusion combines raster and graph representations for improved autonomous driving tasks like trajectory prediction and planning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of raster-based (lack of geometric precision) and graph-based (instability without precise maps) representations in HD map generation for autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes DiffSemanticFusion, a fusion framework using a semantic raster-fused BEV space and a map diffusion module to enhance stability and expressiveness.

Result: Achieves 5.1% improvement in trajectory prediction on nuScenes and 15% gain in end-to-end driving on NAVSIM, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion effectively combines raster and graph strengths, validated by superior performance and seamless integration into other approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

*Xiaotong Zhang,Alexander Broersen,Gonnie CM van Erp,Silvia L. Pintea,Jouke Dijkstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A point-based method for Couinaud liver segmentation without explicit prior vessel structure, using graph reasoning to learn anatomical affinities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preoperative liver surgery planning requires accurate segmentation, but existing point-based methods rely on time-consuming prior vessel knowledge.

Method: Proposes a point-based approach with a graph reasoning module to implicitly learn liver vessel structure from point neighborhoods.

Result: Competitive performance on MSD and LiTS datasets in Dice coefficient and surface distance metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively segments liver Couinaud regions without explicit prior vessel knowledge, improving efficiency.

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

TL;DR: The paper addresses signer-independent recognition in Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) using a data-centric approach, achieving competitive results with a novel CSLRConformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization in CSLR systems across diverse signers by tackling challenges like fluid transitions and co-articulation.

Method: Proposes feature engineering, preprocessing (DBSCAN filtering, normalization), and the CSLRConformer, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.

Result: Achieved 5.60% WER on development and 12.01% on test sets, ranking 3rd in the competition.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful adaptation of the Conformer model from speech to CSLR, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

TL;DR: A novel 3D hand motion recovery framework uses diffusion-based and physics-augmented refinement to improve accuracy and coherence in hand-object interactions, trained without annotated video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating accurate and temporally coherent 3D hand motion estimates from videos, especially during hand-object interactions.

Method: A diffusion-based and physics-augmented motion refinement model trained on motion capture data, integrating intuitive physics knowledge like key motion states and constraints.

Result: Significantly improves frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances 3D hand motion recovery by combining diffusion models with physics insights, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: A hierarchical algebraic method estimates camera pose relative to a planar target using ≥4 reference points, refining robustness with noise averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately estimate camera pose relative to a planar target from reference points and bearing measurements, addressing noise sensitivity.

Method: Hierarchical approach: first estimates the target plane's normal, then camera position, distance, and full orientation, with noise averaging for robustness.

Result: Validated through experiments, showing accurate and robust pose estimation.

Conclusion: The method effectively estimates camera pose with improved noise robustness.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniEvent is a unified event representation learning framework for event cameras, eliminating task-specific designs and achieving SOTA performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event networks rely on task-specific designs due to unstructured data and spatial-temporal inhomogeneity, limiting reusability.

Method: Proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm: local feature aggregation in spatial/temporal domains, space-filling curves for efficiency, and attention-based fusion.

Result: Outperforms task-specific SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 tasks and 10 datasets.

Conclusion: OmniEvent enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture changes, offering a unified, efficient solution.

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand adversarial attacks' impact on neural network robustness and security, and their potential defensive applications.

Method: Systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies in pixel-space, physically realizable, and latent-space domains, tracing technical evolution.

Result: Identifies critical research gaps, provides a taxonomy, and highlights future directions for robust computer vision systems.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks challenge neural network assumptions but also offer defensive insights, necessitating further research for trustworthy systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model to reduce video redundancy by leveraging spatio-temporal contexts more efficiently, addressing issues of model complexity and spatial dependency ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional entropy models for video redundancy reduction introduce high computational costs and lack explicit modeling of spatial dependency order, limiting context availability during decoding.

Method: CGT uses a temporal context resampler with transformer encoders and a teacher-student network for dependency-weighted spatial context. The teacher generates attention and entropy maps to guide the student in selecting top-k tokens.

Result: CGT reduces entropy modeling time by ~65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The CGT model effectively balances computational efficiency and performance by improving spatio-temporal context utilization.

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates classifying target vs. non-target fixations in realistic visual search scenes using gaze and EEG data, outperforming prior methods with 83.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research lacked realism by using abstract stimuli and ignoring scene context, limiting generalizability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Conducted a 36-participant study with 140 realistic scenes (e.g., icons on desktops, tools in workshops) and used gaze and EEG features for classification.

Result: Achieved 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art (56.9%).

Conclusion: The approach advances realistic visual search analysis, demonstrating higher accuracy and generalizability across scene types.

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionFF is a new framework for face forgery detection that uses diffusion models to localize manipulation artifacts, improving accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust and accurate face forgery detection, especially with precise artifact localization, to enhance model explainability and user trust.

Method: Uses a denoising diffusion model to generate DSSIM maps for artifact localization, fused with semantic features from a pretrained detector.

Result: Achieves superior detection performance and fine-grained artifact localization on cross- and intra-dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF is effective for both detection and localization, making it a valuable tool for face forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall

TL;DR: Proposes StreamAgent for real-time video understanding, integrating anticipation and proactive decision-making to improve responsiveness in dynamic streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods in real-time video processing, which lack proactive planning and future anticipation, hindering responsiveness in evolving scenarios like autonomous driving.

Method: Introduces StreamAgent, which anticipates task-relevant spatiotemporal regions, integrates question semantics, and uses a streaming KV-cache memory for efficient inference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and real-time efficiency on streaming and long video tasks.

Conclusion: StreamAgent enhances proactive decision-making and responsiveness, proving practical for real-world streaming applications.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating DICOM image de-identification workflows was developed, using synthetic PHI/PII in a publicly accessible dataset to ensure privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ensuring patient privacy in medical imaging data sharing while maintaining scientific utility and DICOM validity.

Method: Created the MIDI dataset with synthetic PHI/PII embedded in DICOM files, accompanied by evaluation tools for benchmarking de-identification workflows.

Result: The dataset includes 538 subjects, 53,581 DICOM images, and tools for automated comparison, aligning with HIPAA and DICOM standards.

Conclusion: The framework enables objective, standards-driven evaluation of de-identification workflows, enhancing safer medical image sharing.

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoTrigger uses audio cues to selectively activate power-intensive cameras in smart glasses, reducing energy use by 54% while maintaining performance for memory enhancement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart glasses for all-day use face energy efficiency challenges due to continuous sensing. EgoTrigger addresses this by intelligently managing sensors.

Method: EgoTrigger employs a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and custom classifier to trigger cameras based on hand-object interaction sounds.

Result: EgoTrigger reduces frame usage by 54%, saving energy without compromising performance on memory tasks.

Conclusion: Context-aware triggering like EgoTrigger is promising for energy-efficient smart glasses, supporting applications like memory enhancement.

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

*Conor Wallace,Isaac Corley,Jonathan Lwowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InspectVLM, a unified vision-language model, shows promise for industrial inspection but falls short in robustness and precision compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the viability of unified vision-language models (VLMs) for industrial inspection, aiming to simplify complex task-specific pipelines.

Method: InspectVLM, based on Florence-2 and trained on InspectMM, is tested on classification, detection, and keypoint tasks.

Result: Competitive in classification and keypoint tasks but underperforms in detection and robustness, showing brittle behavior and memorized responses.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack visual grounding and robustness for precision-critical industrial inspections despite their conceptual appeal.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

TL;DR: IAUNet introduces a query-based U-Net architecture with a lightweight Pixel decoder and Transformer decoder, outperforming state-of-the-art models in biomedical instance segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve instance segmentation in biomedical imaging, especially for overlapping cells, by leveraging U-Net's potential in query-based approaches.

Method: IAUNet combines a full U-Net architecture with a lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder and a Transformer decoder for multi-scale feature refinement.

Result: IAUNet outperforms existing models on public datasets and the new Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset.

Conclusion: IAUNet sets a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation, offering efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBOM is a proactive framework using structured disentanglement to detect and neutralize backdoor threats in datasets, including unseen trigger-object configurations, leveraging Vision-Language Models for zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks and generative AI are vulnerable to backdoor attacks with multiple triggers, evading standard detection. A proactive solution is needed to identify and neutralize such threats.

Method: DBOM uses Vision-Language Models to disentangle triggers and objects as independent primitives in embedding space, employing visual prompt tuning and separation losses for feature disentanglement.

Result: DBOM robustly detects poisoned images on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB, enhancing DNN training pipeline security by generalizing to unseen trigger-object pairings.

Conclusion: DBOM effectively addresses backdoor threats by disentangling and neutralizing triggers and objects, offering a secure solution for DNN training pipelines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Result: Superior performance in accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude pose estimation compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The system is well-suited for applications like aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated inspection.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-altitude camera pose estimation system, addressing
the challenges of robust and accurate localization across varied altitudes when
only considering sparse image input. The system effectively handles diverse

transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework.
To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly
collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose
estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks
compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic
applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated
inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) to reduce reliance on labeled data for YOLO object detectors, showing improved performance with unlabeled pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dependency of YOLO detectors on large labeled datasets by leveraging unlabeled data through SSL.

Method: Adapts YOLO backbones as encoders, uses SimCLR framework for pretraining on unlabeled COCO images, and fine-tunes on a cyclist detection task.

Result: SSL pretraining improves mAP, convergence speed, and precision-recall, with YOLOv8 achieving 0.7663 mAP@50:95, outperforming supervised training.

Conclusion: Contrastive SSL is effective for label-efficient object detection, demonstrating the value of unlabeled data for one-stage detectors.

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large data volume from AVs poses storage, bandwidth, and processing challenges, necessitating efficient downsampling methods.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) Object Presence Detection using unsupervised and supervised classifiers, (2) Sampling Budget Allocation to retain object info.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on KITTI and nuScenes datasets across varying sampling rates.

Conclusion: The method is model-agnostic, scalable, and integrates well with downstream models, enhancing AV point cloud processing.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on explicit program execution with manually defined modules, limiting scalability and adaptability. The goal is to create a more flexible and precise framework.

Method: IMoRe uses structured program functions for precise reasoning and a program-guided reading mechanism to dynamically select multi-level motion representations from a pretrained motion ViT.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes well to a new dataset based on HuMMan.

Conclusion: IMoRe demonstrates superior adaptability and precision in motion reasoning, offering a scalable solution for diverse motion Q&A tasks.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with identifying subtle visual cues in melanoma detection, prompting the need for a more comprehensive approach.

Method: The framework uses a dual-pathway structure with dual attention and multi-scale feature aggregation to capture fine-grained and contextual details.

Result: The model achieves higher accuracy and better resilience against false positives on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The work advances automated skin cancer recognition and demonstrates the effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on

TL;DR: A novel NLOS imaging method reduces computational and memory costs by using 2D functions and a Quasi-Fresnel transform, enabling real-time, high-resolution imaging on lightweight devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLOS imaging methods are computationally expensive due to 3D modeling, limiting practical applications and real-time performance on lightweight devices.

Method: The approach represents hidden scenes with 2D functions and uses a Quasi-Fresnel transform for direct inversion, reducing complexity and memory usage.

Result: The method cuts runtime and memory demands by orders of magnitude while preserving imaging quality, enabling NLOS imaging on mobile and embedded systems.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging on lightweight platforms, expanding its practical applications.

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

*Kyungmin Jo,Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in text-to-image diffusion models by improving image prompts through conflict-free guidance and a new self-attention method, Stratified Attention, to better reflect intricate details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture fine details in image prompts due to conflicting signals in classifier-free guidance and a trade-off between realism and alignment.

Method: Proposes conflict-free guidance to avoid conflicting signals and Stratified Attention to balance realism and alignment by jointly using keys and values from both images.

Result: Outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting image prompts across three generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively resolves issues in existing approaches, ensuring better alignment with image prompts while maintaining realism.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

TL;DR: Bench2ADVLM introduces a closed-loop evaluation framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in autonomous driving, addressing gaps in current open-loop protocols by enabling real-time, interactive testing across simulation and physical platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for VLM-based autonomous driving systems (ADVLMs) are limited to open-loop settings, missing the realism and safety insights of closed-loop interactions.

Method: The framework uses a dual-system adaptation architecture to translate high-level driving commands into mid-level actions for simulation, and a physical control layer for real-world execution. It also includes a self-reflective scenario generation module.

Result: Experiments show ADVLMs perform poorly under closed-loop conditions, highlighting the framework's diagnostic capabilities.

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM provides a comprehensive, hierarchical evaluation pipeline for ADVLMs, revealing their limitations and advancing closed-loop testing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

Method: Encapsulates 3D facial signatures into pose-invariant 2D representations, dynamically deforming them into natural-looking 3D masks for online sharing.

Result: Significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across black-box FR models and performs 2x better than existing methods.

Conclusion: Protego effectively combats misuse of FR for surveillance and identity tracing, offering robust privacy protection.

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

*Hui Xie,Haiqin Hu,Lijuan Ding,Qing Li,Yue Sun,Tao Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose is a novel conditional diffusion model for radiotherapy dose prediction, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiotherapy planning is time-consuming and expert-dependent, while existing deep learning methods lack generalization and clinical applicability.

Method: The model uses LightweightVAE3D for CT data compression, integrates multimodal inputs, and employs a progressive noise addition-denoising framework with multi-head attention and a composite loss function.

Result: ADDiff-Dose outperforms baselines with lower MAE (0.101-0.154), higher DICE (0.927), and faster planning (22 seconds/case).

Conclusion: The model offers a generalizable, efficient solution for automated radiotherapy planning, reducing time and improving workflow.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

*Sparsh Garg,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new validation set, MVV, is introduced for fine-grained traffic sign annotation, showing DINOv2 outperforms VLMs in recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets like Mapillary for accurate autonomous driving decisions.

Method: Creation of MVV dataset with pixel-level instance masks, manually annotated by experts, and benchmarking VLMs against DINOv2.

Result: DINOv2 consistently outperforms VLMs in traffic sign recognition and other categories, highlighting VLMs' limitations.

Conclusion: MVV and DINOv2 establish a foundation for more reliable and scalable perception systems in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

### [154] [HCF: Hierarchical Cascade Framework for Distributed Multi-Stage Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02051)
*Junhao Cai,Taegun An,Chengjun Jin,Sung Il Choi,JuHyun Park,Changhee Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) for distributed multi-stage image compression, improving efficiency and performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in progressive and successive compression methods, and the lack of flexibility in fixed-parameter models for multi-stage image compression.

Method: Developed HCF with latent-space transformations and policy-driven quantization control, leveraging differential entropy analysis for optimization.

Result: Achieved up to 0.6dB PSNR gains, outperformed successive-compression by 5.56% BD-Rate, and saved significant computational resources (up to 97.8% FLOPs).

Conclusion: HCF offers superior rate-distortion performance, computational efficiency, and flexibility for distributed multi-stage image compression.

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

*Haoxin Yang,Weihong Chen,Xuemiao Xu,Cheng Xu,Peng Xiao,Cuifeng Sun,Shaoyu Huang,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StarPose is an autoregressive diffusion framework for monocular 3D human pose estimation, enhancing accuracy and temporal consistency by integrating historical pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack spatial and temporal correlations, leading to inconsistent and inaccurate 3D pose sequences.

Method: StarPose models 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process, using a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM) and Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism.

Result: StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and temporal consistency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: StarPose effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering robust and realistic 3D human pose estimates.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Zhanyu Wang,Xinyu Liang,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured radiology report generation (S-RRG) approach using an LLM-based model, a new dataset (MIMIC-STRUC), and a specialized evaluation metric (S-Score) for clinically relevant report quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional free-text radiology reports are inconsistent and redundant, complicating clinical detail extraction. Structured reports offer a solution but existing methods lack expressiveness and clinical relevance.

Method: The approach includes constructing a structured chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC), training an LLM-based model for standardized reports, and introducing the S-Score evaluation metric.

Result: The proposed method generates high-quality, structured reports and demonstrates stronger alignment with human assessments through the S-Score.

Conclusion: Structured reports and tailored evaluation metrics improve clinical relevance and report quality in radiology.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

TL;DR: VLM4D benchmark evaluates VLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning, revealing gaps in dynamic understanding compared to humans. Proposed solutions include 4D feature fields and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack dynamic spatiotemporal reasoning abilities, which are crucial for real-world understanding.

Method: Introduces VLM4D benchmark with diverse videos and QA pairs to test VLMs on motion, perspective, and continuity.

Result: VLMs underperform humans, struggling with visual cue integration and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Targeted improvements like 4D feature fields show promise, urging further research for better dynamic visual intelligence.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

TL;DR: Human-X is a real-time framework for physically plausible human interactions in VR/AR and robotics, outperforming existing methods in motion quality and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in real-time, physically feasible, and safe human-machine interactions in immersive systems.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner for joint action-reaction prediction and an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement learning.

Result: Shows significant improvements in motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility on Inter-X and InterHuman datasets.

Conclusion: Human-X advances human-robot collaboration, validated in real-world VR/AR and robotics applications.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation addresses challenges in deploying large-scale image generation models, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical deployment of photorealistic image generation models is limited by intractability to parameter fine-tuning and challenges in utilizing distributed LoRA modules.

Method: Introduces a framework with a weight encoding-based LoRA retriever and a fine-grained gated fusion mechanism for optimal LoRA integration.

Result: Significant improvement in image generation performance, enabling scalable and data-efficient enhancement of foundational models.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment, fostering collaborative model evolution.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

TL;DR: DeflareMamba introduces state space models for lens flare removal, addressing contextual inconsistency with a hierarchical framework and local-enhanced state space models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lens flare removal is challenging due to complex optical interactions, and existing methods often fail to maintain contextual consistency.

Method: Uses a hierarchical framework with varied stride sampling for long-range pixel correlations and local-enhanced state space models to preserve details.

Result: Effectively removes various flare artifacts while maintaining natural non-flare regions, improving downstream tasks like object recognition.

Conclusion: DeflareMamba is the first to apply state space models to flare removal, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility.

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

*Mingjie Liu,Hanqing Liu,Chuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRE-Net improves object detection in adverse lighting by fusing RGB, event data, and predicted normal maps, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse lighting causes false detections in event cameras; RGB and event data alone are insufficient. Robust geometric cues are needed.

Method: NRE-Net fuses RGB, event streams, and normal maps using ADFM and EAFM modules for optimized multi-modal integration.

Result: Achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based methods, and surpasses fusion-based methods by 2.7% and 7.1%.

Conclusion: NRE-Net effectively addresses adverse lighting challenges by leveraging multi-modal fusion, enhancing detection accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

TL;DR: A novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework improves dynamic urban scene modeling by leveraging test-time adapted video diffusion for robust, temporally consistent priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with pre-calibrated object tracks and fast-moving objects due to temporal discontinuities and undersampled capture.

Method: Proposes a joint timestamp optimization strategy for pose alignment and uncertainty distillation for adaptive content extraction.

Result: Achieves ~2 dB PSNR gain in novel view synthesis, especially for fast-moving objects.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances dynamic modeling by addressing temporal inconsistencies and undersampling challenges.

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

*Behnaz Kavoosighafi,Rafal K. Mantiuk,Saghi Hajisharif,Ehsan Miandji,Jonas Unger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation is introduced, operating directly in BRDF space without rendering, outperforming traditional metrics in correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BRDF-space metrics fail to capture perceptual differences in rendered images, necessitating a perceptually informed alternative.

Method: A compact MLP is trained on measured and synthetic BRDF data, labeled using a perceptually validated image-space metric, to predict perceptual quality (JOD scores).

Result: The neural metric achieves higher correlation with human judgments than existing BRDF-space metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides a perceptually grounded alternative for BRDF evaluation, though its use as a loss function for fitting is limited.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

TL;DR: Free-MoRef is a training-free approach for Video-MLLMs to handle long videos efficiently by splitting and fusing vision tokens, improving performance and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-MLLMs struggle with long videos due to context length limitations, sacrificing granularity or efficiency. Free-MoRef addresses this without training.

Method: Free-MoRef splits vision tokens into short sequences (multi-references), uses MoRef-attention to gather clues in parallel, and fuses key tokens for cross-reference interactions.

Result: Free-MoRef achieves 2× to 8× longer input frame perception without compression, outperforming trained long-video-MLLMs on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: Free-MoRef efficiently enhances Video-MLLMs for long videos, offering significant performance gains and computational savings.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

*Daniel Lengerer,Mathias Pechinger,Klaus Bogenberger,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AID4AD, a dataset combining aerial imagery with nuScenes for AV perception tasks, showing improved accuracy in map construction and motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AV perception by integrating spatially aligned aerial imagery, especially where high-definition maps are impractical.

Method: AID4AD aligns aerial imagery with nuScenes using SLAM-based maps, proposes an alignment workflow, and includes manual quality control.

Result: Aerial imagery improves map construction accuracy by 15-23% and trajectory prediction by 2%.

Conclusion: AID4AD demonstrates aerial imagery's value for AV systems, offering a scalable alternative to high-definition maps.

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

*Shaoxiong Zhang,Jinkai Zheng,Shangdong Zhu,Chenggang Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackletGait improves gait recognition in real-world scenarios with novel methods like Random Tracklet Sampling, Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling, and Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in gait recognition for real-world surveillance, where conventional methods fail due to non-periodic and occluded sequences.

Method: Proposes TrackletGait with Random Tracklet Sampling, Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling, and Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss to enhance robustness and representation.

Result: Achieves 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D and GREW datasets with only 10.3M parameters.

Conclusion: TrackletGait effectively addresses real-world gait recognition challenges and sets new benchmarks.

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

*Ziyang Luo,Nian Liu,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURORA improves audio-visual segmentation by enhancing reasoning and language comprehension through structured CoT prompting and feature distillation, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic understanding and compromise precision; AURORA addresses these by integrating reasoning and segmentation effectively.

Method: Uses Chain-of-Thought prompting, segmentation feature distillation loss, and a two-stage training strategy (corrective reflective-style training and GRPO).

Result: AURORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes well.

Conclusion: AURORA effectively combines reasoning and segmentation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

*Die Chen,Zhongjie Duan,Zhiwen Li,Cen Chen,Daoyuan Chen,Yaliang Li,Yinda Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriCtrl is a plug-and-play framework for precise, continuous control of aesthetic attributes in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing ambiguity in textual prompts and scalability issues of human preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes in text-to-image generation is challenging due to vague textual prompts and reliance on costly human preference data.

Method: AttriCtrl quantifies aesthetics using semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models and employs a lightweight value encoder to map scalar intensities to embeddings in diffusion models.

Result: AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over individual attributes and flexible multi-attribute composition, with seamless integration into existing frameworks.

Conclusion: AttriCtrl offers intuitive, customizable aesthetic manipulation with minimal training overhead, demonstrating strong practical utility in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

*Yi Liu,Junjing Li,Yang Chen,Haowei Tang,Pengcheng Zhang,Tianling Lyu,Zhiguo Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using the Chambolle-Pock (CP) framework is proposed for convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and dictionary learning (CDL), offering faster convergence without manual parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADMM-based CSC methods require careful parameter selection, risking slow or no convergence. The CP framework avoids this issue.

Method: The CP framework is applied to CSC and CDL, with an anisotropic total variation penalty for CSC.

Result: The CP-based method matches ADMM performance for noise-free images and excels in denoising Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The CP framework is a fast, efficient alternative to ADMM for CSC and CDL, with superior noise removal capabilities.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPainter addresses e-commerce background generation challenges by combining text prompts and reference images, outperforming existing methods with high product consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in e-commerce background generation include product consistency and spatial harmony, which existing inpainting methods fail to address due to lack of domain-specific data and reliance on text prompts alone.

Method: Introduces DreamEcom-400K dataset and DreamPainter framework, leveraging text prompts and reference images for precise control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high product consistency and effective integration of control signals.

Conclusion: DreamPainter successfully addresses e-commerce background generation challenges by combining text and visual control signals.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified model for object detection and 3D pose estimation in RGB images achieves state-of-the-art results, improving accuracy by 22.9% and demonstrating robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications require 3D pose estimation, but traditional methods rely on RGB-D inputs or separate models for detection and pose estimation, which are limiting.

Method: The paper introduces a unified model integrating detection and pose estimation using neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC for RGB images.

Result: The approach improves state-of-the-art RGB category-level pose estimation by 22.9% on REAL275 and shows greater robustness than single-stage baselines.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively combines detection and pose estimation, offering improved performance and robustness for RGB-based applications.

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and

*Jia-Chen Zhang,Yu-Jie Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EST-LoRA is a training-free LoRA fusion method that adaptively balances subject and style contributions in generation tasks, outperforming existing methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA fusion methods struggle to balance subject and style and often require additional training, while existing training-free methods like K-LoRA involve complex hyperparameters.

Method: EST-LoRA integrates Energy of matrix, Style discrepancy scores, and Time steps to adaptively select between subject and style LoRA in each attention layer, inspired by Mixture of Experts.

Result: EST-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations and achieves faster generation speed.

Conclusion: EST-LoRA provides an effective, training-free solution for balanced subject-style generation, with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

*Florin-Alexandru Vasluianu,Tim Seizinger,Zongwei Wu,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL3AN is a dataset for restoring images under colored lights to ambient-normalized versions, addressing oversimplified lighting assumptions in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify illumination, ignoring complexities like colored lights and material interactions.

Method: A novel learning framework uses chromaticity and luminance guidance inspired by the Retinex model.

Result: The approach reduces artifacts like color distortion and texture leakage, performing robustly under varied lighting.

Conclusion: CL3AN and the proposed framework improve image restoration under complex lighting, with competitive computational cost.

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianCross introduces a cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning method using 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve point cloud discrimination and structural information, achieving superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods suffer from model collapse and structural information deficiency due to insufficient point discrimination, leading to unreliable representations.

Method: GaussianCross converts point clouds into a unified Gaussian representation and uses a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module to capture appearance, geometry, and semantic features.

Result: The method achieves high efficiency with minimal parameters and data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks like ScanNet and S3DIS.

Conclusion: GaussianCross effectively addresses current challenges, demonstrating strong generalization and performance improvements in 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

TL;DR: The paper presents a Python algorithm for de-identifying PII and PHI in DICOM files, customizable for user needs, and compliant with HIPAA standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal requirements under HIPAA mandate the de-identification of PII and PHI in medical images, including DICOM files, to protect patient privacy.

Method: The algorithm uses the HIPAA safe harbor method, with customizable parameters to classify and de-identify DICOM tags.

Result: Sensitive information like names, history, and institution data was successfully recognized and de-identified.

Conclusion: The flexible, customizable algorithm is promising for both research and practical use, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WMMT, a weakly supervised method for multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization in Deepfake videos, achieving comparable results to fully supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused trust issues and social instability, but existing methods lack systematic research on weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization (WS-MTFL).

Method: WMMT uses multitask learning for video-level annotations, combining visual and audio detection as binary classification tasks. It employs a Mixture-of-Experts structure, a feature enhancement module, and a deviation perceiving loss for precise localization.

Result: WMMT achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods in Deepfake detection and localization, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed WMMT effectively addresses WS-MTFL, showcasing the potential of weakly supervised learning in this domain.

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework for quantized models to address performance degradation in dynamic environments, achieving efficiency with only two forward passes and domain knowledge management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized models suffer severe performance degradation in dynamic environments, and existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are impractical due to gradient backpropagation constraints.

Method: Introduces ZOA for efficient adaptation using two forward passes and a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse knowledge with minimal memory.

Result: ZOA improves robustness and generalization, achieving a 5.0% performance boost over state-of-the-art methods on quantized models like ViT-B.

Conclusion: ZOA is a practical and efficient solution for adapting quantized models in dynamic environments, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The
source code is available at https://github.com/DengZeshuai/ZOA.

*Yanyun Wang,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that over-learning hard adversarial samples in Adversarial Training (AT) degrades model robustness. It proposes Robust Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) to smooth perception transitions, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness in AT is attributed to over-learning hard adversarial samples, not insufficient learning.

Method: Introduces Robust Perception, a new AT objective, and RPAT to encourage smooth perception changes with input perturbations.

Result: RPAT outperforms baselines and SOTA methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with various architectures.

Conclusion: RPAT effectively mitigates the accuracy-robustness trade-off by addressing over-learning of hard adversarial samples.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the

### [180] [CMIC: Content-Adaptive Mamba for Learned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02192)
*Yunuo Chen,Zezheng Lyu,Bing He,Hongwei Hu,Qi Wang,Yuan Tian,Li Song,Wenjun Zhang,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAM introduces content-aware token reorganization and global priors in SSMs for improved learned image compression, outperforming VTM-21.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla Mamba's fixed selective scans limit dynamic content dependency exploitation, prompting the need for a content-adaptive approach.

Method: CAM uses content-aware token clustering and reordering, plus global priors via a prompt dictionary, to enhance SSMs.

Result: CMIC achieves -15.91%, -21.34%, and -17.58% BD-rate improvements on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks.

Conclusion: CAM effectively captures global dependencies efficiently, setting a new standard in learned image compression.

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

*Doanh Cao Bui,Jin Tae Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSFormer is a Transformer-based continual learning framework for efficient multi-task WSI analysis, avoiding full historical dataset revisits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for resource-efficient continual learning in WSI analysis due to large data sizes and growing clinical use.

Method: Introduces COSFormer, a framework for sequential learning from new tasks without retraining on old data.

Result: Outperforms existing continual learning frameworks on seven WSI datasets across six tasks.

Conclusion: COSFormer is a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

*Xin Dong,Yiwei Zhang,Yangjie Cui,Jinwu Xiang,Daochun Li,Zhan Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESI, a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction method, ensuring real-time performance and high frame rates for UAV visual tracking under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras excel in dynamic range and motion blur immunity but require efficient onboard implementation. ESI addresses this by enabling conventional vision methods to work with event cameras.

Method: ESI reconstructs intensity images via single integration of event streams and an enhanced decay algorithm, achieving real-time performance at 100 FPS.

Result: ESI outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in runtime efficiency, reconstruction quality, and frame rate, excelling in low-light UAV tracking.

Conclusion: ESI significantly enhances UAV onboard perception, proving effective in extreme low-light conditions where other algorithms fail.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

### [183] [Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Confidence-Gated Taylor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02240)
*Xiaoliu Guan,Lielin Jiang,Hanqi Chen,Xu Zhang,Jiaxing Yan,Guanzhong Wang,Yi Liu,Zetao Zhang,Yu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic Taylor-based acceleration method for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to improve inference speed without significant quality loss, addressing memory and computation overheads of prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free methods for accelerating DiTs suffer from memory and computation overhead due to fine-grained feature caching and fixed schedules, leading to degraded outputs when predictions fail.

Method: The approach shifts Taylor prediction to the last block level, reducing cached features, and introduces a dynamic caching mechanism based on prediction reliability (error in the first block).

Result: Achieves 3.17x, 2.36x, and 4.14x acceleration on FLUX, DiT, and Wan Video datasets with negligible quality drop.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances speed and quality, making DiTs more practical for low-resource applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

*Ziyan Liu,Junwen Li,Kaiwen Li,Tong Ruan,Chao Wang,Xinyan He,Zongyu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based framework, Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections, improves multimodal entity linking by prioritizing text and iteratively integrating visual clues when needed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multimodal entity linking, such as unnecessary image data use and one-time visual feature extraction, to enhance accuracy.

Method: Proposes a framework that prioritizes text, uses intra- and inter-modality evaluations, and employs multi-round iterative visual clue integration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances text and visual data, enhancing multimodal entity linking performance.

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

### [185] [Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Derivative Label Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02254)
*Yuanbin Fu,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DerProp introduces derivative label propagation to improve pseudo-label reliability in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of pseudo-labels in semi-supervised semantic segmentation and reduce annotation burden.

Method: Uses derivative label propagation with discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise features for regularization, constraining the solution space.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over other methods in experiments.

Conclusion: DerProp effectively enhances pseudo-label reliability and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

*Wenchuan Zhang,Jingru Guo,Hengzhe Zhang,Penghao Zhang,Jie Chen,Shuwan Zhang,Zhang Zhang,Yuhao Yi,Hong Bu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patho-AgenticRAG is a multimodal RAG framework for pathology, addressing hallucinations in VLMs by integrating text-image retrieval from textbooks, improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology VLMs face challenges like hallucinations due to high-resolution images and complex semantics, limiting trust. Existing RAG methods lack visual cue integration.

Method: Proposes Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with page-level embeddings from textbooks, enabling joint text-image search and reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing models in tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG enhances pathology VLMs by combining text-image retrieval and reasoning, improving clinical trust and accuracy.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

*Rui Qian,Haozhi Cao,Tianchen Deng,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSSC introduces depth-guided initialization and a Gaussian aggregator to improve monocular 3D semantic scene completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and artifacts from random initialization of Gaussian primitives in monocular 3D semantic scene completion.

Method: Uses a depth-guided initialization strategy with a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion module and a Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator for robust predictions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, with 9.3% reduction in latency and memory.

Conclusion: SplatSSC effectively resolves initialization and noise issues, advancing monocular 3D semantic scene completion.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Peng Zhang,Zhihui Lai,Heng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hermes, a semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for ultrasound image classification and segmentation, addressing issues like incorrect pseudo-labels and lack of task affinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from overly confident but incorrect pseudo-labels and fail to explore task affinity between segmentation and classification, degrading semi-supervised contrastive learning performance.

Method: Hermes combines contrastive and semi-supervised learning, using pseudo-labels for guidance. It includes an inter-task attention module and consistency learning to align features across tasks.

Result: Hermes outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public and private ultrasound datasets in various semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Hermes strategy effectively addresses pseudo-label inaccuracies and task affinity issues, demonstrating superior performance in ultrasound image tasks.

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

*Xiangzeng Liu,Chi Wang,Guanglu Shi,Xiaodong Zhang,Qiguang Miao,Miao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGAD introduces a novel area descriptor network for efficient and accurate local feature matching, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing A2PM methods are inefficient due to pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching, limiting scalability.

Method: SGAD uses discriminative area descriptors for direct matching, a novel supervision strategy for classification and ranking, and HCRF for eliminating overlapping areas.

Result: SGAD reduces runtime by 60x and improves accuracy, e.g., 65.98 vs. 61.11 in outdoor pose estimation.

Conclusion: SGAD sets a new state-of-the-art in local feature matching, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

*Paul Zaha,Lars Böcking,Simeon Allmendinger,Leopold Müller,Niklas Kühl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how edge-focused pre-training of foundation models impacts medical image segmentation across modalities, proposing a meta-learning strategy for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of edge preprocessing on segmentation performance and address the lack of systematic examination of edge cues in pre-training.

Method: Pre-train foundation models on raw or edge-enhanced data, fine-tune on modality-specific subsets, and introduce a meta-learning strategy based on image statistics.

Result: Edge-focused pre-training shows mixed results; meta-learning improves overall segmentation performance by 16.42% over edge-only and 19.30% over raw-only models.

Conclusion: Selective application of edge-focused pre-training via meta-learning enhances segmentation performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel stereo 3D object detection framework using only event cameras, addressing gaps in high-speed scenarios with a dual filter mechanism and improved bounding box alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of LiDAR and RGB cameras in high-speed scenarios by leveraging event cameras' asynchronous and high temporal resolution capabilities.

Method: Proposes a stereo 3D object detection framework using event cameras alone, with a dual filter mechanism for semantic and geometric information extraction and enhanced bounding box regression.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in dynamic environments, showcasing robust, continuous-time 3D perception.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of event cameras for reliable 3D object detection without conventional sensors, with code publicly available.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMet introduces a meta-learning strategy for deep anomaly detection, enabling training on uncurated datasets without manual filtering, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection assumes all training data are nominal, requiring manual curation and introducing bias. CoMet aims to eliminate this need and improve adaptability.

Method: CoMet combines Soft Confident Learning (weighting low-confidence samples less) and Meta-Learning (regularizing updates via training-validation loss covariance) to prevent overfitting and handle noisy data.

Result: Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 show CoMet outperforms baselines, remains robust to anomalies in training data, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: CoMet provides a model-agnostic, effective solution for training anomaly detection models on uncurated datasets, enhancing adaptability and performance.

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning method for whole-body preclinical disease risk assessment outperforms traditional radiomics in predicting multiple diseases and enhances CVD subgroup predictions when combined with cardiac MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preclinical disease risk assessment by moving beyond single-condition, hand-crafted feature approaches to a more comprehensive, proactive method.

Method: Whole-body self-supervised representation learning under competing risk modeling, tested in a preclinical screening scenario and combined with cardiac MRI for CVD subgroups.

Result: Outperforms whole-body radiomics in predicting CVD, T2D, COPD, and CKD; enhances CVD subgroup predictions (IHD, HD, stroke) when combined with cardiac MRI.

Conclusion: Demonstrates translational potential as a standalone screening tool or part of a multi-modal clinical workflow for early, personalized risk stratification.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

### [194] [Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02319)
*Anna M. Wundram,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI in healthcare requires human-AI collaboration for safety. Uncertainty quantification methods may outperform learned deferral models in handling out-of-distribution data, as shown in a glaucoma classification study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe AI implementation in patient care by improving models' ability to defer decisions to humans when uncertain, especially under data shift.

Method: Evaluated learned deferral models and uncertainty quantification methods on a large ophthalmology dataset, testing their performance in- and out-of-distribution for glaucoma classification.

Result: Uncertainty quantification methods showed promise as a deferral strategy, being more robust to out-of-distribution inputs than learned deferral models.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification methods are a viable alternative for AI deferral, particularly in handling unpredictable data shifts.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

### [195] [Zero-shot Compositional Action Recognition with Neural Logic Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02320)
*Gefan Ye,Lin Li,Kexin Li,Jun Xiao,Long chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogicCAR introduces dual symbolic constraints (compositional and hierarchical logic) to improve zero-shot compositional action recognition, outperforming baselines on Sth-com dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses spurious correlations and semantic ambiguity in ZS-CAR by leveraging human-like symbolic reasoning.

Method: Proposes LogicCAR with Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic, formalized in first-order logic and embedded into neural networks.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on Sth-com dataset.

Conclusion: LogicCAR effectively bridges symbolic abstraction with neural models, enhancing compositional reasoning and semantic hierarchy in ZS-CAR.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

*Philipp Wulff,Felix Wimbauer,Dominik Muhle,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for single-image volumetric scene reconstruction using pre-trained 2D diffusion and depth prediction models, outperforming multi-view supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image without requiring expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate synthetic scene geometry, which is used to train a feed-forward reconstruction model.

Result: Matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, especially in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective and effective alternative to multi-view supervision for volumetric scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Qwen-Image is an advanced image generation model with strong text rendering and editing capabilities, using a progressive training strategy and dual-encoding for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve complex text rendering and precise image editing in foundation models.

Method: Uses a comprehensive data pipeline, progressive training, and a dual-encoding mechanism for semantic and reconstructive representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in text rendering (including logographic languages) and image editing.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image excels in image generation and editing, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-IN enhances CLIP's fine-grained perception using instruction-editing datasets and long captions, improving performance on detailed tasks without losing zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of VLMs like CLIP in fine-grained visual comprehension.

Method: Uses instruction-editing datasets for hard negative pairs and long captions with rotary positional encodings.

Result: Achieves gains on MMVP and fine-grained tasks, reduces hallucinations in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Targeted contrastive learning and descriptive information improve VLM fine-grained understanding.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

### [199] [Correspondence-Free Fast and Robust Spherical Point Pattern Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02339)
*Anik Sarker,Alan T. Asbeck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a linear-time algorithm for rotation estimation between spherical patterns, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spherical pattern rotation estimation are computationally expensive (O(n^3)) and lack robustness to outliers.

Method: Represents spherical patterns as 3D point sets, reformulating rotation estimation as a Wahba problem. Introduces three algorithms: SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid approach.

Result: Algorithms are 10x faster and 10x more accurate than state-of-the-art methods in correspondence-free settings. Validated on a new dataset and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves efficiency and accuracy for spherical pattern rotation estimation, with practical applications in PCR and spherical image processing.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

### [200] [Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02340)
*Fan Hu,Zijie Xin,Xirong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LPD (Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces) for Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) to address visual diversity challenges by diversifying feature spaces and using de-correlation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The visual diversity in AVS makes it hard to retrieve relevant videos comprehensively. Current methods fuse features into common spaces but lack diversity.

Method: LPD constructs feature-specific common spaces and uses de-correlation loss to diversify negative sample ordering. It also includes an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss.

Result: Experiments on TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) show LPD's effectiveness. Visualizations confirm its ability to enhance result diversity.

Conclusion: LPD successfully addresses AVS challenges by leveraging diverse feature spaces and de-correlation, improving retrieval performance and diversity.

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines radar and camera data to localize pedestrians in NLoS urban environments, overcoming limitations of each sensor alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian localization in NLoS regions is challenging for autonomous driving due to radar distortions and camera limitations.

Method: The framework interprets 2D radar PCD using road layout inferred from camera data for spatial scene reconstruction.

Result: Experiments with a real vehicle-mounted system validate the method's effectiveness in outdoor NLoS environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates practical applicability for NLoS pedestrian localization by fusing radar and camera data.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text2Lip introduces a viseme-centric framework for generating talking faces using textual input, overcoming challenges of audio-driven methods with a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy and landmark-guided rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability and robustness issues in audio-driven talking face generation due to reliance on paired audio-visual data and ambiguous acoustic-lip mapping.

Method: Uses structured viseme sequences as a phonetic-visual bridge, employs a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy, and synthesizes videos with a landmark-guided renderer.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality robustness.

Conclusion: Text2Lip establishes a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking face generation.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

TL;DR: OTIP leverages optimal transport theory for image inversion in rectified flow models, balancing reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving optimal balance between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility in image inversion is a challenge.

Method: Uses optimal transport theory to guide inversion, computing transport paths between image and noise distributions.

Result: High-fidelity reconstruction (LPIPS 0.001, SSIM 0.992) and improved editing performance (7.8%-12.9% better than baselines).

Conclusion: OTIP offers superior reconstruction and editing, maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces the TRUDI dataset and TITUS pipeline for identifying transportation units (TUs) in diverse port environments, addressing the lack of benchmark datasets and improving logistics efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available benchmark datasets capturing real-world port diversity hinders progress in TU identification, impacting logistics efficiency.

Method: The TRUDI dataset includes 35,034 annotated instances across five categories. The TITUS pipeline segments TUs, detects ID text locations, and recognizes/validates IDs under varied conditions.

Result: TITUS reliably identifies TUs from diverse camera perspectives and conditions, outperforming systems requiring specific setups.

Conclusion: The TRUDI dataset and TITUS pipeline provide a robust benchmark for TU identification, supporting digital transformation and logistics efficiency.

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

TL;DR: Uni-Layout is a unified framework for layout generation and evaluation, incorporating human feedback and dynamic optimization to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation approaches are task-specific and use misaligned metrics, limiting applicability and effectiveness.

Method: Uni-Layout integrates a unified generator, a human-mimicking evaluator (using Layout-HF100k dataset), and Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization for alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show Uni-Layout outperforms task-specific and general-purpose methods.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout offers a cohesive, human-aligned solution for layout generation and evaluation, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime surveillance is challenging due to multi-scale targets and dynamic environments. Existing datasets lack spatiotemporal consistency and multi-modal alignment.

Method: The SMART-Ship dataset includes 1092 multi-modal image sets (38,838 ships) with fine-grained annotations (polygons, categories, IDs, change masks). Images are spatiotemporally registered and acquired within one week.

Result: The dataset supports five fundamental tasks, with experiments validating its utility for multi-modal remote sensing interpretation.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship bridges a critical gap in maritime surveillance, offering a robust dataset for multi-modal RS tasks and highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

TL;DR: COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model for instance segmentation and object detection, using CutOnce for pseudo labels and self-training for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance unsupervised object localization by simplifying the process of generating pseudo labels and learning from them without relying on clustering or complex loss functions.

Method: Uses CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels via Normalized Cut, then trains a detector with these masks. Includes modules to leverage self-supervised models and avoid post-processing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks without needing specialized loss functions.

Conclusion: COLER is a promising approach for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection, with potential to advance the field.

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hydra integrates mm-Wave radar and camera tech to detect leaf wetness, achieving high accuracy (96%) in varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LWD detection lacks standardization and robustness, limiting real-world agricultural applications.

Method: Combines CNN for feature fusion and transformer-based encoder for feature mapping, using FMCW radar (76-81 GHz).

Result: 96% accuracy in controlled settings, ~90% in challenging farm conditions (rain, low light).

Conclusion: Hydra offers a precise, resilient solution for LWD detection, bridging the gap in agricultural disease management.

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Conclusion: HGTS-Former successfully models multivariate coupling in time series, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

### [210] [Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419)
*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination due to modality bias, ignoring both visual and textual cues. A training-free method adjusts attention weights and uses contrastive decoding to mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked issue of modality bias in LVLMs, where models ignore both visual and textual information during hallucination.

Method: Propose a training-free method to balance cross-modal attention weights and use contrastive decoding to reduce reliance on parametric knowledge.

Result: Experiments show widespread modality bias in LVLMs, and the method effectively reduces hallucination across models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method is simple, effective, and generalizable, improving LVLM alignment with user intentions.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

*Yin Lin,iccardo Barbieri,Domenico Aquino,Giuseppe Lauria,Marina Grisoli,Elena De Momi,Alberto Redaelli,Simona Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI approach using Vision Transformers (ViTs) predicts glioblastoma survival from MRI images without tumor segmentation, achieving 62.5% accuracy on BRATS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting Overall Survival (OS) for glioblastoma patients is crucial for personalized treatment and clinical decisions.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract features directly from MRI images, bypassing tumor segmentation.

Result: Achieved 62.5% accuracy on BRATS dataset, with balanced precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Conclusion: ViTs show promise for efficient OS prediction in medical imaging, though dataset size limits generalization.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoSyncNet improves lip-reading accuracy by dynamically adjusting focus and using tailored data augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRW and LRW1000 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lip-reading from silent videos is essential for Assistive Technology and Augmented Reality, but variability in sequences and uneven information distribution make it challenging.

Method: InfoSyncNet uses a non-uniform quantization module between encoder and decoder, along with tailored data augmentation and training strategies for handling visual speech inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves 92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 accuracy on LRW and LRW1000 datasets, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet effectively addresses challenges in lip-reading, demonstrating superior performance and potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

### [213] [SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02464)
*Yonghuang Wu,Wenwen Zeng,Xuan Xie,Chengqian Zhao,Guoqing Wu,Jinhua Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO bridges the intent gap in SAM by optimizing for high-level categorical intent from sparse prompts, achieving superior performance in dense object segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of SAM in segmenting only explicitly prompted objects, particularly in domains with dense homogeneous objects like biomedical nuclei segmentation.

Method: Introduces SAMPO, a framework using preference optimization to implicitly capture target-class characteristics without language models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines by over 9 percentage points on tasks like PanNuke-T2 with only 10% training data.

Conclusion: SAMPO establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, eliminating dependencies on auxiliary tools.

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

### [214] [Multi-class Image Anomaly Detection for Practical Applications: Requirements and Robust Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02477)
*Jaehyuk Heo,Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a framework for multi-class image anomaly detection, addressing performance gaps and class information usage. It validates HierCore's robustness across scenarios with or without class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-class anomaly detection by addressing underperformance of single models compared to class-specific ones and exploring the impact of class information on detection thresholds.

Method: Proposes HierCore, a hierarchical memory bank-based framework, to estimate class-wise decision criteria without needing class labels.

Result: HierCore consistently meets requirements and performs robustly across all tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HierCore is a practical solution for real-world multi-class anomaly detection, adaptable to varying label availability.

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

*Xinquan Yu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation, addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating modality reliability, unimodal internal, and cross-modal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting multi-modal media manipulation suffer from unreliable unimodal data and lack comprehensive forgery supervision, limiting performance.

Method: The FMS network includes three modules: Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) for modality reliability, Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) for internal supervision, and Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) for cross-modal supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show FMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation.

Conclusion: The FMS network effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing comprehensive supervision, leading to superior performance in multi-modal forgery detection.

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction, addressing signal mixing, temporal resolution mismatch, and dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding visual cognition and enabling brain-computer interfaces require reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI, but current methods are limited to single-shot clips.

Method: Proposes a shot boundary predictor, generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, and large-scale data synthesis to decompose fMRI signals and decode robust textual descriptions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity, with fMRI decomposition improving caption similarity by 71.8%.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through decomposition and semantic prompting.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

*Jianchao Wang,Peng Zhou,Cen Li,Rong Quan,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EFA-GS reduces floating artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting by expanding under-optimized Gaussians and using depth/scale strategies, improving PSNR by 1.68 dB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating artifacts in 3DGS degrade visual fidelity, especially with low-quality initialization. Their origins and solutions are underexplored.

Method: Analyzes artifacts in frequency domain, proposes EFA-GS to expand under-optimized Gaussians, and uses depth/scale strategies for refinement.

Result: EFA-GS reduces artifacts, preserves details, and improves PSNR by 1.68 dB on RWLQ dataset. Effective in 3D editing tasks.

Conclusion: EFA-GS effectively mitigates floating artifacts while maintaining detail, validated by experiments and downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

### [218] [Rethinking Transparent Object Grasping: Depth Completion with Monocular Depth Estimation and Instance Mask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02507)
*Yaofeng Cheng,Xinkai Gao,Sen Zhang,Chao Zeng,Fusheng Zha,Lining Sun,Chenguang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMake improves depth completion for transparent objects by using instance masks and monocular depth estimation, enhancing accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth cameras struggle with transparent objects, leading to incomplete data and unreliable robotic grasping. Existing methods fail to generalize to real-world scenarios due to complex light interactions.

Method: ReMake uses instance masks to identify transparent regions and monocular depth estimation for context, focusing learning on accurate depth estimation in these areas.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios, showing superior accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: ReMake effectively addresses depth completion challenges for transparent objects, improving robotic grasping reliability.

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

TL;DR: The paper explores large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction, comparing VideoLLaMA2 (audio, visual, language) and Qwen2.5-VL (visual, language). VideoLLaMA2 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, emphasizing audio's role. Their ensemble method wins the ICCV VQualA 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video engagement prediction is crucial for recommendation systems and content creation but is complex due to multimodal interactions. Existing methods struggle with cross-feature and cross-modality modeling.

Method: Adopts VideoLLaMA2 (audio, visual, language) and Qwen2.5-VL (visual, language) trained on SnapUGC dataset. Evaluates their performance and ensembles them.

Result: Both models perform competitively; VideoLLaMA2 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, showing audio's importance. The ensemble method wins the ICCV challenge.

Conclusion: LMMs are effective for engagement prediction, with audio features playing a key role. The ensemble approach achieves top performance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

### [220] [Understanding the Risks of Asphalt Art on the Reliability of Surveillance Perception Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02530)
*Jin Ma,Abyad Enan,Long Cheng,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Artistic crosswalks can degrade pedestrian detection in vision-based systems, especially with complex or adversarial designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how asphalt art affects pedestrian detection in surveillance systems, considering both normal and adversarial cases.

Method: Constructed realistic crosswalk scenarios with various asphalt art patterns and evaluated a pretrained model's pedestrian detection performance.

Result: Complex artistic patterns degrade detection, and adversarial designs can obscure or fake pedestrians.

Conclusion: Urban surveillance systems must account for visual variations to ensure robust pedestrian detection.

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC dynamically adjusts video compression based on weather/lighting to balance bandwidth and detection accuracy in ITS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited bandwidth in ITS can hinder real-time performance, and fixed compression degrades detection accuracy under varying conditions.

Method: Uses PAVC framework to dynamically adjust compression levels based on environmental factors, optimizing bandwidth and detection accuracy.

Result: Improves vehicle detection accuracy by 13% and reduces bandwidth by 8.23x (moderate) or 72x (severe).

Conclusion: PAVC effectively balances bandwidth efficiency and detection accuracy in ITS under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

TL;DR: MonoDream is a lightweight Vision-Language Action (VLA) framework that improves monocular navigation by learning a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR), narrowing the performance gap with panoramic-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of costly or inaccessible panoramic RGB-D sensors in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks by enhancing monocular input performance.

Method: Introduces a shared feature representation (UNR) aligning visual semantics and action intent, and Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to predict panoramic features from monocular input.

Result: MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly reduces the gap with panoramic-based agents on VLN benchmarks.

Conclusion: MonoDream demonstrates the feasibility of achieving competitive navigation performance with monocular input, offering a practical alternative to panoramic sensors.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMoMask is a unified framework for text-to-motion generation, addressing limitations in diversity, physical plausibility, and retrieval-augmented generation. It introduces innovations like bidirectional momentum, semantic spatio-temporal attention, and RAG-classifier-free guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion methods struggle with diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility in generative models, and issues like diffusion inertia and asynchronous artifacts in retrieval-augmented methods.

Method: ReMoMask integrates three innovations: 1) Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model for improved retrieval precision, 2) Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention for biomechanical constraints, and 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance for better generalization.

Result: ReMoMask outperforms previous methods, achieving 3.88% and 10.97% improvements in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReMoMask sets a new standard for text-to-motion generation by combining retrieval and generative approaches effectively, with demonstrated superior performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially

### [224] [Evaluating Variance in Visual Question Answering Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02645)
*Nikitha SR*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines performance variance in MLLMs for VQA, analyzing factors like training seed and hyperparameters, and proposes Cloze-style evaluation for more reliable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks overlooks performance variance caused by stochastic outputs, training seeds, and hyperparameters, limiting robust development.

Method: Analyzes variance across 14 VQA benchmarks, studying impacts of training seed, non-determinism, model scale, and finetuning. Explores Cloze-style evaluation as an alternative.

Result: Identifies significant performance variability and highlights limitations of current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: Advocates for variance-aware methodologies to improve reliability and robustness in MLLM development.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

### [225] [PMGS: Reconstruction of Projectile Motion across Large Spatiotemporal Spans via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02660)
*Yijun Xu,Jingrui Zhang,Yuhan Chen,Dingwen Wang,Lei Yu,Chu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMGS reconstructs projectile motion using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing challenges in dynamic reconstruction with a two-stage workflow and novel constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model long-term, large-scale rigid motion with physical consistency, limiting dynamic reconstruction accuracy.

Method: PMGS uses a two-stage approach: 1) Target Modeling for object-centralized reconstruction, and 2) Motion Recovery via SE(3) pose learning. It incorporates acceleration consistency and dynamic simulated annealing.

Result: PMGS outperforms mainstream methods in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion.

Conclusion: PMGS effectively addresses unresolved challenges in dynamic reconstruction, offering improved accuracy and physical consistency.

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

### [226] [MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02669)
*Xiaoke Huang,Juncheng Wu,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVLThinker introduces open, reproducible baselines for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs, with RLVR outperforming SFT and text-only data proving more effective than multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of open and reproducible methods for medical reasoning models hinders community research and comparison.

Method: Systematic data curation (text-only and image-text) and two training paradigms: SFT and RLVR.

Result: RLVR consistently outperforms SFT; text-only data boosts performance more than multimodal data. A 7B model achieves SOTA on VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedVLThinker provides a strong open foundation for future medical reasoning research, with models scaling competitively to proprietary counterparts.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

### [227] [Raw Data Matters: Enhancing Prompt Tuning by Internal Augmentation on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02671)
*Haoyang Li,Liang Wang,Chao Wang,Siyu Zhou,Jing Jiang,Yan Peng,Guodong Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AugPT introduces a self-contained, distillation-based prompt tuning method using internal augmentation to enhance CLIP-based models without external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on costly external knowledge and ignore image modality features. AugPT aims to better exploit known features using internal augmentation.

Method: AugPT uses self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images and a gating mechanism to filter noisy samples, reusing the pre-trained model backbone.

Result: Extensive experiments show AugPT improves performance and generalization without external knowledge.

Conclusion: AugPT is an effective, cost-efficient alternative to external knowledge-based methods for prompt tuning.

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

### [228] [ReCoSeg++:Extended Residual-Guided Cross-Modal Diffusion for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01058)
*Sara Yavari,Rahul Nitin Pandya,Jacob Furst*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A two-stage, semi-supervised framework for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans, using cross-modal synthesis and residual-guided enhancement, achieves improved accuracy on the BraTS 2021 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, but ground-truth masks are often unavailable.

Method: A residual-guided DDPM synthesizes T1ce from other modalities, and a lightweight U-Net uses residual maps for segmentation. Slice-level filtering and optimized thresholding address dataset variability.

Result: Achieves Dice score of 93.02% and IoU of 86.7% on BraTS 2021, outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline.

Conclusion: The method improves accuracy and scalability for real-world, multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

### [229] [Mobile U-ViT: Revisiting large kernel and U-shaped ViT for efficient medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01064)
*Fenghe Tang,Bingkun Nian,Jianrui Ding,Wenxin Ma,Quan Quan,Chengqi Dong,Jie Yang,Wei Liu,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Mobile U-ViT is a lightweight, efficient model for medical image segmentation, combining transformer-like representation with CNN efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile models optimized for natural images perform poorly on medical tasks due to domain differences. A lightweight, high-performing solution is needed.

Method: Uses ConvUtr for hierarchical patch embedding, LGL block for local-global exchange, and a shallow transformer bottleneck with a cascaded decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight 2D/3D datasets, including zero-shot testing on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT is an efficient, powerful, and generalizable solution for mobile medical image analysis.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.
