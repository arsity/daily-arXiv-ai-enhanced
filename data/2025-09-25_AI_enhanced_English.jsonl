An essential yet\nchallenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures\naccurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse\norientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism.
