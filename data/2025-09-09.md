### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++ improves upon standard label smoothing by preserving inter-class relationships while reducing overconfidence in neural network predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard label smoothing addresses overconfidence and overfitting from one-hot labels but destroys inter-class relationships by assigning equal importance to all non-target classes.

Method: Proposes Label Smoothing++ which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes while accounting for their inter-class relationships, using fixed target labels and learning non-target labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while promoting inter-class relationships and improving generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++ provides an effective regularization strategy that maintains class relationships while reducing overconfidence, outperforming standard label smoothing.

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD is a visual interactive labeling tool that combines visual analytics with human-in-the-loop active learning to make object detection annotation more transparent and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning for object detection lacks transparency and limits human expert insight, while manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive.

Method: Developed VILOD tool with t-SNE projections, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views to enable interactive human-AI collaboration in sample selection for object detection.

Result: VILOD facilitated distinct labeling strategies and achieved competitive object detection performance compared to automated uncertainty sampling baseline.

Conclusion: VILOD makes human-in-the-loop active learning workflows more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective for object detection annotation.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) with dynamic balancing factor alpha instead of fixed hyperparameter, using student-teacher discrepancy and context-aware module to improve knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD uses fixed alpha hyperparameter to balance hard-label and soft-label losses, but static alpha is suboptimal as optimal trade-off varies during training.

Method: 1) Make alpha learnable parameter; 2) Use formula based on student-teacher discrepancy to compute alpha dynamically; 3) Introduce Context-Aware Module (MLP + Attention) to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-50 teacher, ResNet-18 student) show superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines and more stable convergence.

Conclusion: Adaptive balancing of hard and soft supervision through learnable alpha and context-aware reweighting improves knowledge distillation performance and training stability.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion
analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study compares three edge-centric network measures (FRC, ORC, EBC) for pruning randomly wired neural networks in COVID-19 chest x-ray classification, finding FRC offers computational efficiency with comparable performance to ORC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different network connectivity patterns impact learning efficiency and model performance, and to explore edge-centric network measures for pruning and optimization in randomly wired neural networks.

Method: Used three edge-centric measures (Forman-Ricci curvature, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, edge betweenness centrality) to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses. Applied to three network generators (ER, WS, BA models) for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification.

Result: FRC-based pruning effectively simplifies RWNNs with significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC. Structural analysis showed trade-offs between modular segregation and network efficiency.

Conclusion: Forman-Ricci curvature provides a computationally efficient alternative to Ollivier-Ricci curvature for network pruning, achieving comparable effectiveness while offering substantial computational benefits.

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

*Juan Carlos Martinez-Sevilla,Francesco Foscarin,Patricia Garcia-Iasci,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dataset and OMR model for handwritten jazz lead sheets, addressing challenges of chord recognition and handwritten variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OMR systems cannot handle chords in handwritten jazz lead sheets, and handwritten images present high variability and quality issues that need specialized solutions.

Method: Created a dataset of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets with ground truth scores, generated synthetic score images, and developed a specialized OMR model with specific tokenization for jazz data using pretrained models.

Result: Produced a comprehensive dataset with 2021 aligned staves and synthetic images, along with a functional OMR model specifically designed for jazz lead sheet recognition.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in OMR for handwritten jazz scores by providing both a valuable dataset and a specialized model, with all code, data, and models publicly released for further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM framework uses synthetic data with 4 types of annotations and a two-stage self-correcting inference process to improve object recognition robustness against domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern object recognition models suffer severe accuracy drops when exposed to domain shifts including image statistics variations, pose/viewpoint changes, occlusion, and visual confusion between classes.

Method: Create synthetic dataset with 4-clue annotations (bounding boxes, class names, object captions, scene captions), fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct, and use two-stage inference with self-critique loop.

Result: RT-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines across robustness benchmarks isolating individual domain shifts.

Conclusion: Structured multimodal evidence combined with explicit self-critique loops provides a promising approach for reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

*Diwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based system using YOLOv5 and Kalman filter to measure badminton smash speed cost-effectively, making performance analytics accessible to amateur players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports performance measurement technology is expensive and inaccessible to amateur/recreational players, creating a need for affordable solutions.

Method: Uses custom-trained YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, Kalman filter for trajectory tracking, and video-based kinematic speed estimation with spatiotemporal scaling.

Result: Developed an intuitive mobile application that automatically calculates shuttlecock velocity from standard video recordings.

Conclusion: The system democratizes access to high-level performance analytics, empowering players at all levels to analyze and improve their game through accessible smartphone technology.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [9] [A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335)
*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Built large-scale Chinese handwriting database and enhanced OpenHandWrite_Toolbox to study linguistic components' effects on handwriting at character, radical, and stroke levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how phonological, semantic, and orthographic systems modulate Chinese handwriting at different levels (character, radical, stroke) and address the lack of comprehensive tools for capturing fine-grained handwriting data.

Method: Constructed database with 42 Chinese speakers handwriting 1200 characters in dictation task. Enhanced OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for experimental design modification, stroke-level trajectory capture, and batch-processing of handwriting measurements (latency, duration, pen-pressure). Used multiple regression analysis.

Result: Orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and execution across all three levels. Phonological factors influence execution at all levels. Lexical effects show hierarchical attenuation - strongest at character level, followed by radical, weakest at stroke levels.

Conclusion: Handwriting preparation and execution at radical and stroke levels are closely linked to linguistic components. The database and toolbox provide valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on handwriting across languages.

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

### [10] [Anticipatory Fall Detection in Humans with Hybrid Directed Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05337)
*Younggeol Cho,Gokhan Solak,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lorenzini,Andrea Fortuna,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid DGNN-LSTM model for early fall prediction by decoupling motion prediction and gait classification, achieving superior accuracy in detecting stable, transient, and fall states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fall detection systems focus on detecting falls after they occur, but predicting falls before they happen and analyzing the transient state between stability and falling remains unexplored, which is critical for effective assistive robotics.

Method: Proposes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) for gait classification (stable/transient/fall states) with LSTM networks for motion prediction. Uses real-time skeletal features from video sequences as input and decouples prediction and classification tasks.

Result: Trained and validated on OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets, demonstrating superior performance in prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to DGNN-only models and existing literature. Decoupling prediction and classification improved performance over unified approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid DGNN-LSTM approach effectively anticipates falls with high accuracy and enables monitoring of the transient state, providing valuable insights for enhancing advanced assistance systems in assistive robotics.

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

### [11] [Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340)
*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of K-Means (hard clustering) vs Fuzzy C-Means (soft clustering) for brain tumor segmentation in MRI. K-Means is faster (0.3s/image) but less accurate (DSC 0.43), while FCM is slower (1.3s/image) but more accurate (DSC 0.67).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and disease monitoring, but challenging due to tumor heterogeneity.

Method: Comparative analysis using BraTS2020 dataset with Gaussian filtering and CLAHE pre-processing. Evaluated K-Means (hard clustering) vs Fuzzy C-Means (soft clustering) using Dice Similarity Coefficient and processing time metrics.

Result: K-Means achieved faster processing (0.3s per image) but lower accuracy (DSC 0.43). FCM achieved higher accuracy (DSC 0.67) but slower processing (1.3s per image).

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between computational efficiency (K-Means) and segmentation accuracy (FCM) in brain tumor segmentation, with FCM providing better boundary precision at higher computational cost.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pest and disease classification methods are limited to binary classification, which restricts practical applications where identifying specific disease/pest types is essential for precision agriculture.

Method: Enhanced pre-trained CNN model with attention-based modules and comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to address class imbalance issues.

Result: Achieved 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image dataset, outperforming other approaches using the same datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed robust deep learning model provides effective multi-class classification for onion crop diseases and pests, enabling better precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

### [13] [Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342)
*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF is an inversion-free text-to-image editing framework that uses velocity field discrepancy modeling and time-dependent shifts to improve editing quality while avoiding over-smoothing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-smoothing artifacts in prior distillation sampling approaches for text-to-image editing and provide a unified theoretical framework that bridges score-based diffusion and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization.

Method: Distillation-based approach that explicitly models the discrepancy between source and target velocity fields, introduces a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to target trajectory, and requires no architectural modifications.

Result: Achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability compared to previous methods while maintaining efficiency and broad applicability to text-to-image editing tasks.

Conclusion: DVRF provides a principled theoretical interpretation that generalizes existing methods like FlowEdit and demonstrates practical effectiveness in text-to-image editing with improved quality and no architectural changes required.

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

### [14] [Systematic Integration of Attention Modules into CNNs for Accurate and Generalizable Medical Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05343)
*Zahid Ullah,Minki Hong,Tahir Mahmood,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention mechanisms integrated into CNN architectures significantly improve medical image classification performance and feature localization across diverse imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs often fail to capture fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate medical diagnosis, necessitating enhanced attention to salient regions.

Method: Systematically integrated attention mechanisms (Squeeze and Excitation blocks and hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Modules) into five CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB5) and evaluated on brain tumor MRI and histopathological datasets.

Result: Attention-augmented CNNs consistently outperformed baseline architectures across all metrics, with EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieving the highest overall performance and substantial gains on both datasets.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms enhance both classification accuracy and feature localization, providing a systematic framework for developing robust and interpretable deep learning systems for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection

*Cuong Manh Hoang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised instance segmentation framework that eliminates the need for human annotations by using MultiCut algorithm, mask filtering, superpixel-guided mask loss, and adaptive self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotations for instance segmentation are costly to collect, creating a need for efficient self-supervised methods that can achieve high performance without manual labeling.

Method: Uses MultiCut algorithm on self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation, followed by mask filtering. Employs superpixel-guided mask loss (hard and soft loss) with coarse masks and superpixels from low-level features. Includes self-training with adaptive loss to improve mask quality.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on public datasets for both instance segmentation and object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively segments objects without human annotations, demonstrating superior performance through its novel combination of self-supervised techniques and adaptive training processes.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Juan Olalla-Pombo,Alberto Badías,Miguel Ángel Sanz-Gómez,José María Benítez,Francisco Javier Montáns*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new neural network approach combining Structure Preserving Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks to predict cell migration trajectories and mitosis events with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell biomechanics involve complex phenomena fundamental to life processes, but many interactions between cells and environmental factors remain unclear despite increasing research.

Method: Combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks (for mechanical cell movement analysis) with Artificial Neural Networks (for environmental factors from Computer Vision), plus a separate mitosis prediction model using Neural Networks.

Result: The model predicts complete cell trajectories with high accuracy in both simulated and real cell migration cases, and successfully predicts mitosis events.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively integrates mechanical and environmental factors to provide accurate predictions of cell migration and division events.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: EMCAD provides a computationally efficient solution for brain tumor segmentation with moderate performance, maintaining stability without overfitting, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical
image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from
healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An
efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor
segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.
However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs.
To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional
attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and
computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset

obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a
stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training
process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance

*Tejaswini Medi,Hsien-Yi Wang,Arianna Rampini,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FA-VAE, a wavelet-based frequency-aware VAE that explicitly decouples low and high-frequency optimization to improve texture reconstruction in latent generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent tokenizers prioritize low-frequency reconstruction at the expense of high-frequency fidelity, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts in textured regions.

Method: Wavelet-based frequency-aware variational autoencoder framework that explicitly decouples optimization of low- and high-frequency components using frequency decomposition analysis.

Result: Improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure, bridging the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware optimization is crucial for realistic image representation, with applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks face deployment limitations due to computational and memory overhead, requiring efficient compression methods for edge and mobile platforms.

Method: Computes differential sensitivity scores by fusing discrepancies among gradient-based sensitivity, first-order Taylor expansion, and KL divergence of activation distributions, with exponential scaling to identify unstable filters.

Result: Achieves over 80% FLOPs reduction while maintaining up to 98.23% of baseline accuracy at 70% pruning rate, outperforming traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and deterministic single-shot pruning solution that enables scalable DCNN compression for practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,José R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of layer-freezing strategies for YOLOv8/v10 in UAV applications shows no universal optimal approach - effectiveness depends on data properties, with up to 28% GPU memory savings and sometimes better performance than full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying YOLO architectures in resource-constrained UAV environments requires efficient transfer learning, but the impact of different freezing configurations on modern YOLO versions remains unexplored.

Method: Systematic investigation of multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four challenging infrastructure monitoring datasets, with gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM).

Result: Freezing backbone preserves general-purpose features while shallower freeze handles extreme class imbalance better. Achieves up to 28% GPU memory reduction and sometimes surpasses full fine-tuning mAP@50 scores. Gradient analysis shows distinct convergence patterns.

Conclusion: Provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies, offering evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and practical quaternion neural network framework that preserves geometric properties while enabling practical implementation, particularly for rotation-aware perception in resource-constrained systems.

Method: Uses Hamilton product decomposition to approximate quaternion convolution with real-valued operations, implements custom CUDA kernels for efficiency, introduces Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability, and extends quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence in image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling in object detection (COCO, DOTA), and establishes SOTA for quaternion CNNs in detection tasks.

Conclusion: QUAN demonstrates strong potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and shows applicability across various domains with improved efficiency and performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA introduces visibility-aware language aggregation and streaming weighted geometric median to address background noise and multi-view inconsistencies in distilling 2D language features into 3D Gaussians, achieving superior open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D Gaussians suffer from two key issues: background Gaussians getting the same features as foreground ones despite negligible contributions, and multi-view inconsistencies caused by view-specific noise in language embeddings.

Method: Proposes Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA) which computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Also introduces a streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features.

Result: VALA yields robust, view-consistent language feature embeddings in a fast and memory-efficient manner. It improves open-vocabulary localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently surpassing existing works.

Conclusion: The proposed VALA method effectively addresses background noise and multi-view inconsistency problems in 3D language feature distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view

TL;DR: Proposes DuoCLR framework using contrastive learning with novel 'Shuffle and Warp' augmentation and two surrogate tasks (CPC and ROR) for improved human action segmentation from skeleton data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous representation learning works focus on action recognition with isolated sequence-wise representations, lacking multi-scale representations and cross-sequence variations needed for action segmentation.

Method: Uses contrastive learning with 'Shuffle and Warp' data augmentation. Introduces two surrogate tasks: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) for intra-class similarity and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR) for inter-class context. Pre-trains on trimmed skeleton sequences.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance boost over state-of-the-art methods in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks on untrimmed datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DuoCLR framework effectively learns multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation through dual-surrogate contrastive learning and novel augmentation strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RED network uses robust event masking and disentangled attention to handle incomplete event streams for superior motion deblurring performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high-temporal-resolution motion data but suffer from incomplete event streams due to sensitivity-noise tradeoffs in DVS thresholding, which compromises motion priors and limits deblurring effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with: 1) Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) using random event masking, 2) disentangled OmniAttention modeling intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations, 3) interactive modules to enhance motion-sensitive areas and inject semantic context.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed RED network effectively addresses event stream incompleteness through robust masking strategies and disentangled representation learning, demonstrating superior deblurring performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods require iterative parameter updates that incur high computational complexity, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios.

Method: Parameter sensitivity analysis to prioritize quantization of high-sensitivity parameters, column-wise clustering of sensitivity, and row-parallel quantization framework with globally shared inverse Hessian matrix update mechanism.

Result: 20-200x quantization speedup over Optimal Brain Quantization baseline on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s, with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in model quantization, making it suitable for edge computing and real-time applications.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Achieves 90 FPS at 512x512 resolution, follows scaling law for improved performance with larger reconstruction modules, and maintains driving efficiency through separation design.

Conclusion: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating effective single-image 3D avatar generation with real-time performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Current Deepfake detection methods are limited by datasets lacking diversity needed for real-world scenarios, particularly in unknown forgery techniques, facial scene variability, real data richness, and real-world degradation.

Method: Proposed Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image (MFFI) dataset with four strategic dimensions: wider forgery methods, varied facial scenes, diversified authentic data, and multi-level degradation operations.

Result: MFFI contains 50 different forgery methods and 1024K image samples, outperforming existing datasets in scene complexity, cross-domain generalization, and detection difficulty gradients.

Conclusion: MFFI dataset provides technical advancement and practical utility for simulating real-world Deepfake detection conditions, with publicly available dataset and details.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

### [31] [Language-guided Recursive Spatiotemporal Graph Modeling for Video Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05604)
*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph proposes a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling approach for video summarization that uses recursive graph networks to model object and frame relationships with semantic language guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video summarization methods focused on temporal modeling but ignored fine-grained visual entities like objects. Language-guided summarization requires better semantic understanding of complex videos and how objects relate to each other.

Method: Recursive spatiotemporal graph networks that formulate objects and frames as nodes in spatial and temporal graphs. Uses language queries to incorporate semantic knowledge into node representations and prevent visual similarity-based connections. Employs recursive strategy to refine graphs and classify keyframes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for both generic and query-focused video summarization in supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: VideoGraph effectively addresses video summarization by modeling semantic relationships between objects and frames using language-guided spatiotemporal graphs, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

### [32] [Patch-level Kernel Alignment for Self-Supervised Dense Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05606)
*Juan Yeo,Ijun Jang,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) framework for self-supervised dense representation learning that transfers semantic knowledge from pretrained models to dense feature space through distribution alignment between teacher and student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods focus on global image representations but lack the localized semantics needed for dense prediction tasks requiring spatial precision and fine-grained detail.

Method: Uses additional self-supervised learning on pretrained representations with Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) objective to align dense feature distributions between teacher and student models, capturing statistical dependencies and structural relationships of patches. Also develops specialized augmentation strategies for dense representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across various dense vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively transfers semantic knowledge to dense feature space and demonstrates superior performance for dense prediction tasks compared to global representation approaches.

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Hanzhen Wang,Jiaming Xu,Jiayi Pan,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA is a training-free method that uses both local and global context for smarter token pruning in Vision-Language-Action models, achieving significant speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for VLA models only use local information from current actions, ignoring global context from prior actions, which causes >20% success rate drop and limited speedup.

Method: Two-level pruning with heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level using global history and local context, (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level based on layer-specific importance, (3) Lightweight action-aware controller that classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained and adjusts pruning aggressiveness accordingly.

Result: Achieves 1.46x speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57x speedup on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 compared to OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss on LIBERO benchmark.

Conclusion: Leveraging both local and global context for token pruning enables significant computational acceleration in VLA models while maintaining performance, addressing the limitations of previous methods that only used local information.

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

### [34] [SuMa: A Subspace Mapping Approach for Robust and Effective Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05625)
*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa is a novel concept erasure method that achieves both robustness and effectiveness for narrow concepts like copyrighted characters and celebrities by mapping target subspaces to reference subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods fail to handle narrow concepts (copyrighted characters, celebrities) while maintaining both robustness and image quality, creating legal and copyright concerns.

Method: Subspace Mapping (SuMa) derives a target subspace representing the concept to erase, then neutralizes it by mapping to a reference subspace that minimizes distance between them.

Result: SuMa achieves image quality comparable to effectiveness-focused approaches while matching the completeness of robustness-focused methods across four erasure tasks.

Conclusion: SuMa successfully addresses the challenge of erasing narrow concepts with close neighboring concepts, providing both robust removal and high-quality image preservation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning creates better tree representations from aerial hyperspectral images than direct use of vegetation properties, improving downstream ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image analysis with limited labels is challenging for precision agriculture, requiring better methods to extract vegetation properties from aerial imagery.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings that reflect vegetation properties of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields.

Result: The constructed tree representation using vegetation property-related embedding space outperforms direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties in downstream machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning provides superior tree representations from hyperspectral imagery, enhancing precision agriculture applications through improved feature extraction.

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11x performs best (63.7% mAP@0.5) for detecting Bangladesh-specific vehicles, but rare classes like Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons show near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection systems trained on non-Bangladeshi datasets fail to accurately identify local vehicle types, creating gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions like Bangladesh.

Method: Evaluated six YOLO model variants on custom dataset with 29 vehicle classes specific to Bangladesh, using high-resolution images captured with mobile phones and manually annotated with LabelImg in YOLO format.

Result: YOLOv11x achieved best performance (63.7% mAP@0.5, 43.8% mAP@0.5:0.95) but slow inference (45.8ms). Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) offered optimal balance with 62.5%/61.8% mAP@0.5 and 14-15ms inference. Rare vehicle classes showed near-zero accuracy.

Conclusion: This research provides foundation for Bangladesh-specific object detection systems, addressing critical needs for autonomous vehicle technology in developing regions where generic models fail, while highlighting challenges with rare vehicle classes and dataset imbalances.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

*Guandong Li,Zhaobin Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2 is a tuning-free solution for high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs that addresses identity consistency and semantic editing challenges through PerceiverAttention decomposition, ID loss, and dynamic training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character editing methods struggle with degraded capabilities, semantic biases, and identity breakdowns when handling long text narratives with multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships.

Method: Decomposes PerceiverAttention, introduces ID loss and joint dynamic training with diffusion model, and employs offline fusion strategy for integration module to achieve deep multi-level semantic editing with minimal data lubrication.

Result: Achieves excellent results in IBench evaluation, maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments while meeting demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation.

Conclusion: EditIDv2 successfully addresses the challenges of complex narrative scene editing through sophisticated architectural improvements and training strategies, enabling effective identity-preserving editing with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

*Xiaomeng Zhu,Changwei Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xinyu Liu,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a linguistic approach for scene graph anticipation using LLMs to forecast object appearances/disappearances and human-object relations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant long-term prediction improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene graph anticipation methods rely mainly on visual cues and struggle to incorporate commonsense knowledge, limiting long-term prediction robustness.

Method: Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) using LLMs: first forecasts object appearances/disappearances, then generates detailed human-object relations in a pure text-based approach.

Result: Short-term mean-Recall (@10) increased by 3.4%, long-term mean-Recall (@50) improved dramatically by 21.9%, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The linguistic approach effectively leverages commonsense knowledge through LLMs for scene graph anticipation, demonstrating significant improvements in both short-term and long-term predictions.

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

*Wasikul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-inspired denoising using pileup mitigation principles from particle physics improves robustness under strong noise corruption, with WIPUNet showing widening performance margins at higher noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage physics principles from particle physics (conservation, locality, isolation) to create more robust image denoising models that maintain performance under strong corruption where purely data-driven models degrade.

Method: Developed a hierarchy of pileup-inspired denoisers: conservation-constrained residual CNN, Gaussian-noise variants, and WIPUNet (Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network) that integrates physics principles into a UNet backbone.

Result: PU-inspired CNNs competitive with standard baselines on CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise; WIPUNet shows widening performance margin at higher noise levels (σ=15-100). Same trend observed on BSD500, demonstrating improved stability under strong corruption.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired priors from particle physics provide robustness advantages in image denoising, particularly under high noise conditions, without requiring heavy state-of-the-art machinery.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with multi-turn interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual reasoning, leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes CAMVR with Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) for storing visual features and textual representations, and Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) for dynamic attention adjustment. Uses multi-level reasoning integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets including VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, and novel MTIF dataset.

Conclusion: CAMVR effectively addresses multi-turn visual reasoning challenges by maintaining contextual coherence and improving visual-textual inference capabilities.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: MeshMetrics is a mesh-based framework that provides more accurate computation of distance-based segmentation metrics than conventional grid-based approaches, addressing implementation inconsistencies that cause significant discrepancies in existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility crisis in image segmentation research is partly due to unreliable metric implementations, where pitfalls in distance-based metrics lead to substantial discrepancies between common open-source tools (e.g., exceeding 100mm for Hausdorff distance).

Method: The authors developed MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that computes distance-based metrics more precisely than traditional grid-based approaches, reducing discretization artifacts like distance quantization.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation show that MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts.

Conclusion: MeshMetrics provides a more reliable implementation of distance-based segmentation metrics, addressing implementation inconsistencies that contribute to the reproducibility crisis in image segmentation research. The tool is released as an open-source Python package.

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human action recognition methods struggle with deep semantic understanding, complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinctions in diverse video data.

Method: Uses a Video-to-Semantic-Tokens Module to transform videos into discrete semantic action tokens, then processes them with LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (like LLaVA-13B) combined with natural language instructions for classification and reasoning.

Result: Achieves 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set, demonstrating state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR significantly improves both accuracy and interpretability in video action recognition by leveraging large language models' capabilities and generating natural language explanations for predictions.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely mainly on semantic RGB features and neglect spatial structural information, which is crucial for handling drastic viewpoint differences in cross-view geo-localization.

Method: Proposes JRN-Geo network with dual-branch feature extraction, Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM), Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA), and 3D geographic augmentation for generating viewpoint variation samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets, demonstrating robustness against complex viewpoint variations.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric structural information from normal images alongside RGB data significantly improves cross-view geo-localization performance by capturing better viewpoint-invariant features.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the

*Niels Balemans,Ali Anwar,Jan Steckel,Siegfried Mercelis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T extends LiDAR-BIND with temporal consistency mechanisms for multi-sensor fusion, improving SLAM performance through temporal alignment and motion-aware losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance temporal stability and coherence in multi-modal sensor fusion (radar, sonar to LiDAR) for improved SLAM robustness and performance.

Method: Three key contributions: temporal embedding similarity for latent alignment, motion-aligned transformation loss for displacement matching, and windowed temporal fusion with specialized module. Updated architecture for better spatial structure preservation.

Result: Improved temporal and spatial coherence, lower absolute trajectory error, better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM. Enhanced robustness and performance.

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while significantly improving temporal stability, making it more effective for downstream SLAM applications with practical temporal quality metrics.

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-LVI-SAM is a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework that uses a panoramic visual feature model to unify multiple fisheye camera data, with extrinsic compensation for improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate and robust state estimation by efficiently fusing data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR, and inertial sensors while addressing challenges in multi-camera integration.

Method: Proposes a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation, with extrinsic compensation to address frame misalignment issues. Integrated into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system using factor graph optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show enhanced quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Conclusion: The panoramic visual feature model with extrinsic compensation effectively improves feature consistency, reduces triangulation errors, and enables more accurate pose estimation in multi-sensor fusion systems.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

*Tianhao Guo,Bingjie Lu,Feng Wang,Zhengyang Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel distance-adaptive super-resolution framework that addresses spatially-varying degradation in real-world imaging through variational formulation with depth-dependent pseudodifferential operators and neural architecture with depth-conditional convolution kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional super-resolution assumes spatially-invariant degradation, but real-world imaging exhibits complex distance-dependent effects like atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions that require spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies.

Method: Variational framework formulating super-resolution as spatially-varying inverse problem using pseudodifferential operators with distance-dependent spectral characteristics. Neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels and learned distance-adaptive regularization terms.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2× and 4× scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework, demonstrating significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance on traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

### [48] [InterAct: A Large-Scale Dataset of Dynamic, Expressive and Interactive Activities between Two People in Daily Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05747)
*Leo Ho,Yinghao Huang,Dafei Qin,Mingyi Shi,Wangpok Tse,Wei Liu,Junichi Yamagishi,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new multi-modal dataset called InterAct captures realistic two-person interactions with diverse motions and long-term patterns, along with a diffusion-based method for generating interactive body motions and facial expressions from speech inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works either focus on single persons or limited conversational gestures with constant body positions, lacking realistic dynamic interactions between two people in daily scenarios.

Method: Captured 241 motion sequences with audio, body motions, and facial expressions of two actors performing coherent scenarios. Developed a diffusion-based hierarchical regression method with novel fine-tuning for lip accuracy.

Result: Created InterAct dataset with diverse complex motions and long-term interaction patterns. The proposed method effectively estimates interactive face expressions and body motions from speech inputs.

Conclusion: The InterAct dataset enables research on realistic two-person interactions, and the diffusion-based approach provides an effective solution for generating synchronized multi-person behaviors from speech.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

*Bingrui Zhao,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Xiangtian Fan,Deyin Liu,Lu Zhang,Ruyi He,Jialie Shen,Ximing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARSE-VOS is a training-free RVOS framework that uses LLMs to parse language queries and perform hierarchical reasoning for accurate video object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods struggle with complex compositional descriptions and aligning static text with dynamic visual content, especially when objects have similar appearances but inconsistent motion/poses.

Method: Hierarchical framework: 1) Parse language query into structured commands, 2) Spatio-temporal grounding for candidate trajectories, 3) Two-stage reasoning: coarse motion reasoning with LLM, then fine-grained pose verification if needed.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS benchmarks.

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS demonstrates that training-free hierarchical reasoning with LLMs effectively addresses complex RVOS challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictOBI-20k dataset for evaluating large multimodal models on visual decipherment of oracle bone characters, showing LMMs have preliminary skills but rely heavily on language priors rather than visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oracle bone characters are the oldest Chinese writing system but current decipherment methods are limited by sparse archaeological findings and small inscription corpus. LMMs offer potential for visual decipherment due to their visual perception capabilities.

Method: Created PictOBI-20k dataset with 20k OBC and real object images forming 15k+ multi-choice questions. Conducted subjective annotations to compare human-LMM visual reasoning consistency. Evaluated general LMMs on visual decipherment tasks.

Result: General LMMs show preliminary visual decipherment skills but are not effectively using visual information - most rely on language priors rather than visual cues.

Conclusion: The dataset facilitates evaluation and optimization of visual attention in OBC-oriented LMMs. Current LMMs need improvement in visual reasoning for accurate oracle bone character decipherment.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available

*Jonathan Aellen,Florian Burkhardt,Thomas Vetter,Marcel Lüthi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes pose alignment method for partial shape reconstruction in medical imaging to address bias from training-target pose differences, improving accuracy without original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose misalignment between training data and target shapes causes biased reconstructions, especially for small shape parts, which is often overlooked in point distribution models.

Method: Efficient method to adjust existing models to target pose, preserving linear model efficiency while improving reconstruction. Handles translations exactly and approximates small rotations without original training data.

Result: Significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance. Provides exact recovery for translations and good approximation for small rotations.

Conclusion: Simple preprocessing step enables plug-and-play adaptation of existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines, making the approach widely applicable.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

*Jongyoun Noh,Junghyup Lee,Hyekang Park,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage 3D detection framework that improves PointPillars by enabling voxel-based feature learning from pseudo images and adopting a two-stage pipeline with sparse scene context features, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PointPillars is efficient but underperforms compared to state-of-the-art 3D detectors due to limitations in preserving precise 3D structures and difficulty adopting two-stage detection pipelines with 3D object proposals.

Method: Proposes 3DPillars CNN architecture with separable voxel feature module that extracts 3D voxel-based features using 2D convolutions, and an RoI head with sparse scene context feature module that aggregates multi-scale features for two-stage refinement.

Result: Experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets show effectiveness and efficiency, achieving good compromise between speed and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully narrows the performance gap between PointPillars and state-of-the-art 3D detectors while retaining efficiency, making it the first two-stage 3D detection method using pseudo image representations.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

*In-Jae Lee,Sihwan Hwang,Youngseok Kim,Wonjune Kim,Sanmin Kim,Dongsuk Kum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAB is a novel camera-radar fusion model for 3D object detection that uses backward projection with radar to reduce depth ambiguity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous camera-radar fusion methods either struggle with sparse BEV feature generation (forward projection) or suffer from depth ambiguity leading to false positives (backward projection). The authors aim to address these limitations by leveraging radar to mitigate depth ambiguity in backward projection.

Method: CRAB uses backward projection to aggregate perspective view image features into BEV queries. It combines dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with sparse yet precise radar occupancy information to improve depth distinction. The method also introduces spatial cross-attention with radar context features to enhance 3D scene understanding.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods on nuScenes dataset with 62.4% NDS and 54.0% mAP in 3D object detection.

Conclusion: CRAB successfully addresses depth ambiguity in backward projection-based fusion by effectively leveraging radar's precise depth information, demonstrating superior performance in 3D object detection tasks.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing is challenging due to small imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements that demand reliable anomaly detection.

Method: Two attention-guided autoencoder architectures: 1) Structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM) for lightweight real-time defect detection, 2) Feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features for supervisory monitoring of distributional shifts.

Conclusion: The methods provide complementary capabilities for inline inspection and post-production surveillance, offering a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments while meeting EU AI Act requirements.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass

*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM extends SAM to generate multiple plausible segmentations by modeling segmentation distributions with latent variables, addressing annotation uncertainty in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM produces deterministic segmentations but real-world tasks like medical imaging have inherent ambiguity due to annotation uncertainty and inter-expert variability.

Method: Incorporates latent variable space with variational training, adding prior and posterior networks to SAM framework to modulate prompt embeddings with latent codes.

Result: Outperforms existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics, produces diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement on LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset.

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM enables uncertainty-aware segmentation with efficient sampling, capturing human annotation variability while maintaining SAM's flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Motivation: Dust storms pose health risks and reduce visibility, requiring rapid detection from satellites to provide timely warnings and monitoring.

Method: 3D convolutional network that learns patterns across all 36 MODIS bands plus split thermal bands, with simple normalization and local filling for missing data handling. Improved version increases training speed 21x.

Result: Achieved ~0.92 accuracy with 0.014 mean squared error on 17 independent MODIS scenes. Strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges.

Conclusion: Joint band-and-space learning enables timely global dust alerts; wider input windows or attention-based models could further improve edge detection.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

TL;DR: Deep learning segmentation models for carotid artery histopathology show performance instability due to limited data, with rankings driven more by statistical noise than true algorithmic superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures is vital for cardiovascular disease research, but development is constrained by scarcity of annotated histopathological data.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet) on limited cardiovascular histology dataset with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor performance differences driven more by statistical noise than true algorithmic superiority.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarking practices are limited in low-data clinical settings, and performance rankings may not reflect meaningful clinical utility due to data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful

*Yujie Li,Wenjia Xu,Yuanben Zhang,Zhiwei Wei,Mugen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTCChat is a novel multi-temporal MLLM that improves bi-temporal satellite image analysis with specialized change extraction and prompt augmentation mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs process bi-temporal satellite image pairs through simple concatenation, which inadequately models temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes, limiting their effectiveness in applications like urban monitoring and disaster assessment.

Method: Proposes BTCChat with a Change Extraction module to better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes, and a Prompt Augmentation mechanism that incorporates contextual clues to enhance attention to spatial details.

Result: Experimental results show BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: BTCChat effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by better modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes in bi-temporal satellite imagery, demonstrating superior performance in change understanding tasks.

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT is a multimodal deep learning framework that combines visual and skeletal data to classify musculoskeletal risk in athletes, achieving 93.89% test accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, but existing methods fail in complex environments due to reliance on single data types. Early risk assessment is crucial for prevention.

Method: ViSK-GAT combines Residual Block with Lightweight Transformer Block, featuring Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM) for inter-modal feature refinement and Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM) for cross-modal alignment. Uses custom multimodal dataset labeled into eight risk categories based on Rapid Entire Body Assessment system.

Result: Achieved 93.55% validation accuracy, 93.89% test accuracy, 93.86% precision, 93.85% F1 score, 93% Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Low RMSE of 0.1205 and MAE of 0.0156. Outperformed nine transfer learning backbones.

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT advances AI implementation for musculoskeletal risk classification, enabling impactful early interventions in sports through effective multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

*Ruiqi Shen,Haotian Wu,Wenjing Zhang,Jiangjing Hu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semantic image compression method using CLIP embeddings that achieves extreme compression (2-3*10^-3 bpp) while preserving semantic information across diverse tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging applications prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks, calling for advanced semantic compression paradigms.

Method: Proposes compressing CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits instead of reconstructing pixels, leveraging the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models.

Result: Achieves average bit rate of 2-3*10^-3 bpp (less than 5% of mainstream approaches), maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, and exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and tasks.

Conclusion: The CLIP-based semantic compression method provides extreme compression rates while preserving semantic information and demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization capabilities across various applications.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

### [61] [AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949)
*Qiqi Zhan,Shiwei Li,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriPrompt is a novel framework that enhances text prompts using CLIP's visual encoder features through attribute retrieval, dual-stream contrastive learning, and self-regularization to address limitations in current deep prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep text prompting approaches suffer from over-reliance on contrastive learning that neglects fine-grained feature optimization and use static prompts that prevent content-aware adaptation across different input categories.

Method: Uses Attribute Retrieval module to cluster visual features from CLIP's vision encoder layers, retrieves semantically similar prompts from a pool, concatenates them to text encoder inputs, implements Dual-stream Contrastive Learning for fine-grained alignment, and adds Self-Regularization between prompted and non-prompted features.

Result: Achieves up to 7.37% improvement in base-to-novel setting across three benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art methods and strong cross-domain knowledge transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: AttriPrompt effectively addresses limitations of current deep prompting methods and positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation through enhanced fine-grained alignment and content-aware adaptation.

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

### [62] [Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952)
*Feng Wang,Zihao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CPS method to eliminate noise artifacts in SDE-based sampling for RL-enhanced Flow Matching models, enabling more accurate reward modeling and stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE-based sampling introduces noise artifacts that harm reward learning in RL-enhanced Flow Matching models for image/video generation.

Method: Developed Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS) inspired by DDIM to reformulate sampling process and eliminate excess stochasticity during inference.

Result: CPS eliminates noise artifacts, enables more accurate reward modeling, and leads to faster, more stable convergence for RL optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

Conclusion: CPS provides an effective solution to noise issues in SDE-based sampling, improving RL performance for Flow Matching models without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

*Jeonghyun Noh,Wangsu Jeon,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) with cross-attention to fuse original and enhanced medical images, plus multi-scale boundary loss for better segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is hindered by noise, blurriness, and low contrast. Existing enhancement techniques may alter crucial diagnostic information, while conventional fusion methods fail to fully leverage both original and enhanced images.

Method: DIFM uses bidirectional cross-attention to exploit mutual complementary information between original and enhanced images, refining features via global spatial attention. Also introduces multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction.

Result: Experimental results on ACDC and Synapse datasets show superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DIFM effectively combines original and enhanced medical images while preserving crucial diagnostic information, achieving improved segmentation accuracy particularly at object boundaries.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Conclusion: StripDet provides superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and establishes itself as a practical solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

*Rafal Karp,Dawid Gruszka,Tomasz Trzcinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural network-based bloom lighting methods (NBL and FastNBL) achieve 12-28% faster performance than traditional techniques while maintaining high-quality visual effects in real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bloom lighting techniques rely on computationally expensive operations like multiple blur applications and texture sampling, which create bottlenecks in real-time rendering and consume significant execution time.

Method: Proposed two neural network-based approaches: Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL) that generate brightness masks from 3D scene views, eliminating the need for multiple blur operations and conditional branching.

Result: Both methods outperformed state-of-the-art bloom implementations, with FastNBL being 28% faster and NBL 12% faster, while maintaining high-quality bloom effects across various 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Neural network-based bloom lighting enables faster, more realistic lighting effects in real-time environments, saving computational resources and supporting higher FPS experiences while maintaining visual quality and immersion.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

*Yiqin Zhang,Meiling Chen,Zhengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning method for medical 3D imaging that uses three interpretable sub-tasks to capture spatial semantics while maintaining performance comparable to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods in medical visualization are adapted from 2D visual domains and lack interpretability regarding 3D spatial knowledge learning, making them less suitable for medical applications where interpretability is crucial.

Method: Proposes a method with three interpretable sub-tasks designed to capture spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging. The approach uses multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability and leverages the enhanced semantic depth of 3D imaging.

Result: Experimental results show the approach delivers performance on par with current methodologies while providing intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses interpretability issues in medical 3D self-supervised learning while maintaining competitive performance, making it more suitable for healthcare applications where understanding the learning process is important.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2 reframes style transfer as a data problem using destylization to create DST-100K dataset, enabling training of a simple feed-forward model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the fundamental challenge of lacking ground-truth data in artistic style transfer by creating authentic supervision signals through destylization.

Method: Develops DST (text-guided destylization model) and DST-Filter (multi-stage evaluation with Chain-of-Thought reasoning) to build DST-100K dataset, then trains OmniStyle2 based on FLUX.1-dev.

Result: OmniStyle2 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: Scalable data generation via destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm that overcomes the ground-truth data limitation in artistic style transfer.

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle proposes a novel domain generalization approach that maps all samples to a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge domain gaps, achieving significant performance improvements especially with limited training domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Existing DG methods struggle with limited training domains or large gaps between seen and unseen domains, requiring training on data that resembles unseen domains - a challenging task without prior knowledge.

Method: ConstStyle leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features. During training, all samples are mapped onto this unified domain optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen domain samples are similarly projected before predictions, aligning both training and testing data within the unified domain.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, with limited seen domains, it boosts accuracy up to 19.82% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: By aligning training and testing data within a unified domain, ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts and demonstrates strong robustness even with large domain gaps or few seen domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

TL;DR: STRIDE diffusion model for sparse-view CT reconstruction with temporal reweighting guidance and dual-network architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong generative capabilities but need adaptation for sparse-view CT reconstruction to handle missing projection views and distribution inconsistencies.

Method: Joint training with sparse conditional probabilities, temporally varying reweighting guidance, linear regression for distribution correction, and dual-network parallel architecture for multi-frequency optimization.

Result: Best improvement of 2.58 dB PSNR, 2.37% SSIM increase, and 0.236 MSE reduction compared to baseline methods on public and real datasets.

Conclusion: STRIDE achieves high-quality CT reconstruction with excellent generalization, robustness, structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled strategy using precomputed segmentation priors to enhance monocular 3D object detection without expanding model architecture, showing improved performance for small objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to lack of depth cues in single 2D images. Existing methods rely on CNNs or Transformers but struggle with depth estimation.

Method: Inject precomputed segmentation information priors directly into feature space to guide detection, without adding prediction branches or expanding the model.

Result: Outperformed equivalent RGB-only architecture on KITTI benchmark, particularly for small objects like pedestrians and cyclists.

Conclusion: Understanding input data through segmentation priors can compensate for need of additional sensors or training data in monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: Most existing spacecraft pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localization, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations.

Method: Adapts a deep learning framework from human pose estimation that combines Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder features with motion cues from pre-trained optical flow to localize 2D keypoints, then uses Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver for 6-DoF pose recovery.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localization and 6-DoF pose estimation on SPADES-RGB dataset, with promising generalization on SPARK-2024 real and synthetic data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates temporal motion information for spacecraft pose estimation, showing enhanced performance and good generalization across different data distributions.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

### [73] [BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06010)
*Wanyin Cheng,Zanxi Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT is a VQA framework that handles ambiguous visual questions from blind/low vision users by generating multiple answers, grounding them to image regions, and using chain-of-thought reasoning to assess answer consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLV users often take blurry photos and ask ambiguous questions, leading to multiple valid answers grounded in different image regions, which conventional single-answer VQA systems cannot handle effectively.

Method: Uses LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 to propose diverse candidate answers, PolyFormer for spatial grounding of each answer, and chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether answers refer to same or different regions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark and proves more robust to ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings for BLV users.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for VQA systems that adapt to real human uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users, with code made publicly available to foster accessibility research.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

*Zhenhai Weng,Zhongliang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed UAV-specific datasets and Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion module to address domain gap in Open-Vocabulary Object Detection for UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVD datasets are ground-level natural images, creating performance drop on UAV imagery due to domain gap.

Method: Developed UAV-Label engine, created UAVDE-2M (2M+ instances, 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k (15k+ images) datasets, and proposed CAGE module integrated into YOLO-World-v2.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone and SIMD datasets verified effectiveness for UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Conclusion: The proposed datasets and CAGE module successfully address the domain gap issue in UAV Open-Vocabulary Object Detection.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

*Zhiwen Shao,Yifan Cheng,Fan Zhang,Xuehuai Shi,Canlin Li,Lizhuang Ma,Dit-yan Yeung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel fine-grained dynamic perception framework for facial micro-expression recognition that uses rank-based feature encoding and dynamic image construction to address subtlety and data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial micro-expression recognition is challenging due to transient, subtle movements and limited training data. Existing methods either require key frames or suffer from small-scale datasets.

Method: Proposes a local-global feature-aware transformer for frame representation, rank scorer for dynamic encoding, and dynamic image construction module to capture subtle facial actions and augment training data.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11% F1-score improvements on CASME II, SAMM, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The FDP framework effectively captures micro-expression dynamics through rank-based feature encoding and dynamic image construction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual-LiDAR odometry approaches struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to leverage temporal information effectively, and require extensive manual tuning for different sensor configurations.

Method: Three key innovations: Sparse Query Fusion for multi-modal data fusion, Temporal Interaction and Update module for better pose initialization and robustness against accumulative errors, and Temporal Clip Training with Collective Average Loss for global optimization and reduced scale drift.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and Argoverse Odometry datasets in both pose accuracy and robustness, with high efficiency (82ms inference time) suitable for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: DVLO4D provides an effective solution for visual-LiDAR odometry that addresses key challenges in sensor fusion, temporal information utilization, and robustness while maintaining real-time capability.

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

TL;DR: TinyDef-DETR is a DETR-based framework for small-defect detection in UAV transmission line inspection, using stride-free downsampling, edge-enhanced convolution, dual-domain attention, and adaptive regression loss to improve detection of small defects against complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated UAV inspection of transmission lines faces challenges in detecting small, ambiguous defects due to detail loss from strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and insufficient integration of global context with local information.

Method: Proposes TinyDef-DETR with: 1) stride-free space-to-depth module for lossless downsampling, 2) edge-enhanced convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, 3) cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention for global-local information fusion, and 4) Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss for small object localization.

Conclusion: Integrating detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving

difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BranchGRPO reduces computational costs and improves training stability in image/video generative model alignment by introducing branch sampling, tree-based advantage estimation, and pruning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO methods suffer from high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards.

Method: Proposes BranchGRPO with three components: 1) branch sampling policy updating SDE sampling process, 2) tree-based advantage estimator with dense process-level rewards, and 3) pruning strategies for path and depth redundancy.

Result: Improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines while cutting training time by 50% in image and video preference alignment experiments.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO effectively addresses computational efficiency and training stability issues in generative model alignment while maintaining or improving exploration diversity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity CFD modeling is accurate but computationally expensive and requires expert knowledge, while conventional GNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in high-resolution thermal-fluid simulations.

Method: Proposed a novel multi-stage GNN architecture with hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model interactions across multiple spatial scales on irregular mesh structures.

Result: The model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art GNN baselines on natural convection CFD dataset.

Conclusion: The multi-stage GNN approach shows strong potential for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations, offering an efficient alternative to traditional CFD methods.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat

Result: Significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms on experimental datasets, with successful elimination of blurriness.

Conclusion: The technique successfully incorporates knowledge about homogeneity and sharp edges, producing high-quality reconstructions and showcasing potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of

favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning strategies for medical foundation models either isolate tasks (parallel fine-tuning) or require simultaneous access to all datasets (multi-task fine-tuning), failing to effectively handle incremental task integration and knowledge retention.

Method: Proposes MedSeqFT with two core components: 1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection to identify representative downstream samples, and 2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT) using LoRA-based knowledge distillation to balance task adaptation with knowledge preservation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies across ten 3D segmentation tasks with 3.0% average Dice improvement. Enhances transferability on unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney), particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses confirm robustness.

Conclusion: MedSeqFT establishes sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental trade-off in remote sensing: multispectral imagery has high spatial resolution but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectral data at lower spatial resolution. Existing methods struggle to preserve both spatial detail and spectral fidelity when generating hyperspectral data.

Method: SpecSwin3D uses a 3D shifted-window transformer framework that takes 5 multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands. It employs a cascade training strategy to progressively expand spectral range and uses an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and orders input bands to capture pairwise relations.

Result: The model achieves PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40°, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. It also demonstrates practical value in downstream tasks like land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D effectively addresses the spatial-spectral trade-off in hyperspectral generation, providing both high-quality reconstruction and practical utility for real-world applications in environmental monitoring and urban planning.

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

*Zhengquan Luo,Chi Liu,Dongfu Xiao,Zhen Yu,Yueye Wang,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinaGuard is a privacy-enhancing framework that protects retinal age information in fundus images while maintaining diagnostic utility and image quality through adversarial masking and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI can extract sensitive biometric data like retinal age from medical images, creating privacy risks where unauthorized use could lead to bioinformation leakage and privacy breaches.

Method: Feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure retinal age, combined with multiple-to-one knowledge distillation strategy using retinal foundation model and diverse surrogate age encoders for universal defense against black-box prediction models.

Result: Successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image quality and pathological feature representation, providing effective protection against unauthorized age extraction.

Conclusion: RetinaGuard offers a flexible privacy solution for medical image-derived biomarkers that balances privacy protection with clinical utility, and can be extended to protect other sensitive biometric data from medical images.

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse-1 is a unified model that generates coordinated audio and video using stitching of experts technique, avoiding training from scratch by fusing pre-trained video and music generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model capable of simultaneous audio-video generation with better coordination and alignment than existing methods, addressing performance degradation from misaligned text annotations.

Method: Uses stitching of experts (SoE) to fuse pre-trained video and music generation models, plus an online annotation pipeline for accurate temporal alignment of audio with video content during training.

Result: After fine-tuning on 7,600 hours of data, the model produces well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds and strong alignment for speech generation. Introduces Verse-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1 advances audio-video generation research, closes performance gap with state-of-the-art models like Veo3, and is made publicly available to benefit the research community.

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

### [89] [UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165)
*Huy Le,Nhat Chung,Tung Kieu,Jingkang Yang,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO is a unified single-stage framework for both box-level and pixel-level Video Scene Graph Generation that uses extended slot attention and temporal consistency learning without explicit tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VidSGG methods require separate architectures for coarse-grained box-level and fine-grained pixel-level tasks, with multi-stage training pipelines that lack efficiency and generalization.

Method: Extended slot attention decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. Object temporal consistency learning enforces frame-to-frame consistency without tracking. Dynamic triplet prediction links relations to object pairs over time.

Result: UNO achieves competitive performance on both box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks while offering improved efficiency through unified design and parameter sharing.

Conclusion: The unified object-centric approach demonstrates that both VidSGG tasks can be effectively addressed within a single end-to-end architecture with minimal task-specific modifications.

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based fracture detection using custom CNN achieves 95.96% accuracy on X-ray images, outperforming transfer learning models in this specific setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited access to expert radiology services in low-resource settings and overcome limitations of conventional imaging methods (high cost, radiation exposure, specialized interpretation dependency).

Method: Developed custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked against transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) using FracAtlas dataset of 4,083 musculoskeletal radiographs.

Result: Custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and 0.91 F1-score. Transfer learning models performed poorly in this specific setup.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs show promise for fracture detection in X-rays, but require fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

*Lucas Wojcik,Luiz Coelho,Roger Granada,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient document detection pipeline adapted from license plate detection network for real-time document rectification, achieving competitive OCR performance with smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time document detection and rectification is an unexplored niche but vital for automatic information retrieval from visual documents, with existing solutions focusing on either performance (larger models) or efficiency (smaller models) but not both.

Method: Adapted IWPOD-Net (license plate detection network) and trained it on NBID synthetic ID card dataset, experimented with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV dataset, compared with state-of-the-art methods using OCR quality metric based on Levenshtein distance.

Result: The model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while maintaining competitive OCR quality, showing that document rectification doesn't need to be perfect to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed efficient document detection pipeline successfully bridges the gap between performance and efficiency for real-time document processing, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve competitive OCR results without perfect rectification.

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

*Mohsen Gholami,Ahmad Rezaei,Zhou Weimin,Yong Zhang,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ego3D-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating VLMs' 3D spatial reasoning using ego-centric multi-view outdoor data, showing current VLMs fall short of human performance, with Ego3D-VLM framework improving spatial understanding by 12-56%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial understanding, especially in real-world embodied AI applications like robots and self-driving cars that rely on ego-centric multi-view observations, which existing single-image or indoor datasets don't adequately address.

Method: Created Ego3D-Bench with 8,600+ human-annotated QA pairs from ego-centric multi-view outdoor data. Proposed Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that generates cognitive maps based on estimated global 3D coordinates to enhance spatial reasoning.

Result: Benchmarked 16 SOTA VLMs showing significant performance gap vs human level. Ego3D-VLM achieved 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation, with modular integration capability to any VLM.

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM provide valuable tools for advancing toward human-level spatial understanding in real-world multi-view environments, addressing a major limitation of current VLMs for embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First study to estimate skin hydration and trans-epidermal water loss from selfie facial images using AI, enabling remote skin barrier assessment without specialized instruments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin barrier function is crucial for health but requires specialized clinic instruments to measure SH and TEWL, making regular monitoring inaccessible to general users.

Method: Developed a systematic solution with data collection, preprocessing, and a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model with symmetric-based contrastive regularization to address data imbalance.

Result: Successfully estimated SH and TEWL from facial selfies, bridging computer vision and skincare research for accessible skin analysis.

Conclusion: Enables AI-driven remote skin assessment from smartphone selfies, making skin barrier monitoring accessible for broader real-world applications without clinical visits.

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

### [94] [Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291)
*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML framework addresses visual grounding limitations in open-vocabulary scenes through prototype-aware multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based VG methods perform well in standard scenes but struggle with novel objects in open-vocabulary scenarios due to imperfect modality alignment, insufficient feature fusion, and ineffective semantic prototype utilization.

Method: Uses ALBEF for cross-modal alignment, Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder for salient object enhancement, prototype discovering/inheriting mechanism for semantic prototypes, and Multi-stage Decoder for multimodal integration before bounding box regression.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show competitive performance in standard scenes and state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scenes.

Conclusion: PAML effectively addresses key limitations in open-vocabulary visual grounding through systematic multimodal learning with prototype awareness, demonstrating superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

TL;DR: Proposes Video-GCD, a video extension of Generalized Category Discovery, with MCCL framework using temporal-spatial cues and memory-guided contrastive learning for novel category discovery in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static images alone are insufficient for reliable novel category discovery. Videos provide multi-perspective temporal information that can significantly improve category discovery performance.

Method: Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) with two components: CACL (uses temporal features for consistency scoring) and MGRE (dual-level memory buffer for feature and logit representations).

Result: Significantly outperforms image-based GCD approaches on new Video-GCD benchmark including action recognition and bird classification datasets.

Conclusion: Temporal information is crucial for discovering novel categories in videos, and the proposed MCCL framework effectively integrates multi-perspective temporal cues for improved Video-GCD performance.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: Text4Seg++ proposes a text-as-mask paradigm that converts image segmentation into a text generation problem using semantic descriptors, eliminating need for additional decoders and achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively integrating image segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains a significant challenge, as traditional approaches require complex decoders and specialized architectures.

Method: Uses semantic descriptors as textual representation of segmentation masks, with two variants: image-wise descriptors and box-wise descriptors with semantic bricks. Introduces Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE) for compression and efficiency. Formulates segmentation as next-brick prediction task.

Result: Achieves strong segmentation performance across natural and remote sensing datasets, outperforms state-of-the-art models without task-specific fine-tuning, reduces descriptor length by 74% and accelerates inference by 3x.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within MLLM framework, remaining compatible with existing MLLM backbones.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Motivation: To overcome limitations in 3D plant segmentation adoption due to scarce annotated datasets, technical adaptation difficulties, and lack of standardized benchmarks for plant science applications.

Method: Systematic review approach including: overview of existing 3D plant datasets, summary of deep learning methods for point cloud segmentation, development of Plant Segmentation Studio framework, and extensive quantitative experiments evaluating networks and sim-to-real strategies.

Result: Found sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation most effective, with synthetic data generation methods (modeling-based and augmentation-based) reducing annotation demands for sim-to-real learning.

Conclusion: The study bridges algorithmic advances with practical deployment, providing tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient, generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for

TL;DR: Unified framework for currency evaluation with denomination classification, damage quantification, and counterfeit detection using lightweight CNN models and novel UCDI metric for real-time on-device inference in low-resource environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing currency recognition systems overlook usability and authenticity assessment, especially for visually impaired users and offline validation in low-resource environments. Current methods focus only on denomination classification while ignoring physical degradation and forgery detection.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, 2) Damage quantification through Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI) based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural feature loss, 3) Counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. Dataset of 82,000+ annotated images covering clean, damaged, and counterfeit notes.

Conclusion: Accurate, interpretable, and compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical settings, addressing key deployment challenges in constrained environments with real-time performance.

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous

*Tz-Ying Wu,Sharath Nittur Sridhar,Subarna Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GO-Tokenizer improves video understanding in Video-LLMs by encoding object information directly rather than using textual descriptions, achieving better performance with less noise and token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-sensitive video understanding tasks benefit from grounded object information, but textual object descriptions add token length and noise to prompts.

Method: Propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight add-on module that uses off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly for Video-LLMs.

Result: Pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms vanilla Video-LLM and text-based object description methods across different models, datasets, and tasks like temporal localization and dense captioning.

Conclusion: Direct encoding of object information through GO-Tokenizer provides more efficient and effective video understanding compared to textual object descriptions in prompts.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP-FAS is a novel face anti-spoofing framework that improves cross-domain generalization by leveraging multiple text prompts and better utilizing CLIP's patch embeddings through Multi-View Slot attention and Multi-Text Patch Alignment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based face anti-spoofing methods underutilize patch embedding tokens and rely on single text prompts per class, limiting their ability to detect spoofing clues and generalize across domains.

Method: Proposes MVP-FAS with two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) for extracting detailed spatial features from patch embeddings using multiple text perspectives, and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA) for aligning patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing CLIP-based FAS methods by better utilizing patch embeddings and multiple text prompts, leading to improved cross-domain anti-spoofing performance.

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drought detection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while existing deep learning models require too many parameters for resource-limited agricultural settings.

Method: Proposed a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures, incorporating a gradient norm-based machine unlearning mechanism for targeted data influence removal.

Result: Achieved 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models while maintaining competitive accuracy on aerial potato field imagery with expert annotations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly suitable for resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single image super-resolution models struggle to generalize across varying scale factors, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: SAAM employs lightweight scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, uses Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance, and incorporates gradient variance loss to enhance image sharpness.

Conclusion: SAAM enables robust multi-scale upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world super-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated pipeline analyzes brain metastases growth patterns from longitudinal MRI data using clustering and machine learning to predict treatment response with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain metastases contribute significantly to cancer mortality and current manual analysis of longitudinal MRI follow-up images is too time-consuming for clinicians, limiting systematic quantification of treatment response.

Method: Implemented automated pipeline to curate longitudinal dataset of 896 brain metastases from 177 patients. Used data-driven clustering to identify growth trajectories and applied both classical gradient boosting and graph machine learning for 12-month response prediction.

Result: Identified 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct response categories. Achieved 0.90 AUC using gradient boosting and 0.88 AUC with graph ML for response prediction using only pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI data.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables automated, precise assessment of brain metastases response to stereotactic radiosurgery, providing foundation for clinical decision support systems and personalized care optimization.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

### [106] [3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06400)
*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new quantization scheme using spherical coordinates for 3D Gaussian Splatting that addresses position error issues in 3DoF+ scenarios where camera movement is limited to small offsets around a central position.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS enables 6DoF novel view synthesis but has limitations when input views come from a limited spatial zone (3DoF+ scenarios). Position errors during quantization cause projection errors that scale with squared inverse distance, requiring a better quantization approach.

Method: Proposed a spherical coordinate-based quantization scheme that accounts for the relationship between position error and projection error, which is proportional to squared inverse distance of projected points.

Result: The method demonstrates improved rate-distortion performance when tested on the Garden scene, showing better quantization efficiency for 3DoF+ applications.

Conclusion: Spherical coordinate quantization effectively addresses the specific error characteristics in limited-movement 3DGS scenarios, providing superior performance for 3DoF+ view synthesis applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight is a novel VCOD method that combines SAM and MLLM to address edge separation and object-background separability issues in video camouflaged object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods struggle with separating camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, while MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as they merge foreground and background information.

Method: Uses temporal and spatial clues for video representation, performs feature fusion via LLM, employs dynamic foreground visual token scoring and prompt network to guide SAM, and implements decoupled foreground-background learning strategy with separate cue generation and training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoCA-Mask dataset across various metrics and demonstrates strong generalization ability by detecting unseen camouflaged objects on CAD2016 dataset.

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight effectively addresses key limitations in VCOD by combining SAM and MLLM strengths while enhancing edge detail separability and object-background discrimination through innovative fusion and decoupled learning strategies.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Motivation: Traditional muzzle detection methods require extensive annotated datasets and are data-dependent, limiting performance on new cattle. Manual detection is labor-intensive and inconsistent.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot framework using Grounding DINO vision-language model that leverages natural language prompts for muzzle detection without task-specific training or annotated data.

Result: Achieves mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8%, demonstrating effective muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments without requiring annotated data.

Conclusion: First annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection, offering practical alternative to supervised methods with improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

TL;DR: PBAN is a novel full-reference image quality assessment method for super-resolution images that uses bidirectional attention and perception-oriented modules to better evaluate distorted SR images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing full-reference image quality assessment metrics for super-resolution algorithms are limited, and current attention-based methods don't adequately capture the bidirectional nature of SR image generation and evaluation processes.

Method: Three-module architecture: 1) Image encoder for feature representations, 2) Perception-oriented bidirectional attention module with Bidirectional Attention, Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, and Sub-information Excitation Convolution, 3) Quality prediction module to integrate features and regress scores.

Result: Extensive experiments show PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods for super-resolution image evaluation.

Conclusion: PBAN provides an effective full-reference IQA solution for SR images by incorporating human visual system characteristics and bidirectional attention mechanisms that align with SR image generation and evaluation processes.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

TL;DR: Proposes Cross3DReg dataset and overlap-based registration framework for cross-source point cloud alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-source point cloud registration faces challenges due to lack of large-scale real-world datasets and inherent sensor differences that negatively impact registration accuracy.

Method: Constructs Cross3DReg dataset from mechanical and semi-solid-state lidars, and designs an overlap-based framework using unaligned images to predict overlapping regions and visual-geometric attention guided matching for feature consistency.

Result: Achieves 63.2% reduction in relative rotation error, 40.2% reduction in relative translation error, and 5.4% improvement in registration recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-source registration challenges by leveraging image-geometric fusion and overlap prediction, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Motivation: Deep neural networks are dominant but hard to understand with surprising weaknesses. Adversarial attacks help uncover these vulnerabilities, especially challenging in black-box scenarios where model details are inaccessible.

Method: Developed two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms: 1) ATA (Affine Transformation Attack) maximizing attack score using random affine transformations, and 2) AGA (Affine Genetic Attack) combining random noise and affine transformations. Tested on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer using Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ATA and AGA algorithms effectively generate adversarial examples in black-box settings, outperforming existing methods and providing valuable insights for both attack and defense strategies in adversarial machine learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

TL;DR: CARVE is a training-free method that uses attention contrast between general and task-specific queries to extract task-relevant visual signals, improving VLM performance in complex visual environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models degrade in complex visual environments, and existing enhancement approaches require additional training, external tools, or operate at coarse levels, overlooking VLMs' innate capabilities.

Method: Analyze VLM attention patterns, discover correlation between visual complexity and attention entropy, and propose CARVE - a method that contrasts attention maps between general and task-specific queries to decompose visual signals into semantic components and noise.

Result: CARVE consistently enhances performance with up to 75% improvement on open-source models, demonstrating effectiveness across various visual tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient training-free pathway for improving visual reasoning through attention contrasting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

TL;DR: First statistical 3D shape model of the stomach combining synthetic data generation and real CT validation for robust anatomical variability modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of detailed 3D stomach models due to data scarcity and methodological challenges in capturing anatomical variability for medical applications.

Method: Novel pipeline for synthetic 3D stomach generation, statistical shape modeling in low-dimensional space, and semi-supervised alignment with real CT meshes for refinement.

Result: Model demonstrates robust generalization and fit accuracy on held-out test set of real stomach CT scans, with publicly available dataset and model.

Conclusion: Significant advancement in organ modeling enabling applications in surgical simulation, pre-operative planning, medical education, and personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3, a self-supervised vision transformer trained on natural images, demonstrates strong performance as a unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training, outperforming medical-specific models on some tasks but showing limitations in highly specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art vision foundation models like DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, can effectively transfer to medical imaging domains without requiring domain-specific pre-training.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 across various medical vision tasks including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on multiple medical imaging modalities, systematically analyzing scalability by varying model sizes and input resolutions.

Result: DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a strong baseline, even outperforming medical-specific models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks. However, performance degrades in highly specialized domains (WSIs, EM, PET) and scaling behavior is inconsistent in medical domain.

Conclusion: DINOv3 serves as a powerful baseline and robust visual prior for medical tasks, opening promising future directions like leveraging its features for 3D reconstruction consistency, despite limitations in deep domain specialization.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSG-Net is a novel frequency-spatial synergistic gated network that addresses false alarms and semantic gap issues in high-resolution remote sensing change detection through frequency domain processing, spatial attention, and gated fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two critical challenges in change detection: false alarms from radiometric variations (illumination, season) and the semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features that leads to poorly delineated boundaries.

Method: Proposes FSG-Net with three key components: 1) Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) for frequency domain processing to mitigate pseudo-changes, 2) Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM) to amplify genuine change regions in spatial domain, and 3) Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) to bridge semantic gap by selectively integrating details from shallow layers using high-level semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27% respectively.

Conclusion: FSG-Net effectively addresses both false alarm reduction and semantic gap issues in change detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach through frequency-spatial synergistic processing and gated fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

*Andrea Marelli,Alberto Foresti,Leonardo Pesce,Giacomo Boracchi,Mario Grosso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised segmentation approach called Before-After Supervision that trains models using visual differences between images before and after human operators remove unwanted items, applied to waste-sorting automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human operators are still essential for visual quality control in waste-sorting, but fully supervised computer vision approaches require extensive labeling. Weakly supervised alternatives using operator removal actions as implicit supervision remain unexplored.

Method: Proposes Before-After Supervision concept that trains segmentation networks using only visual differences between images acquired before and after operator actions. Introduces WS^2 dataset with 11,000+ high-resolution video frames and benchmarks state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods.

Result: Developed a robust end-to-end pipeline for weakly supervised segmentation in waste-sorting scenarios using the novel Before-After Supervision approach.

Conclusion: The Before-After Supervision framework provides a viable weakly supervised alternative to fully supervised methods for industrial quality control tasks like waste-sorting, reducing labeling requirements while leveraging natural operator actions as supervision.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIDE framework enables subject-driven image generation by balancing subject identity preservation with instruction compliance through target-supervised triplet alignment and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to reconcile the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions in subject-driven image generation.

Method: TIDE uses target-supervised triplet alignment with (reference image, instruction, target images) triplets and Direct Subject Diffusion objective, training with paired "winning" (balanced) and "losing" (distorted) targets for implicit reward modeling.

Result: Superior performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics while maintaining subject faithfulness and instruction compliance.

Conclusion: TIDE effectively resolves the preservation-compliance tension in subject-driven image generation without test-time fine-tuning and demonstrates versatility across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based glioblastoma treatment response classification using hybrid deep learning and radiomics features, achieving 0.81 ROC AUC for 4-class response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate evaluation of glioblastoma therapy response is crucial but complex using current RANO criteria, which are subject to observer variability. Need for automated, standardized assessment methods.

Method: Hybrid framework combining fine-tuned ResNet-18 deep learning features with 4800+ radiomic and clinical features including 3D radiomics, volumetric changes, and tumor centroid shift. Uses CatBoost classifier for 4-class prediction.

Result: Achieved mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and Macro F1 score of 0.50 in 4-class response prediction (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease).

Conclusion: Combining learned image representations with domain-targeted radiomic features provides robust automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

*Hua Chang Bakker,Stan Fris,Angela Madelon Bernardy,Stan Deutekom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reproducibility study of FairCLIP finds that while CLIP shows demographic bias in medical classification, the claimed fairness improvements from FairCLIP are not supported by experimental results on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reproducibility of FairCLIP's claims about improving group fairness in CLIP models for medical image-text applications, particularly in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Method: Reproduced the original FairCLIP experimental setup, identified discrepancies in model description vs implementation, created A-FairCLIP for design choice analysis, proposed FairCLIP+ for multiple attributes, and examined distance minimization impact on fairness and performance.

Result: CLIP was confirmed to be biased toward certain demographics in medical classification tasks. However, neither the official FairCLIP implementation nor the aligned A-FairCLIP improved performance or fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification, despite reducing Sinkhorn distances.

Conclusion: The original claims about FairCLIP improving CLIP's fairness and performance are not supported by experimental evidence. The regularization objective reduces distance metrics but fails to translate to actual fairness improvements in practical applications.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and tiny object tracking remains challenging in computer vision, and there's a need for standardized metadata formats to enhance dataset usability and enable better benchmarking of tracking algorithms.

Method: The authors create JSON metadata files (FMOX) with additional ground truth information including object size data for four existing FMO datasets. They then test EfficientTAM foundational tracking model on these enhanced datasets using Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores for evaluation.

Result: EfficientTAM performs comparably well with the pipelines originally tailored for these FMO datasets, demonstrating that foundational models can effectively handle fast moving object tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The FMOX JSON format provides valuable standardized metadata for FMO datasets, and foundational tracking models like EfficientTAM show promising performance on fast moving object tracking tasks, making both the format and model approach valuable contributions to the field.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

TL;DR: A robust training approach for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval that handles sketch ambiguity and noise without complex architectural changes, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inherent ambiguity and noise in real-world sketches, which previous work overlooked by focusing mainly on architectural improvements rather than training robustness.

Method: Combines appropriate pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation specifically designed to be robust to sketch variability, without introducing additional complexity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging FS-COCO and widely-used SketchyCOCO datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Highlights the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks and emphasizes the need to improve evaluation scenarios for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval.

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RARL method for incremental open set recognition that maintains decision boundaries by aligning unknown representations around inactive prototypes in angular space, using virtual classes and stratified rectification to handle evolving data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSR methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed scopes, but real-world applications require incremental identification of new unknown classes from continuous data streams while maintaining knowledge.

Method: Retentive angular representation learning (RARL) with virtual-intrinsic interactive training strategy and stratified rectification to compact known representations, enforce inter-class margins, and refine decision boundaries in angular space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets across various task setups, establishing a new benchmark for incremental open set recognition.

Conclusion: RARL effectively mitigates representation drift and maintains discriminative decision boundaries in evolving scenarios, solving the inter-class confusion problem in incremental open set recognition.

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Machine learning approach to learn reduced ordering approximating Condorcet ranking for vector-valued morphological operators in color image processing


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of consensus on suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators in vector-valued images like color and hyperspectral images

Method: Develop machine learning approach to learn reduced ordering that approximates Condorcet ordering derived from multiple vector orderings, inspired by voting problems

Result: Preliminary computational experiments confirm effectiveness of learning reduced mapping for defining vector-valued morphological operators in color images

Conclusion: Proposed machine learning approach successfully addresses the vector ordering problem in mathematical morphology for color image processing

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

*Xin Kong,Daniel Watson,Yannick Strümpler,Michael Niemeyer,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausNVS is an autoregressive multi-view diffusion model that generates 3D novel views sequentially, supporting flexible input-output configurations and precise camera control through pairwise-relative pose encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view diffusion models are non-autoregressive, limiting them to fixed view counts and suffering from slow inference due to simultaneous denoising of all frames, which restricts their applicability in world modeling.

Method: Train with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference, use spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to prevent drift.

Result: CausNVS supports broad camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The autoregressive approach with causal masking and precise camera control effectively addresses limitations of non-autoregressive methods, making multi-view diffusion more practical for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

### [127] [Detection of trade in products derived from threatened species using machine learning and a smartphone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06585)
*Ritwik Kulkarni,WU Hanqin,Enrico Di Minin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning models developed to automatically detect wildlife products (elephant ivory, pangolin scales, tiger parts) in images with 84.2% overall accuracy, deployed via smartphone app for real-time monitoring of illegal wildlife trade.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major biodiversity threat, increasingly occurring on digital platforms. Automated detection methods are needed to handle the large volume of content and identify prohibited wildlife products like ivory.

Method: Developed machine learning-based object recognition models using images of confiscated wildlife products. Tested various training strategies and loss functions, creating both species-specific models and a combined model for elephant, pangolin, and tiger products.

Result: Best model achieved 84.2% overall accuracy with species-specific accuracies: 71.1% (elephant), 90.2% (pangolin), 93.5% (tiger). Smartphone application implementation showed 91.3% accuracy for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The machine learning approach effectively detects wildlife products and can be deployed via smartphone app for real-time monitoring, making it applicable for both online trade monitoring and physical market surveillance by authorities.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

*Yichao Liu,YueYang Teng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSANet is a novel hybrid Swin attention network for LDCT/PET denoising that combines efficient global attention modules and hybrid upsampling to improve image quality while maintaining radiation safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT and PET reduce radiation exposure but introduce noise and artifacts that compromise diagnostic accuracy, creating a need for effective denoising methods.

Method: Proposed Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet) with Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules for spatial/channel interaction and hybrid upsampling module to prevent noise overfitting.

Result: HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods while maintaining lightweight model size suitable for standard GPU deployment.

Conclusion: The approach is highly practical for real-world clinical applications, providing effective denoising without compromising the radiation safety benefits of LDCT/PET.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

### [129] [Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625)
*Aswini Kumar Patra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel deep learning framework using CNN-LSTM with multi-modal imaging achieves 98% accuracy in classifying nitrogen stress severity under combined drought and weed competition conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of nitrogen stress is crucial in complex agricultural environments where multiple stresses interact, making it difficult to distinguish nitrogen deficiency effects from other stressors like drought and weed competition.

Method: Spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline combining CNN for spatial feature extraction from RGB, multispectral, and infrared images with LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies from time-series canopy image data across three nitrogen levels.

Result: CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved 98% accuracy, significantly outperforming spatial-only CNN (80.45%) and previously reported machine learning methods (76%) in nitrogen stress severity classification.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM approach effectively captures complex stress interactions and provides a robust platform for timely nitrogen stress identification, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

### [130] [Investigating Location-Regularised Self-Supervised Feature Learning for Seafloor Visual Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06660)
*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Emma J Curtis,Samuel Simmons,Kazunori Nagano,Stan Brown,Adam Riese,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Location-based regularization improves self-supervised learning for seafloor image analysis, with CNNs benefiting more from low-dimensional representations and ViTs showing strong generalization with high-dimensional features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance marine monitoring efficiency by improving high-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor imagery through better self-supervised learning methods using location metadata.

Method: Evaluated impact of location-based regularization on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks (CNN and ViT models) across three diverse seafloor image datasets with varying latent-space dimensionality.

Result: Location-regularization consistently improved downstream classification performance: average F1-score gains of 4.9±4.0% for CNNs and 6.3±8.9% for ViTs. CNNs benefited more from low-dimensional representations, while ViTs showed strong generalization with high-dimensional features.

Conclusion: Location metadata provides valuable regularization for SSL, particularly beneficial for low-dimensional latent representations, while high-dimensional ViTs demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities for seafloor image analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Sam Fenton,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online clustering framework for real-time unsupervised seafloor image analysis that adapts to continuous data streams with bounded computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to enable adaptive missions and optimize communication efficiency in autonomous underwater vehicles, overcoming limitations of offline methods that require complete datasets and human labeling.

Method: Online clustering framework (OCF) that operates unsupervised on continuous data streams, using representative sampling to capture evolving feature distributions, supporting dynamic cluster merging/splitting without reprocessing full history.

Result: Achieves highest average F1 score of 0.68 across three seafloor datasets with 3% standard deviation, demonstrating superior clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation while maintaining bounded computational time.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient survey data summaries and supports informative path planning for long-term autonomous marine exploration with real-time adaptive capabilities.

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

*Shengkai Zhang,Yuhe Liu,Guanjun Wu,Jianhua He,Xinggang Wang,Mozi Chen,Kezhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting framework that uses monocular images for novel-view synthesis in large scenes by combining sparse accurate depth from visual-inertial SfM with dense but coarse depth from large foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian Splatting requires accurate depth from RGB-D/stereo cameras with limited range, while monocular images lack depth guidance. Large foundation models for monocular depth estimation suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and texture ambiguity.

Method: Leverages sparse but accurate depth from visual-inertial SfM to refine dense but coarse depth from LFMs. Uses object-segmented depth propagation algorithm for structured objects and dynamic depth refinement module for dynamic objects.

Result: Experiments on public and customized datasets demonstrate superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VIM-GS successfully generates dense, accurate depth from monocular RGB inputs, enabling high-quality Gaussian Splatting rendering in large scenes without requiring specialized depth-sensing hardware.

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

TL;DR: A lightweight semantic segmentation framework called BioLite U-Net is proposed for real-time bioprinting monitoring, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to MobileNet baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time monitoring of bioprinting processes is crucial for maintaining print quality and biological viability, but challenging due to limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware constraints.

Method: Developed a manually annotated dataset of 787 RGB bioprinting images with three classes (nozzle, bioink, background), and created BioLite U-Net architecture using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy.

Result: BioLite U-Net achieved 92.85% mIoU and 96.17% Dice score, was over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+, and performed inference in 335 ms per frame on Raspberry Pi 4B.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net provides superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE proposes a novel diffusion-based method for industrial anomaly synthesis that addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating background priors, graded diffusion, and explicit mask alignment to generate realistic, fine-grained anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SIAS methods lack intricate texture details, fail to align precisely with background, and struggle to generate pixel-level fine-grained anomalies, limiting their effectiveness for downstream anomaly segmentation tasks.

Method: STAGE uses a novel anomaly inference strategy with clean background as prior, graded diffusion framework with anomaly-only branch to record local anomalies, and explicit mask alignment (EMA) strategy for progressive background alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVTec and BTAD datasets show STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS and enhances downstream anomaly segmentation.

Conclusion: STAGE effectively addresses critical limitations in industrial anomaly synthesis through its innovative diffusion-based approach with background guidance and explicit alignment, demonstrating superior performance in generating realistic anomalies.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumors require early diagnosis but manual MRI examination is error-prone and requires expertise, creating need for automated diagnosis systems that are both accurate and explainable for clinical use.

Method: Used Figshare dataset with 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images. Evaluated 9 CNN architectures, selected EfficientNetV2 as backbone, integrated attention-based MLP-Mixer, used Grad-CAM for visualization, and employed five-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1 score, outperforming existing literature. Grad-CAM visualizations showed effective focus on relevant MRI regions.

Conclusion: The combined EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer model provides a robust, high-accuracy, and interpretable solution for clinical decision support in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zo3T is a zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided image-to-video generation that uses 3D-aware kinematic projection, dynamic LoRA adapters, and guidance field rectification to achieve realistic motion without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory-guided I2V generation either require computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce datasets or produce unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and causing misalignment between manipulated latents and noise predictions.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection using scene depth for perspective-correct transformations, 2) Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA with dynamic adapters and regional feature consistency loss, 3) Guidance Field Rectification with one-step lookahead strategy to refine denoising paths.

Result: Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in zero-shot trajectory-guided video generation by ensuring 3D perspective correctness, maintaining generative fidelity, and enabling efficient progression towards target trajectories without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

TL;DR: Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using mutual enhancement between tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies treat tissue semantic segmentation and nuclei instance segmentation separately, ignoring their inherent relationship and resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding

Method: Proposes a co-segmentation paradigm with region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) for semantic/instance region prompts and mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) for cross-guidance and contextual consistency

Result: Extensive experiments on PUMA dataset show Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei

Conclusion: The collaborative approach effectively addresses the relationship between tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks, achieving superior performance in histopathology image analysis

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Motivation: Traditional UAV sensing approaches in forest environments suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light, especially under forest canopies, limiting effective navigation and data collection.

Method: Uses structured light with modulated wavelength projection to simultaneously capture depth and spectral information (650-850 nm bands) through a single sensor, enabling both depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging.

Result: Demonstrated 60% RMSE improvement over commercial depth sensors, comparable spectral accuracy to reference spectrometers, and 30% accuracy improvement in material differentiation when combining depth with spectral data compared to color-only methods.

Conclusion: The system provides lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception for complex natural environments, enabling high-performance depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation in challenging forest conditions.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Result: Generates event streams closely resembling real event cameras while benefiting from higher resolution and autofocus capabilities, supports real-time operation on Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based vision research and early-stage system development, enabling flexible adaptation to various application requirements.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark humor in online memes presents unique challenges due to implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues, with a lack of resources and methods for multimodal detection.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-augmented framework using Large Vision-Language Models with Role-Reversal Self-Loop to generate structured explanations, then fuses text, image, and reasoning features via Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet).

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses multimodal dark humor understanding and provides a valuable dataset and framework for content moderation research.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Motivation: To create high-fidelity synthetic datasets that can enhance existing real-world datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity for lidar perception tasks, while enabling testing of custom scenarios through simulation modifications.

Method: Synthesized datasets using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins modeled based on actual locations' geometry, road alignment at lane level, and lane topology/vehicle movement patterns at intersections. Evaluated through statistical and structural similarity analysis.

Result: High similarity scores with real data and improved 3D object detection performance when models trained solely on synthetic data were tested on real, unseen data, outperforming models trained on real data.

Conclusion: UrbanTwin datasets are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can effectively replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models.

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: UMO is a unified multi-identity optimization framework that addresses identity confusion in image customization by reformulating multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem using reinforcement learning on diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans are highly sensitive to faces, making identity preservation challenging in image customization. Current methods struggle with maintaining consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion when using multiple reference images, limiting identity scalability.

Method: UMO uses a "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm to reformulate multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem. It applies reinforcement learning on diffusion models and includes a scalable customization dataset with both synthesized and real multi-reference images.

Result: Extensive experiments show UMO significantly improves identity consistency and reduces identity confusion across several image customization methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation among open-source methods.

Conclusion: UMO successfully addresses the challenge of identity confusion in multi-reference image customization, providing a scalable solution that maintains high-fidelity identity preservation while setting new benchmarks for identity consistency in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

TL;DR: This paper shows that finetuning generic foundation models on surgical video data and integrating additional OR data streams improves performance for surgical data science tasks like predicting hospital stay, complications, and phase recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how transfer learning adaptation of foundation models and integration of complementary OR modalities can support surgical data science applications in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Used V-JEPA as foundation model, finetuned on unlabeled surgical videos, integrated additional time-resolved OR data streams via separate encoder to form shared representation space, tested on liver surgery videos and public HeiCo dataset.

Result: Finetuning on domain-specific data increased model performance. Additional OR data integration benefited in-house data tasks. Pretrained video-only baseline matched top EndoVis2017 submissions, with further accuracy gains from finetuning.

Conclusion: Surgical data science can effectively leverage public foundation models through domain adaptation and integration of complementary OR data streams, demonstrating significant potential for improved surgical support systems.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While
prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper
investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA
Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47
different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a
sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude
increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This
study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

*Hajar Moradmand,Lei Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework (ARTSS) automates rheumatoid arthritis severity scoring from hand X-rays, achieving 99% joint identification accuracy and low prediction error with Vision Transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scoring of rheumatoid arthritis severity using Total Sharp Score is time-consuming and subjective, with significant inter- and intra-observer variability that needs to be addressed.

Method: Four-stage framework: 1) Image pre-processing with ResNet50, 2) Hand segmentation with UNet.3, 3) Joint identification with YOLOv7, 4) TSS prediction using multiple models including VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer. Evaluated with 3-fold cross-validation on 970 patients.

Result: Joint identification achieved 99% accuracy. Vision Transformer performed best with Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Framework handles joint disappearance and variable-length sequences effectively.

Conclusion: ARTSS demonstrates deep learning's potential to automate RA scoring, offering time savings, reduced variability, improved accuracy, and better clinical decision support for rheumatologists.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

*Aymen Merrouche,Stefanie Wuhrer,Edmond Boyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A topology-adaptive deformation model for non-rigid 3D mesh matching that handles topological artifacts and works on highly non-isometric shapes without data-driven priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios like per-frame multi-view reconstructions often suffer from topological artifacts that break assumptions of current approaches (Functional Maps assume near-isometric deformation, ARAP-like approaches assume ARAP deformation).

Method: Propose a topology-adaptive deformation model allowing topological changes to align shape pairs under ARAP and bijective association constraints. Jointly optimize for a template mesh with adequate topology and its alignment with target shapes.

Result: Approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artifacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions, outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles topological artifacts in 3D mesh matching without relying on data-driven priors, demonstrating superior performance even compared to trained methods on challenging real-world data.

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective GAN-based deblurring preprocessing combined with YOLOv5 for license plate detection and character recognition achieves high accuracy (95-97%) and real-time performance (0.026s detection time) in ALPR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR is crucial for smart cities but faces challenges due to high variability and blur issues that deep learning can address more efficiently.

Method: Proposes selective GAN deblurring preprocessing + YOLOv5 for license plate detection, character segmentation, and recognition. Uses Iranian license plate datasets representing real-life scenarios.

Result: Achieves 95% LPD accuracy, 97% CR accuracy, 0.026s detection time. Deblur-GAN improves detection accuracy by nearly 40% for blurred license plates.

Conclusion: YOLOv5 provides excellent precision and speed for portable applications, while Deblur-GAN preprocessing significantly enhances overall model effectiveness, especially for blurred inputs.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

*Morteza Kiani Haftlang,Mohammadhossein Malmir,Foroutan Parand,Umberto Michelucci,Safouane El Ghazouali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight real-time medical image segmentation model combining Swin Transformer encoder with U-Net decoder, using self-supervised pretraining for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models like U-Net have limited receptive field, while transformer-based models are too deep and computationally expensive for real-time clinical use.

Method: Combines Swin Transformer-like encoder with U-Net-like decoder via skip connections. Uses Barlow Twins self-supervised pretraining on encoder before fine-tuning for segmentation.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameters and faster inference compared to existing models.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient alternative for real-time medical image segmentation in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

*Minheng Chen,Youyong Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 2D/3D registration method using spherical feature spaces and Riemannian distances in SO(4) space for better manifold structure preservation and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence in intraoperative 2D/3D registration, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Extract feature embeddings with CNN-Transformer encoder, project into spherical space, approximate geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in bi-invariant SO(4) space, and use differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization.

Result: Superior accuracy achieved on both real and synthetic datasets in patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Conclusion: Spherical feature spaces with Riemannian geometry provide more expressive and geometrically consistent similarity metrics, enhancing registration performance and convergence speed.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained diffusion models for blind image restoration tasks without the need for additional feature extractor training, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Extracts features directly from degraded images using the pre-trained model itself, extends self-attention mechanism with degraded features, and introduces a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world degradations while having significantly lower complexity.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter's adapter-based design enables integration into various diffusion models, expanding their capabilities for broader image restoration applications beyond their original training scope.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat is a crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained on the largest wheat image dataset (ImAg4Wheat) that outperforms general-domain models across 10 in-field vision tasks for wheat and shows transferability to other crops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain pretrained vision models fail to generalize well for agricultural monitoring due to the complex interaction of fine canopy structures with varying field conditions, necessitating crop-specific foundation models.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining on ImAg4Wheat dataset containing 2.5M high-resolution wheat images collected over 10 years across 30 global sites, spanning 2,000+ genotypes and 500+ environmental conditions.

Result: FoMo4Wheat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general-domain models across ten in-field vision tasks at both canopy and organ levels, demonstrating robustness for wheat and transferability to other crops and weeds.

Conclusion: Crop-specific foundation models provide reliable in-field perception and represent a path toward universal crop foundation models with cross-species and cross-task capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRG framework alternates between text reasoning and image generation to improve T2I models, achieving 5-10 point gains on multiple benchmarks through interleaved thinking-reflection cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models have improved image generation but still lag behind tightly coupled systems like GPT-4o in instruction following and detail preservation. Recent advances in interleaving reasoning suggest this approach could enhance T2I generation.

Method: Introduces Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG) framework that alternates text-based thinking with image synthesis, followed by reflection and refinement. Uses IRGL training with two sub-goals: strengthening initial think-generate stage and enabling high-quality reflection. Trained on IRGL-300K dataset with six learning modes, using two-stage training from a unified foundation model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN benchmarks. Shows substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity.

Conclusion: Interleaving reasoning between text and image generation significantly improves T2I model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of alternating thinking and reflection cycles for better instruction following and detail preservation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

*Wenhao Li,Mengyuan Liu,Hong Liu,Pichao Wang,Shijian Lu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H₂OT is a hierarchical pruning-and-recovering framework that improves efficiency of video pose transformers by dynamically selecting representative tokens and recovering full sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video pose transformers (VPTs) have high computational costs that make them impractical on resource-constrained devices, requiring more efficient approaches.

Method: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H₂OT) with Token Pruning Module (TPM) to select representative tokens and Token Recovering Module (TRM) to restore full-length sequences, reducing intermediate tokens while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show H₂OT achieves both high efficiency and estimation accuracy, demonstrating that full pose sequences are unnecessary and few representative tokens suffice.

Conclusion: The framework is general-purpose, works with common VPT models, and effectively accommodates different pruning/recovery strategies while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.
