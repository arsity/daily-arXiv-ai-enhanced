### [1] [Salience Adjustment for Context-Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15878)
*Bin Han,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a salience-adjusted framework that combines Bayesian Cue Integration and Visual-Language Models to improve emotion recognition by dynamically weighting facial expressions and contextual information based on facial expressivity, tested in prisoner's dilemma scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts is challenging because it requires understanding the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. Current approaches may not adequately balance these different sources of information based on their relative importance or expressivity.

Method: The authors developed a salience-adjusted framework that integrates Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the expressivity of facial cues. The approach adjusts the relative importance of different information sources depending on how expressive the facial cues are.

Result: The salience adjustment approach enhanced emotion recognition performance when evaluated using both human annotations and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios designed to evoke emotional reactions.

Conclusion: Incorporating salience adjustment into context-aware emotion recognition systems improves performance and offers promising directions for extending this framework to broader social contexts and multimodal applications in future research.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of
the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This
paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion
recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models
(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the
expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations
and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,
which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

Conclusion: Document Haystack provides a much-needed benchmark for evaluating VLMs on long document processing tasks, revealing current model capabilities and limitations while identifying potential research directions in this underexplored area.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly
advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from
different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains
under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this,
we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the
construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present
results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this
area.

### [3] [PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)
*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates generative data augmentation for object re-identification using a novel PAT++ pipeline that incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation, but finds that generated images consistently degrade performance due to domain shifts and loss of identity-defining features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative data augmentation has shown success in various vision tasks, its effectiveness for object re-identification - which requires preserving fine-grained visual details essential for identity recognition - remains largely unexplored and needs systematic evaluation.

Method: The authors develop PAT++, a novel pipeline that incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into the Part-Aware Transformer framework. They conduct extensive experiments using the Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, testing generated images for both model training and query expansion scenarios.

Result: The experiments reveal consistent performance degradation when using generative augmentation for object re-identification. The degradation is attributed to domain shifts between real and generated images and the failure of generative models to retain critical identity-defining features necessary for accurate re-identification.

Conclusion: The findings challenge common assumptions about the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and highlight significant limitations in current visual augmentation approaches for identity-preserving applications, suggesting that generative data augmentation may not be suitable for object re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

### [4] [Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911)
*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LDRLD (Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation), a knowledge distillation method that captures fine-grained inter-class relationships through recursive logit decoupling and recombining, combined with an Adaptive Decay Weight strategy to dynamically prioritize critical category pairs for improved student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logit distillation methods lack thorough exploration of fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge, limiting their ability to provide detailed insights for student learning and potentially missing important inter-class relationships that could enhance knowledge transfer.

Method: The method introduces LDRLD which recursively decouples and recombines logit information to capture inter-class relationships, employs an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy with Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD) to dynamically adjust weights for critical category pairs, and distills remaining non-target knowledge to ensure completeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches, showing improved student model performance through fine-grained knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: LDRLD successfully improves knowledge distillation by focusing on fine-grained inter-class relationships and dynamically weighting critical category pairs, achieving competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while providing more detailed insights for student learning.

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

*Mohammad Asifur Rahim,Muhammad Nazmul Arefin,Md. Mizanur Rahman,Md Ali Hossain,Ahmed Moustafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for early mpox detection using transfer learning and enhances interpretability with Grad-CAM explainable AI technique, achieving 95% accuracy with InceptionV3 on binary classification and 93% with MobileNetV2 on multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mpox diagnosis is challenging due to similarities with other skin conditions, and while AI has potential for medical image analysis, pre-trained CNN models and explainable AI techniques for mpox detection remain underexplored, necessitating evaluation of their effectiveness for early detection.

Method: Applied transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) by freezing initial layers and adding custom layers, trained on MSLD and MSLD v2.0 datasets for binary and multi-class classification, and used Grad-CAM for model interpretability and visualization of critical image features.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved best performance on binary dataset with 95% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 performed best on multi-class dataset with 93% accuracy. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted key image regions, though some models showed overfitting tendencies with discrepancies between training and validation losses.

Conclusion: Pre-trained CNN models show significant potential for monkeypox detection, and XAI techniques provide valuable interpretability. Future research should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data, and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic reliability and model transparency.

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency

### [6] [A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961)
*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight face quality assessment framework using normalized facial landmarks and Random Forest Regression achieves 96.67% accuracy in filtering low-quality face images, resulting in 99.7% reduction in false rejection rates when integrated with ArcFace face verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face verification systems suffer from poor performance when processing low-quality images caused by motion blur, poor lighting, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, leading to higher false rejection and acceptance rates in real-time applications like surveillance and access control.

Method: The framework uses normalized facial landmarks combined with a Random Forest Regression classifier to automatically assess face image quality and pre-filter low-quality images before they enter the verification pipeline.

Result: Achieved 96.67% accuracy in quality assessment, 99.7% reduction in false rejection rate, enhanced cosine similarity scores with ArcFace model, and outperformed existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency on a real-world dataset of 600+ subjects from Dubai Police CCTV footage.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images in real-time screening applications, specifically addressing face resolution variations and pose deviations prevalent in practical surveillance scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

### [7] [FW-VTON: Flattening-and-Warping for Person-to-Person Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16010)
*Zheng Wang,Xianbing Sun,Shengyi Wu,Jiahui Zhan,Jianlou Si,Chi Zhang,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FW-VTON, a novel three-stage method for person-to-person virtual try-on that extracts, warps, and integrates garments between different individuals, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a new dedicated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on methods focus on garment-to-person tasks requiring flat garment representations, but there's a need for person-to-person try-on that can work with garments worn by different individuals using only two input images (target person and source person wearing the garment).

Method: The paper proposes Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (FW-VTON) with three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image, (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose, and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. They also create a new dataset specifically for person-to-person try-on scenarios.

Result: FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative assessments for person-to-person virtual try-on tasks, and also demonstrates superior performance in garment extraction subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FW-VTON method successfully addresses the person-to-person virtual try-on challenge by introducing a three-stage approach that can generate realistic combinations of target persons with desired garments from source images, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

### [8] [Is Tracking really more challenging in First Person Egocentric Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16015)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark study to separate the challenges of first-person viewpoint from human-object activity domain in egocentric visual tracking and segmentation, questioning whether performance drops are due to the egocentric perspective itself or the nature of human-object activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research claimed egocentric vision presents unique challenges for visual tracking and segmentation, but these evaluations were conducted across different scenarios. The authors question whether performance drops stem from the first-person viewpoint specifically or from the broader domain of human-object activities, as many challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric vision also exist in third-person videos.

Method: The authors design a new benchmark study with an evaluation strategy that enables precise separation of challenges related to the first-person perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity understanding. This allows for disentangling the factors that contribute to performance differences.

Result: The benchmark provides deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation by distinguishing between viewpoint-specific challenges and domain-related challenges in human-object activity understanding.

Conclusion: The study facilitates more targeted advancements in egocentric visual tracking and segmentation by providing a clearer understanding of which challenges are truly unique to the first-person perspective versus those inherent to human-object activity domains in general.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

### [9] [Artifacts and Attention Sinks: Structured Approximations for Efficient Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16018)
*Andrew Lu,Wentinn Liao,Liuhui Wang,Huzheng Yang,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates massive tokens and artifact tokens in vision transformers, revealing their mutual suppression through attention mechanisms, and proposes Fast Nyström Attention (FNA) - a training-free linear-time approximation method that exploits these token patterns for efficient inference across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers' inner workings remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the role of massive tokens (with high activation norms acting as attention sinks) and artifact tokens that emerge during inference. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for improving transformer efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors analyze massive and artifact tokens to understand their mutual suppression through attention mechanisms. They develop Fast Nyström Attention (FNA), a training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space by exploiting structured patterns of these tokens. They also propose a masking strategy to reduce noise from these tokens.

Result: FNA demonstrates competitive performance on multiple vision tasks including retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering (VQA) while significantly reducing computational overhead. The masking strategy provides modest performance gains at virtually no additional cost.

Conclusion: The study reveals that massive and artifact tokens play a critical role in regulating information flow in vision transformers through mutual suppression. The proposed FNA method successfully exploits these token patterns to achieve efficient linear-time attention approximation without requiring retraining, making it practically applicable to existing pretrained vision models.

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [10] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpelkeNet, a visual world model that segments images based on Spelke objects (groups that move together physically) rather than semantic categories, achieving better performance than supervised methods like SAM and improving downstream manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision segmentation relies on semantic categories, but developmental psychology suggests humans perceive the world through Spelke objects - physical groupings that move together when acted upon by forces. This category-agnostic approach based on causal motion relationships could better support manipulation and planning tasks.

Method: The authors develop SpelkeNet, a visual world model trained to predict future motion distributions. It estimates motion affordance maps (regions likely to move under interaction) and expected-displacement maps (how the scene will move). They use "statistical counterfactual probing" with virtual pokes on high-affordance regions to define Spelke segments through correlated motion statistics.

Result: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on the newly introduced SpelkeBench dataset. The Spelke concept also demonstrates practical utility, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation across various manipulation models.

Conclusion: The Spelke object concept provides a more physically grounded approach to image segmentation that outperforms semantic-based methods and offers practical advantages for downstream manipulation tasks, suggesting that motion-based segmentation aligns better with physical reasoning requirements.

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [11] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAFER, a feature-level adversarial attack method that improves transferability by disrupting both semantic and abstract (high-frequency) features using BLOCKMIX and SELF-MIX techniques to compute better feature importance weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-level adversarial attacks primarily focus on manipulating semantic information when computing feature importance weight matrices. However, CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (abstract features like texture and edges), suggesting that incorporating high-frequency space transformations could improve adversarial transferability in black-box settings.

Method: The paper proposes SAFER (Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption), which uses a balanced approach combining BLOCKMIX on input images and SELF-MIX on frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix. This approach highlights crucial features in both semantic and abstract domains, directing attackers to disrupt both types of features simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SAFER effectively boosts adversarial transferability compared to existing feature-level attacks. The method successfully improves the transfer success rate by incorporating both semantic and high-frequency abstract features in the attack process.

Conclusion: SAFER provides an effective solution for improving adversarial transferability by balancing the disruption of both semantic and abstract features. The incorporation of high-frequency components through frequency spectrum manipulation proves beneficial for generating more transferable adversarial examples in black-box attack scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

### [12] [Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)
*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves personalized image generation by using feedback-based fine-tuning with multiple detectors (pose, human-object-interaction, facial recognition, gaze estimation) to address issues with complex activities, identity preservation, and natural gaze patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generation methods suffer from three major limitations: incorrect human poses in complex activities, poor preservation of reference human identities, and unnatural/inconsistent human gaze patterns that don't match scene descriptions.

Method: The authors propose feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods using state-of-the-art detectors for pose, human-object-interaction, facial recognition, and gaze-point estimation. They implement timestep-based integration of different feedback modules, distinguishing between low-level signals (like human pose) and high-level signals (like gaze point) during the diffusion process.

Result: The generated images show improvements in human interactions, facial identity preservation, and overall image quality when evaluated on three benchmark datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Feedback-based fine-tuning with multiple specialized detectors can effectively address key limitations in personalized image generation, leading to more accurate human poses, better identity preservation, and more natural gaze patterns in generated images.

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a stop-band energy constraint for orthogonal tunable wavelet units in CNNs to improve image classification and anomaly detection, achieving significant accuracy gains on texture-rich datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve CNN performance on image classification and anomaly detection tasks, particularly for texture-rich datasets where traditional convolution operations may not capture texture patterns effectively.

Method: The method introduces a stop-band energy constraint for filters in orthogonal tunable wavelet units with a lattice structure, which is integrated into CNN architectures (ResNet-18/34) to enhance convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations.

Result: The method achieves accuracy improvements of 2.48% on CIFAR-10 and 13.56% on the Describable Textures dataset when integrated into ResNet-18, with similar improvements in ResNet-34.

*Yaofang Liu,Yumeng Ren,Aitor Artola,Yuxuan Hu,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaotong Zhao,Alan Zhao,Raymond H. Chan,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Dandan Tu,Jean-Michel Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pusa introduces vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) for video diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image-to-video generation with 200x lower training cost and 2500x smaller dataset while enabling zero-shot multi-task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models are limited by rigid temporal modeling through conventional scalar timesteps, leading to computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, and narrow applicability in existing approaches. There's a need for fine-grained temporal control within a unified framework.

Method: The paper presents Pusa with vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA), a non-destructive adaptation technique that preserves base model capabilities while enabling fine-grained temporal control. They finetune the SOTA Wan2.1-T2V-14B model using VTA to surgically inject temporal dynamics without combinatorial explosion.

Result: Pusa achieves VBench-I2V total score of 87.32% (vs. 86.86% for Wan-I2V-14B) with dramatically reduced training cost (≤1/200, $500 vs. ≥$100,000) and dataset size (≤1/2500, 4K vs. ≥10M samples). It unlocks zero-shot multi-task capabilities including start-end frames and video extension without task-specific training.

Conclusion: Pusa establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for video synthesis that democratizes high-fidelity video generation. The approach preserves foundation model generative priors while enabling superior temporal control, setting new standards for next-generation video diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces tunable wavelet units (UwUs) for 3D retinal layer segmentation in OCT images, replacing conventional max-pooling with three wavelet-based downsampling modules that preserve both low- and high-frequency features, achieving improved accuracy on the JRC OCT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional max-pooling has limitations in preserving spatial detail and structural consistency in 3D retinal layer segmentation from OCT volumes, necessitating better downsampling approaches that can maintain both low- and high-frequency features for improved segmentation performance.

Method: The authors integrate three wavelet-based downsampling modules (OrthLattUwU, BiorthLattUwU, and LS-BiorthLattUwU) into a motion-corrected MGU-Net architecture.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study to apply tunable wavelet units (UwUs) for
3D retinal layer segmentation from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes.
To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three
wavelet-based downsampling modules, OrthLattUwU, BiorthLattUwU, and
LS-BiorthLattUwU, into a motion-corrected MGU-Net architecture. These modules
use learnable lattice filter banks to preserve both low- and high-frequency
features, enhancing spatial detail and structural consistency. Evaluated on the
Jacobs Retina Center (JRC) OCT dataset, our framework shows significant

highlighting the benefits of tunable wavelet filters in volumetric medical
image segmentation.

*Guichen Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Xiangjun Gao,Che Sun,Yuwei Wu,Shenghua Gao,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongSplat is an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework for long-sequence images that uses a streaming update mechanism and Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR) to achieve efficient novel view synthesis while reducing memory costs by 44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for novel view synthesis are limited in online long-sequence scenarios due to slow per-scene optimization or lack of efficient incremental updates, which hinders continuous performance in real-time applications.

Method: The paper proposes a streaming update mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. The key innovation is Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), which encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured 2D image-like format to enable efficient fusion and identity-aware redundancy compression. They also leverage existing image compression methods to generate more compact and higher-quality 3D Gaussians.

Result: LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction performance while reducing Gaussian counts by 44% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LongSplat framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods in online long-sequence scenarios by providing an efficient streaming update mechanism that maintains high-quality novel view synthesis while significantly reducing computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

*Yasser Ashraf,Ahmed Sharshar,Velibor Bojkovic,Bin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first video action recognition dataset using spike cameras, along with synchronized RGB and thermal data, to benchmark Spiking Neural Networks and enable multimodal video understanding research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video action recognition lacks datasets specifically designed for spike cameras, which offer superior energy efficiency and temporal resolution compared to traditional cameras. There's a need for comprehensive benchmarking platforms that can leverage the unique properties of spiking data while enabling comparison across different modalities (spike, RGB, thermal).

Method: The authors created a multimodal video action recognition dataset that simultaneously captures data from spike cameras, RGB cameras, and thermal cameras. The dataset preserves the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, enabling direct comparison between the three modalities and providing a platform for training and evaluating Spiking Neural Networks.

Result: The paper presents three synchronized datasets (spike, RGB, thermal) for video action recognition that maintain the temporal precision and sparsity characteristics of spike camera data. This creates the first comprehensive benchmarking platform for comparing spiking-based action recognition against traditional RGB and thermal modalities.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundational dataset resource that will advance research in energy-efficient video understanding using spike cameras. The multimodal nature of the dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks and facilitates the development of ultra-low-power video action recognition systems.

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,
specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.

*Jyun-Ze Tang,Chih-Fan Hsu,Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen), a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in latent space using a lightweight upsampler, improving both efficiency and visual quality in text-to-image generation while avoiding artifacts from traditional pixel-space scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for speeding up text-to-image synthesis perform early denoising at lower resolutions but downscale/upscale in pixel space, which introduces artifacts and distortions when upscaled images are re-encoded into latent space, leading to degraded final image quality.

Method: The authors develop Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen), a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler, without altering existing Transformer or U-Net architectures.

Result: LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches in comprehensive evaluations covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality. When generating 1024² images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246% TOPIQ score improvement compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LSSGen successfully addresses the artifacts and quality degradation issues of traditional pixel-space scaling methods by operating directly in latent space, demonstrating superior performance in both efficiency and visual quality while enabling flexible multi-resolution generation.

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

*Hui Ye,Haodong Chen,Zeke Zexi Hu,Xiaoming Chen,Yuk Ying Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMNet is an asymmetric multi-modal network that efficiently integrates RGB imagery and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data for semantic segmentation in remote sensing by using asymmetric encoders, modality-aware fusion, and distribution alignment to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal semantic segmentation in remote sensing faces two major limitations: increased computational complexity due to architectural redundancy when integrating RGB and DSM data, and degraded segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues undermine efficiency and robustness, particularly in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is essential.

Method: The paper proposes AMMNet with three key components: (1) Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE) that uses a deeper encoder for RGB to capture rich contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse structural features, reducing architectural redundancy; (2) Asymmetric Prior Fuser (APF) that integrates a modality-aware prior matrix to generate structure-aware contextual features; (3) Distribution Alignment (DA) module that enhances cross-modal compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence minimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that AMMNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among multi-modal networks while simultaneously reducing computational and memory requirements compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AMMNet successfully addresses the key challenges in multi-modal remote sensing segmentation by providing an asymmetric architecture that balances segmentation performance with computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for complex urban environment analysis where both accuracy and efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

### [20] [AtrousMamaba: An Atrous-Window Scanning Visual State Space Model for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16172)
*Tao Wang,Tiecheng Bai,Chao Xu,Bin Liu,Erlei Zhang,Jiyun Huang,Hongming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AtrousMamba, a novel visual state space model that combines Mamba's linear complexity for long sequences with enhanced local feature extraction through an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, achieving superior performance on change detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based visual methods focus on enhancing global receptive fields but overlook the importance of local information in dense prediction tasks. There's an open question about whether Mamba can effectively extract local features like CNNs do, which is critical for tasks requiring fine-grained details.

Method: The authors propose AtrousMamba with an atrous-window selective scan mechanism that gradually expands the scanning range with adjustable rates. This shortens distances between adjacent tokens and incorporates the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module to design end-to-end frameworks for binary change detection (AWMambaBCD) and semantic change detection (AWMambaSCD).

Result: Experimental evaluation on six benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based methods for change detection tasks, showing that Mamba can effectively capture both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local details.

Conclusion: The study proves that Mamba models can effectively balance global context integration with local feature extraction, demonstrating their capability to preserve fine-grained local details while maintaining their strength in capturing long-range dependencies in visual data.

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

*Fansheng Zeng,Bineng Zhong,Haiying Xia,Yufei Tan,Xiantao Hu,Liangtao Shi,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSTrack proposes a visual tracking method that explicitly models contextual reasoning through three mechanisms: context reasoning, forward supervision, and efficient state modeling to improve temporal consistency and prevent tracking drift while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream tracking algorithms associate context by simply stacking historical information without explicit supervision, making it difficult to effectively model target's evolving dynamics and leading to contextual association divergence in temporal modeling.

Method: RSTrack employs three core mechanisms: 1) Context Reasoning Mechanism that constructs a target state reasoning pipeline converting unconstrained associations into temporal reasoning; 2) Forward Supervision Strategy using true target features as anchors to constrain reasoning and suppress drift; 3) Efficient State Modeling with compression-reconstruction to extract core target features and remove redundant information.

Result: RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds, effectively alleviating contextual association divergence issues in traditional temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The three collaborative mechanisms in RSTrack successfully enhance temporal consistency in visual tracking by explicitly supervising the contextual reasoning process, leading to superior performance compared to traditional methods that rely on simple historical information stacking.

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces EBench-18K, a large-scale benchmark with 18K edited images and human preference annotations for evaluating text-guided image editing models, and proposes LMM4Edit, a multimodal language model-based metric that aligns well with human preferences for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided image editing (TIE) models struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with original images. Existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations in scale and alignment with human perception, creating a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: The authors create EBench-18K benchmark containing 1,080 source images, 18K+ edited images from 17 TIE models, 55K+ human-annotated mean opinion scores across three dimensions, and 18K+ QA pairs. They then develop LMM4Edit, a large multimodal model-based metric that evaluates image editing across multiple dimensions including perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy.

Result: LMM4Edit demonstrates outstanding performance and strong alignment with human preferences. The method shows good generalization ability through zero-shot validation on other datasets. The benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation across 21 editing tasks using 17 state-of-the-art TIE models.

Conclusion: EBench-18K provides the first large-scale benchmark for text-guided image editing evaluation with fine-grained human annotations. LMM4Edit offers an effective all-in-one evaluation metric that aligns well with human preferences and generalizes across datasets, advancing the field of text-guided image editing evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

### [23] [A Single-step Accurate Fingerprint Registration Method Based on Local Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201)
*Yuwei Jia,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching points between two fingerprints, eliminating the need for initial minutiae-based registration and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-step fingerprint registration methods (initial minutiae-based registration followed by dense registration) frequently fail when fingerprint image quality is low due to reduced minutiae detection, causing the entire registration process to fail. This creates a need for a more robust registration approach that doesn't rely heavily on minutiae detection.

Method: The authors develop an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching point correspondences between two fingerprints. The method incorporates global-local attention mechanisms to achieve pixel-level alignment without requiring an initial minutiae-based registration step.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art matching performance using only single-step registration. Additionally, the algorithm can be combined with dense registration methods to further improve performance beyond what either approach achieves independently.

Conclusion: The single-step registration approach successfully addresses the limitations of traditional two-step methods by eliminating dependence on minutiae detection quality. This results in more robust fingerprint registration, particularly for low-quality images, while maintaining competitive performance and offering flexibility for integration with existing dense registration techniques.

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Motivation: Existing computer vision research focuses on limited subsets of perception tasks, constraining their applicability and versatility. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle the full spectrum of perception tasks across different prediction types (box/mask) and instruction types (word/sentence-based).

Method: The authors propose MVP-LM with three key components: (1) a multi-granularity decoder that handles both word and sentence-based tasks with box and mask predictions, (2) a CoT-inspired dataset unification strategy for seamless supervised fine-tuning across tasks, and (3) a query enhancement strategy to leverage VLLMs' decoding and generative capabilities.

Conclusion: MVP-LM successfully addresses the limitation of existing perception research by providing a versatile, unified framework that can handle diverse perception tasks with different granularities and instruction types, demonstrating improved applicability across various computer vision contexts.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we
introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and
generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted
across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception
tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework. The code will be available at

Motivation: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods suffer from noise introduced by pseudo point clouds from depth completion, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. The authors aim to address this by leveraging the different reliability levels of each modality.

Method: A two-stage refinement framework where: (1) First stage uses LiDAR-only to generate accurately localized proposals, (2) Second stage incorporates pseudo point clouds to detect challenging instances, (3) Results from both stages are merged. Additionally, introduces a hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module that encodes neighborhood sets using feature and positional residuals.

Result: The framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels on the KITTI dataset, demonstrating improved 3D object detection compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By separating the roles of LiDAR and camera data through a two-stage approach and enhancing pseudo point cloud representation with hierarchical residual encoding, LDRFusion effectively addresses the noise issues in multi-sensor fusion while maintaining detection accuracy.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

*Shreelekha Revankar,Utkarsh Mall,Cheng Perng Phoo,Kavita Bala,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MONITRS, a multimodal dataset of 10,000+ FEMA disaster events combining satellite imagery with natural language annotations to improve machine learning-based disaster monitoring and response systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disaster response systems face limitations due to difficulty accessing affected areas and existing computer vision approaches that have narrow focus on specific disaster types, rely on manual expert interpretation, and lack datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations for tracking disaster progression.

Method: The authors created MONITRS, a novel multimodal dataset containing more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite imagery, natural language annotations from news articles, geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. They then fine-tuned existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning existing MLLMs on the MONITRS dataset yielded significant performance improvements for disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine learning-assisted disaster response systems.

Conclusion: The MONITRS dataset successfully addresses the limitations of current disaster monitoring approaches by providing a comprehensive multimodal resource that enables better automated disaster response systems through improved machine learning model performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
existing MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for
disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine
learning-assisted disaster response systems. Code can be found at:

### [27] [Positive Style Accumulation: A Style Screening and Continuous Utilization Framework for Federated DG-ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16238)
*Xin Xu,Chaoyue Ren,Wei Liu,Wenke Huang,Bin Yang,Zhixi Yu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SSCU framework for federated domain generalization in person re-identification, which screens positive styles that improve generalization while filtering out negative ones, and uses a memory-based approach to continuously utilize these beneficial styles across distributed training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods for person re-identification improve sample diversity through style transformation, but not all generated styles contribute positively to generalization performance. Some styles may actually harm the model's ability to generalize across domains, creating a need to distinguish between beneficial (positive) and harmful (negative) styles.

Method: The authors propose Style Screening and Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework with three key components: (1) Generalization Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) to screen and accumulate positive styles for each client, (2) Style memory recognition loss to fully leverage memorized positive styles, and (3) Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy that trains client models on two branches using both newly generated styles and accumulated positive styles from memory.

Result: Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing federated domain generalization approaches for person re-identification in both source domain and target domain scenarios, demonstrating improved generalization performance through effective positive style screening and utilization.

Conclusion: The SSCU framework successfully addresses the challenge of style quality in federated domain generalization by distinguishing between positive and negative styles, effectively screening beneficial styles through memory mechanisms, and continuously utilizing them via collaborative training strategies to achieve superior generalization performance across domains.

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

*Chao Zhou,Tianyi Wei,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses text instruction neglect in unified image generation models like OmniGen by proposing Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), which dynamically scales attention activation for each sub-instruction to improve instruction-following fidelity without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation models suffer from text instruction neglect, particularly when text instructions contain multiple sub-instructions, leading to conflicts between neglected sub-instructions and input image activations in cross-attention maps.

Method: Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS) leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to dynamically scale attention activation for each sub-instruction, requiring no additional training or test-time optimization.

Result: Experimental results on instruction-based image editing and visual conditional image generation demonstrate superior instruction-following fidelity compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of SaaS.

Conclusion: SaaS successfully addresses the text instruction neglect problem in unified image generation models by dynamically scaling attention activations, enhancing instruction-following fidelity without additional computational overhead during training or inference.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vector mapping from remote sensing imagery are constrained to small image patches, leading to loss of contextual information and fragmented vector outputs. With increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery, there's a need for methods that can process large-size images holistically to maintain context and produce complete vectorized geographic objects.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-size RSI datasets including buildings, water bodies, and roads demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vectorized geographic object extraction from large-size remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: HoliTracer successfully addresses the limitations of existing patch-based methods by providing the first framework capable of holistic vectorized geographic object extraction from large-size remote sensing imagery, maintaining contextual information and producing complete vector outputs across multiple geographic object types.

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information

HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-centric pipeline that improves fisheye camera object detection by identifying model blind spots through error analysis and addressing them via synthetic image generation with edge-case synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion that creates unique challenges for object detection models trained on conventional datasets, leading to poor performance in specialized scenarios with peripheral distortions and underrepresented contexts.

Method: The authors conduct detailed error analysis to identify critical edge-cases (confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, underrepresented contexts), then fine-tune an image generative model with carefully crafted prompts to synthesize images replicating real-world failure modes, which are pseudo-labeled and integrated into training.

Result: The approach achieves consistent performance gains in fisheye object detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of the data-centric pipeline in addressing model weaknesses through targeted synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: Deep understanding of data characteristics and selective fixing of weaknesses through edge-case synthesis can be highly impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object detection, proving the value of data-centric approaches over purely algorithmic solutions.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its

### [31] [Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257)
*Futa Waseda,Saku Sugawara,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QT-AFT, a method that uses high-quality captions during adversarial training to improve the robustness of vision-language models like CLIP against adversarial attacks while maintaining performance on diverse zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods for vision-language models have limitations: supervised methods overfit to training class labels using short texts, while unsupervised methods lack semantic guidance against text-guided adversarial attacks. There's a need for better adversarial training that leverages language to enhance visual robustness without overfitting.

Method: Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT) leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This approach enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize broader image features under adversarial noise by using rich linguistic supervision instead of short class labels.

Result: QT-AFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy when evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. The method successfully overcomes overfitting issues in supervised adversarial training and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised approaches. Additional insights show that describing object properties beyond just names further enhances robustness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that high-quality linguistic supervision is crucial for robust visual representation learning. QT-AFT effectively combines the benefits of semantic guidance with broad generalization, pointing to the importance of centering quality language supervision in future robust vision-language model development.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

### [32] [ToFe: Lagged Token Freezing and Reusing for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16260)
*Haoyue Zhang,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToFe (Token Freezing and Reusing), a framework that improves Vision Transformer efficiency by temporarily freezing unimportant tokens instead of discarding them, allowing their reuse in later blocks while reducing computational cost by 50% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are computationally expensive due to self-attention mechanisms, hindering deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing token reduction methods irreversibly discard tokens, but different transformer blocks focus on different information, so early-discarded tokens might be useful later. There's a need to balance model performance with computational efficiency.

Method: The ToFe framework identifies important tokens at each stage and temporarily freezes unimportant ones for later reuse. It includes: (1) a prediction module for token identification, (2) an approximate module for frozen token recovery, and (3) computation budget-aware end-to-end training that jointly optimizes with the backbone to adaptively process necessary tokens at each block.

Result: ToFe reduces computational cost of LV-ViT model by 50% while maintaining less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy. The method achieves better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The ToFe framework successfully addresses the efficiency challenges of Vision Transformers by introducing a token freezing and reusing mechanism that preserves important information while significantly reducing computational overhead, making ViTs more suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Junhao Su,Feiyu Zhu,Hengyu Shi,Tianyang Han,Yurui Qiu,Junfeng Luo,Xiaoming Wei,Jialin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAN++ is a supervised local learning method that uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and learnable scaling bias to enable communication between network blocks, achieving performance comparable to end-to-end backpropagation while significantly reducing GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end backpropagation suffers from update locking, high GPU memory consumption, and lack of biological plausibility. Existing supervised local learning methods partition networks into blocks but suffer performance degradation due to limited inter-block information flow.

Method: The paper proposes Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++) which introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance inter-block communication. A learnable scaling bias is added to balance feature differences between local blocks.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and image segmentation across multiple network architectures show that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: MAN++ offers a viable alternative to conventional training methods by providing a novel perspective for supervised local learning that maintains performance while addressing the memory and computational limitations of end-to-end backpropagation.

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

*Zefeng Qian,Xincheng Yao,Yifei Huang,Chongyang Zhang,Jiangyong Ying,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a framework that uses Large Language Models to break down action labels into atomic descriptions and combines them with visual segmentation for improved few-shot action recognition in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot action recognition faces challenges due to limited training data, and existing approaches using additional text modalities cannot fully capture the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and object interactions that are critical for understanding actions beyond simple action labels.

Method: LGA uses LLMs to anatomize action labels into atomic action descriptions focusing on subject, motion, and object elements. A Visual Anatomy Module segments videos into atomic phases. The framework employs fine-grained fusion at the atomic level and introduces a Multimodal Matching mechanism with both video-video and video-text matching for classification.

Result: LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple few-shot action recognition benchmarks, demonstrating improved classification accuracy through better exploitation of spatiotemporal cues and more generalizable prototypes.

Conclusion: The proposed Language-Guided Action Anatomy framework successfully addresses few-shot action recognition challenges by leveraging LLM knowledge to dissect action semantics and combining it with visual anatomy, resulting in superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dens3R is a 3D foundation model that jointly predicts multiple geometric quantities (depth, surface normals, point maps) from images using a unified framework that models structural coupling between different geometric properties, achieving better consistency and accuracy than methods that predict single quantities in isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense 3D reconstruction methods are limited to predicting single geometry quantities from input images, but geometric quantities like depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated. Estimating them in isolation fails to ensure consistency, limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates the need for a unified framework that explicitly models structural coupling among different geometric properties.

Method: Dens3R uses a two-stage training framework with a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and position-interpolated rotary positional encoding. It progressively builds a pointmap representation that is generalizable and intrinsically invariant. The method integrates image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling and includes a post-processing pipeline for geometrically consistent multi-view inference.

Result: Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across various dense 3D prediction tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents Dens3R as an effective 3D foundation model for joint geometric dense prediction that outperforms existing single-quantity prediction methods. The unified framework successfully models structural coupling between geometric properties, leading to improved consistency and accuracy in dense 3D reconstruction tasks, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D

*Yanchen Liu,Yanan Sun,Zhening Xing,Junyao Gao,Kai Chen,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionShot is a training-free framework that enables smooth motion transfer between objects with significant appearance or structural differences by using semantic feature matching and morphological alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a reference object to a target object when there are significant differences in appearance or structure between them, creating a need for better motion transfer techniques.

Method: MotionShot uses a two-step approach: (1) semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between reference and target objects, and (2) reference-to-target shape retargeting to establish low-level morphological alignments. Motion is encoded using temporal attention for coherent transfer.

Result: The framework successfully transfers motion across objects with significant appearance and structure disparities while preserving coherence in appearance, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MotionShot provides an effective training-free solution for fine-grained motion transfer between dissimilar objects by combining semantic and morphological alignment techniques with temporal attention encoding.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

*Kailai Zhou,Fuqiang Yang,Shixian Wang,Bihan Wen,Chongde Zi,Linsen Chen,Qiu Shen,Xun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces M-SpecGene, the first generalized RGBT (RGB-Thermal) multispectral foundation model that learns modality-invariant representations through self-supervised learning, addressing limitations of task-specific approaches through a novel Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity metric and progressive masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGBT multispectral vision research follows a case-by-case paradigm with manually customized models for specific tasks, which is limited by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck issues. There's a need for a unified approach that can generalize across multiple RGBT tasks.

Method: The authors develop M-SpecGene, a foundation model using self-supervised learning on large-scale data. They introduce Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify information density across RGB and thermal modalities, and implement a GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy for flexible, easy-to-hard, object-centric pre-training.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets covering four different RGBT downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the unified foundation model approach over task-specific methods.

Conclusion: M-SpecGene successfully addresses the limitations of case-by-case RGBT research by providing a generalized foundation model that learns modality-invariant representations, offering new insights into multispectral fusion and unifying previous studies into a single paradigm with strong cross-task generalization capabilities.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

*Joseph De Mathia,Carlos Francisco Moreno-García*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates Scene Text Detection and Recognition (STDR) performance using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, analyzing how environmental factors like lighting, distance, and resolution affect OCR algorithms in real-world egocentric vision scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of wearable technology and AR applications, there's a need to understand how STDR algorithms perform in real-world conditions through egocentric vision, particularly for assistive and research applications like asset inspection and nutrition analysis.

Method: The researchers created a custom dataset using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses under controlled conditions and evaluated two OCR pipelines (EAST with CRNN, and EAST with PyTesseract) while analyzing the impact of environmental variables including lighting, distance, and resolution. They also explored image upscaling as a preprocessing technique and investigated eye-gaze tracking integration.

Result: Resolution and distance significantly impact recognition accuracy, while lighting has less predictable effects. Image upscaling proved effective as a preprocessing technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. Eye-gaze tracking showed potential for optimizing processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones.

Conclusion: The study successfully benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions and demonstrates the feasibility of adaptive, user-aware AR systems. The work provides foundational insights for developing robust, context-sensitive text recognition systems for wearable devices and establishes a framework for future research in assistive and research-oriented applications.

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for
assistive and research-oriented applications, such as asset inspection and
nutrition analysis. The code is available at

### [39] [One Polyp Identifies All: One-Shot Polyp Segmentation with SAM via Cascaded Priors and Iterative Prompt Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16337)
*Xinyu Mao,Xiaohan Xing,Fei Meng,Jianbang Liu,Fan Bai,Qiang Nie,Max Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OP-SAM is a one-shot polyp segmentation framework that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image to enable accurate polyp segmentation without manual prompt input, achieving 76.93% IoU on Kvasir dataset and surpassing state-of-the-art by 11.44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polyp segmentation methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining and large-scale annotations. While SAM shows promise for polyp segmentation, its prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications due to labor-intensive manual prompt input requirements.

Method: The paper proposes OP-SAM with three key components: (1) Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer from a single annotated image, (2) Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations and filter noisy transfers, and (3) Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement instead of using all prompts simultaneously.

Result: OP-SAM achieves 76.93% IoU on the Kvasir dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate the framework's effectiveness in polyp segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: OP-SAM successfully addresses the automation limitation of SAM in medical applications by enabling accurate and generalizable polyp segmentation from just one annotated image, eliminating the need for manual prompt input while maintaining superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

*Mingtao Guo,Guanyu Xing,Yanci Zhang,Yanli Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRVD is a novel face reenactment framework that uses video diffusion models and a Warping Feature Mapper to generate high-quality talking head videos with large pose variations while preserving identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face reenactment methods struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts or limitations of coarse facial landmarks, failing to generate realistic talking head videos under extreme pose changes.

Method: The method employs a motion extractor for implicit facial keypoints, performs motion alignment through warping, and introduces a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps warped source images into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video model to correct warping degradation.

Result: FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations.

Conclusion: The Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by leveraging rich facial dynamics priors from large-scale video data, enabling high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose changes with enhanced temporal coherence.

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of online detection of take and release actions in untrimmed egocentric videos is challenging due to severe label imbalance with temporally sparse positive annotations, need for precise temporal predictions, and computational efficiency requirements for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose Mamba-OTR based on Mamba architecture that exploits temporal recurrence during inference while being trained on short video clips. The training pipeline incorporates focal loss and a novel regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric to address label imbalance.

Result: Mamba-OTR achieves 45.48 mp-mAP in sliding-window mode and 43.35 in streaming mode on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset, significantly outperforming vanilla transformer (20.32) and vanilla Mamba (25.16). The model demonstrates superiority in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly when evaluating full-length videos or high frame-rate sequences.

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR provides a strong baseline for online take and release detection, demonstrating that Mamba architecture can effectively handle temporal modeling in egocentric video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese License Plate Recognition faces challenges in unconstrained environments due to perspective distortions from various shooting angles and the complexity of single-line and double-line license plates. There's a need for low-complexity, end-to-end solutions suitable for edge devices with limited computational resources.

Method: The authors develop LPTR-AFLNet, which integrates a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized recognition network (AFLNet).

Result: LPTR-AFLNet demonstrates exceptional performance in correcting perspective distortion and recognizing double-line license plates across various challenging scenarios. The method achieves high recognition accuracy while running in less than 10 milliseconds on lower-mid-range GPU platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed LPTR-AFLNet successfully addresses the challenges of Chinese license plate recognition by providing an efficient, unified solution that maintains high accuracy while being suitable for real-time deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

*Kuo-Cheng Wu,Guohang Zhuang,Jinyang Huang,Xiang Zhang,Wanli Ouyang,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR, a large-scale astronomical super-resolution dataset with 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs, and proposes FISR model that outperforms existing methods by 24.84% on flux consistency metrics for astronomical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing astronomical super-resolution datasets suffer from three critical limitations: flux inconsistency, object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, which significantly impede the development of astronomical super-resolution methods needed for cost-effective high-resolution capture of celestial objects.

Method: The authors create STAR dataset using Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution observations paired with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated through a flux-preserving pipeline. They introduce a novel Flux Error (FE) metric for evaluation and propose the Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR) model that maintains flux consistency while performing super-resolution.

Result: STAR dataset contains 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide celestial regions. The FISR model suppresses several state-of-the-art super-resolution methods by 24.84% on the novel flux consistency metric, demonstrating superior performance for astrophysical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed STAR dataset and FISR model effectively address the limitations of existing astronomical super-resolution approaches. The flux-preserving methodology and comprehensive evaluation demonstrate the value of physically-informed super-resolution for astronomical imaging, with code and models made publicly available.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our
method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically-informed approach for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain fMRI data by using sphere tokenization, structural MRI integration, and positive-sample mixup to better preserve spatial brain structure and individual anatomical differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity ignore important brain structure-function relationships by flattening spatial information and neglecting individual anatomical variations, limiting reconstruction accuracy and biological interpretability.

Method: The authors propose three key innovations: (1) a sphere tokenizer that models fMRI signals as 2D spherical data on the cortical surface to preserve spatial coherence, (2) integration of structural MRI data to encode personalized anatomical variations, and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy to efficiently use multiple fMRI scans from the same visual stimulus.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved accuracy, biological interpretability, and generalizability across different individuals.

Conclusion: The biologically-informed approach successfully enhances visual stimulus reconstruction from brain activity by explicitly modeling cortical structure and individual anatomical differences, achieving better performance while maintaining biological plausibility and interpretability.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the
effectiveness and interpretability of our biologically informed approach.

### [45] [Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393)
*Lazaro Janier Gonzalez-Sole,Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot presentation attack detection (PAD) framework for face recognition systems using foundation models, which can detect unknown attacks without requiring training on attack data, outperforming existing methods on challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks (spoofing), and current deep learning PAD methods require large amounts of training data and lack generalizability to unknown attack types or databases not seen during training.

Method: The authors assess foundation models' effectiveness in PAD scenarios and propose a simple but effective zero-shot PAD framework that leverages these pre-trained models without requiring specific attack training data.

Result: Foundation models achieve competitive performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort compared to advanced PAD mechanisms trained on attack datasets. The top-performing foundation model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods using leave-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database containing challenging 2D and 3D attacks.

Conclusion: Foundation models can effectively perform zero-shot presentation attack detection, offering better generalizability and performance than traditional PAD approaches that require extensive training on attack data, particularly excelling in scenarios with unknown attack types.

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

*Kahim Wong,Jicheng Zhou,Haiwei Wu,Yain-Whar Si,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADCD-Net is a robust document forgery detection model that adaptively combines RGB/DCT forensic traces and uses hierarchical content disentanglement to improve localization of tampered regions in document images, achieving 20.79% better performance than existing methods across various distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detectors for natural images struggle with document images because tampered regions blend seamlessly into uniform backgrounds and structured text. Document-specific methods lack robustness against various degradations like resizing and cropping, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: The method introduces three key components: (1) adaptive modulation of DCT feature contribution based on predicted alignment scores to handle block misalignment sensitivity, (2) hierarchical content disentanglement to address text-background disparities, and (3) construction of pristine prototypes that capture traces of untampered regions to enhance accuracy.

Result: ADCD-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 20.79% averaged over 5 types of distortions, demonstrating superior forgery localization performance with improved resilience to various distortions including resizing and cropping.

Conclusion: The proposed ADCD-Net successfully addresses the challenges of document image forgery detection by adaptively leveraging forensic traces and incorporating document-specific characteristics, resulting in significantly improved robustness and localization accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

that ReasonVQA poses significant challenges to these models, highlighting its
potential for benchmarking and advancing the field of VQA. Additionally, our
dataset can be easily scaled with respect to input images; the current version

*Tanveer Younis,Zhanglin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey reviews recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction methods, comparing neural implicit models (NeRF variants), explicit point-cloud approaches (3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks using diffusion and vision foundation models to address challenges when minimal image overlap prevents traditional SfM/MVS methods from working.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods like structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS) fail in sparse-view scenarios with minimal image overlap, which are common in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems where dense image acquisition is impractical. There's a need to survey and unify the latest approaches that can handle these challenging conditions.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive survey analyzing three main categories of sparse-view 3D reconstruction approaches: (1) neural implicit models like NeRF and regularized versions, (2) explicit point-cloud-based methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting, and (3) hybrid frameworks leveraging priors from diffusion and vision foundation models. The analysis focuses on how these methods use geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference to address sparse-view challenges.

Result: Comparative analysis on standard benchmarks reveals key trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across different method categories. The survey identifies that geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are effective strategies for mitigating artifacts like floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: The survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative methods for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Key persistent challenges include domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction. Future directions should focus on developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

*Georg Siedel,Ekagra Gupta,Weijia Shao,Silvia Vock,Andrey Morozov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends adaptive label smoothing (soft augmentation) beyond random-crop to other aggressive augmentations like random erasing and noise injection, finding it effective for limited transformation types but harmful when applied with diverse augmentations like TrivialAugment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether adaptive label smoothing, which reduces label confidence based on augmentation magnitude and was previously limited to random-crop, can be effectively extended to other types of aggressive data augmentations in image classification.

Method: Extended the adaptive label smoothing framework to random erasing and noise injection augmentations, evaluating the method's effectiveness across different augmentation intensities and comparing performance with diverse augmentation strategies like TrivialAugment.

Result: Adaptive label smoothing enables stronger regularization with higher-intensity Random Erasing, but benefits disappear when used with diverse image transformations (TrivialAugment), and excessive label smoothing reduces robustness to common corruptions.

Conclusion: Adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when training data distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation types, as it becomes counterproductive with diverse augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

*Lin Xi,Yingliang Ma,Cheng Wang,Sandra Howell,Aldo Rinaldi,Kawal S. Rhode*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that uses prototype-based contrastive consistency to improve robustness against noisy pseudo-labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level medical image annotations are expensive and time-consuming, requiring clinical expert collaboration. Existing semi-supervised methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels that corrupt semantic distributions in latent space, limiting their effectiveness in leveraging abundant unlabeled data.

Method: A diffusion-based framework that enforces prototype-based contrastive consistency during the denoising diffusion process. The method uses class prototypes as centralized semantic anchors in latent space rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, improving robustness against noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches on EndoScapes2023 and the newly introduced MOSXAV datasets under semi-supervised learning settings. The approach demonstrates enhanced flexibility and data efficiency for clinical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based framework successfully addresses the challenges of semi-supervised medical image segmentation by improving robustness to noisy pseudo-labels through prototype-based contrastive consistency, offering a data-efficient solution with strong potential for diverse clinical applications.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

*Kai Deng,Zexin Ti,Jiawei Xu,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-Long is a system that enables foundation models to perform kilometer-scale monocular 3D reconstruction in outdoor environments by using chunk-based processing, overlapping alignment, and lightweight loop closure optimization without requiring camera calibration or depth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for 3D vision show great potential but face memory limitations when extending to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction, preventing their application to unbounded outdoor environments like those needed for autonomous driving.

Method: The paper proposes a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization to address scalability bottlenecks, enabling processing of long RGB sequences without camera calibration, depth supervision, or model retraining.

Result: VGGT-Long successfully processes long RGB sequences where foundation models typically fail, achieving trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets while producing accurate and consistent geometry across various conditions.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene reconstruction in real-world settings, particularly for autonomous driving scenarios, by overcoming memory limitations through efficient processing strategies.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

### [53] [DenseSR: Image Shadow Removal as Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16472)
*Yu-Fan Lin,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseSR proposes a dense prediction framework for single-image shadow removal that combines geometric-semantic priors for scene understanding with a novel Dense Fusion Block to achieve high-fidelity restoration while maintaining sharp boundaries and consistent appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-image shadow removal methods fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details and maintain sharp boundaries due to non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity, especially under challenging indirect illumination, resulting in inconsistent restoration and blurring that negatively affects downstream applications and viewing experience.

Method: The DenseSR framework employs two key strategies: (1) deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder that uses an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for fine textures and sharp boundaries.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DenseSR approach outperforms existing methods in shadow removal quality, successfully addressing the inconsistent restoration and blurring issues while preserving both consistency and fidelity in the restored images.

Conclusion: The DenseSR framework effectively tackles single-image shadow removal challenges by leveraging dense prediction perspective with geometric-semantic guidance and adaptive component processing, achieving superior restoration quality compared to traditional methods while maintaining sharp boundaries and consistent appearance.

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

*Ardhendu Sekhar,Vasu Soni,Keshav Aske,Garima Jain,Pranav Jeevan,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework for cancer survival prediction from pathology images that uses dynamic patch selection, graph-guided clustering, attention mechanisms, and mixture density modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance on renal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images lack accuracy and struggle with the large size of WSIs and complex survival distributions, necessitating a more sophisticated modular approach.

Method: A four-component framework: (1) dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding to identify prognostically informative tissue regions, (2) graph-guided k-means clustering for capturing phenotype-level heterogeneity, (3) attention mechanisms modeling intra- and inter-cluster relationships for contextualizing features, and (4) expert-guided mixture density modeling using Gaussian mixture models for survival distribution estimation.

Result: Achieved concordance index of 0.712±0.028 and Brier score of 0.254±0.018 on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and concordance index of 0.645±0.017 and Brier score of 0.281±0.031 on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework demonstrates superior predictive performance across diverse cancer types, proving the effectiveness of combining dynamic patch selection, spatial clustering, attention mechanisms, and mixture density modeling for cancer survival prediction from pathology images.

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv10 and SAM2 to remove background noise from herbarium images, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance (IoU 0.94, Dice 0.97) and improving botanical classification accuracy by up to 4.36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning classification of herbarium images suffers from background heterogeneity that introduces noise and artifacts, misleading models and reducing classification accuracy. Addressing these background-related challenges is critical for improving model performance in botanical image analysis.

Method: The authors developed PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, and both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images. Performance was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.

Result: PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance with an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. When segmented images were incorporated into classification models, consistent performance improvements were observed across five tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that background removal through automated segmentation significantly enhances herbarium image classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on foreground plant structures. PlantSAM provides an effective solution for addressing background heterogeneity challenges in botanical image analysis.

*Xiuwei Chen,Wentao Hu,Hanhui Li,Jun Zhou,Zisheng Chen,Meng Cao,Yihan Zeng,Kui Zhang,Yu-Jie Yuan,Jianhua Han,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C2-Evo is a closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities for multimodal large language models, addressing data complexity mismatches and model-task difficulty misalignment through cross-modal data evolution and adaptive problem selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs require high-quality vision-language datasets with curated task complexities that are costly to scale. Current self-improving methods have two key issues: (1) visual and textual data are augmented separately, causing complexity discrepancies, and (2) data and model evolution are separated, leading to mismatched difficulty levels between models and tasks.

Method: C2-Evo employs two evolution loops: (1) a cross-modal data evolution loop that generates complex multimodal problems combining structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, and (2) a data-model evolution loop that adaptively selects generated problems based on base model performance and conducts alternating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The method continuously refines both model and training data, achieving considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through the joint evolution approach.

Conclusion: C2-Evo successfully addresses the core challenges in MLLM improvement by implementing an automatic, closed-loop framework that synchronously evolves data complexity and model capabilities, demonstrating effective performance enhancement in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

*Xiaoyan Wang,Zeju Li,Yifan Xu,Jiaxing Qi,Zhifei Yang,Ruifei Ma,Xiangde Liu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatial 3D-LLM, a multimodal large language model that enhances spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks through progressive spatial embedding enrichment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D multimodal LLMs have limited spatial awareness because they rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects, which provides insufficient representation of the spatial richness inherent in 3D scenes.

Method: The authors develop Spatial 3D-LLM by integrating an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings as visual prompts. They also introduce two novel tasks (3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing) and construct a 3D instruction dataset called MODEL.

Result: Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, demonstrating that the improvements stem from the progressive spatial awareness scheme's ability to mine more profound spatial information.

Conclusion: The progressive spatial awareness scheme effectively enhances spatial understanding in 3D vision-language tasks by enriching spatial embeddings, leading to superior performance compared to existing approaches that compress or segment 3D scene information.

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

*Shang Liu,Chenjie Cao,Chaohui Yu,Wen Qian,Jing Wang,Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EarthCrafter, a framework for large-scale 3D Earth surface generation using a new 50k scene aerial dataset (Aerial-Earth3D) and sparse-decoupled latent diffusion that separates structural and textural generation to model thousands of square kilometers efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods cannot scale to geographic extents like modeling thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface, which is needed for large-scale terrain and urban layout generation applications.

Method: The approach combines two innovations: (1) Aerial-Earth3D dataset with 50k curated 600m×600m scenes from U.S. mainland containing 45M multi-view Google Earth frames with pose annotations, depth maps, normals, and semantic segmentation; (2) EarthCrafter framework using dual sparse 3D-VAEs to compress geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats into compact latent spaces, plus condition-aware flow matching models for independent geometry and texture generation.

Result: EarthCrafter demonstrates substantially better performance in extremely large-scale generation compared to existing methods, while supporting versatile applications including semantic-guided urban layout generation and unconditional terrain synthesis with maintained geographic plausibility.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of scaling 3D generation to geographic extents through innovative data infrastructure and model architecture that separates structural and textural generation, enabling efficient large-scale Earth surface modeling while preserving critical information and geographic realism.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

*Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa,Koldo Basterretxea,Javier Echanobe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents optimization techniques for deploying DNN-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation on FPGA-based SoCs for autonomous driving systems, achieving significant model compression and speed improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical autonomous driving systems require HSI-based vision systems with strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security. Traditional DNN models are over-parameterized and computationally intensive, making real-time edge deployment challenging. Additionally, HSI data preprocessing requirements are often overlooked but critical for efficient pipeline design on SoCs.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive software/hardware co-design approach including: (1) functional software/hardware task distribution, (2) hardware-aware preprocessing optimization, (3) ML model compression techniques, and (4) complete pipelined deployment on FPGA-based SoC platforms. The method focuses on optimizing memory arrangement and inter-task communication for HSI data processing.

Result: The compression techniques reduced DNN complexity to 24.34% of original operations and 1.02% of original parameters. This achieved a 2.86x speed-up in inference tasks without noticeable degradation in segmentation accuracy, enabling practical real-time deployment on edge platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization framework successfully enables practical deployment of DNN-based HSI segmentation systems on resource-constrained FPGA-based SoCs for autonomous driving applications. The significant reduction in computational complexity while maintaining accuracy demonstrates the viability of HSI vision systems for safety-critical edge applications.

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PhaKIR sub-challenge at MICCAI 2024, providing a novel multi-center dataset of 13 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos with unified annotations for surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation to advance temporally aware, context-driven methods in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery applications, but robust performance under real-world conditions remains challenging. Incorporating surgical context like procedural phases could improve robustness and interpretability, but existing datasets don't enable joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context.

Method: The authors organized the PhaKIR sub-challenge and created a novel multi-center dataset comprising 13 full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three medical institutions. The dataset includes unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation, enabling temporal information integration across entire procedures.

Result: The paper reports results and findings following BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The dataset successfully enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting temporal information integration across complete surgical procedures.

Conclusion: The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,

Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets when treating detection as classification or requiring precise temporal annotations for forgery localization.

Method: Proposes MDP framework with: (1) Multimodal interaction mechanism using temporal property preserving cross-modal attention between visual and audio modalities in probabilistic embedding space, and (2) Extensible deviation perceiving loss that enlarges deviation between adjacent segments in forged samples while reducing it in genuine samples.

Result: Achieves comparable results to fully-supervised approaches across several evaluation metrics while requiring only video-level annotations instead of precise temporal labels.

Conclusion: The proposed MDP framework effectively performs weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization by leveraging multimodal deviation perception, demonstrating that video-level supervision can achieve performance comparable to methods requiring detailed temporal annotations.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

*Xueming Fu,Pei Wu,Yingtai Li,Xin Luo,Zihang Jiang,Junhao Mei,Jian Lu,Gao-Jun Teng,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dyna3DGR, a novel framework combining 3D Gaussian representation with neural motion field modeling for accurate cardiac motion tracking in 4D cardiac MRI, achieving superior performance over existing deep learning methods without requiring extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion tracking methods face significant limitations: image-based approaches struggle with topological consistency or require extensive training data, while representation-based methods lose important image-level details. The homogeneous nature of myocardial tissue and lack of distinctive features make fine-grained 4D cardiac motion tracking particularly challenging.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation (Dyna3DGR), which combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling. The method uses differentiable volumetric rendering to bridge continuous motion representation with image-space alignment, simultaneously optimizing cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner without requiring point-to-point correspondences.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC dataset show that Dyna3DGR surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy while preserving both topological and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Dyna3DGR successfully addresses the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking approaches by providing a self-supervised framework that maintains topological and temporal consistency without requiring extensive training data, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

*Haoyang Su,Shaohao Rui,Jinyi Xiang,Lianming Wu,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTSL, a self-supervised framework that predicts Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences without requiring manual segmentation masks, using codebook-based temporal-spatial learning to capture motion patterns and achieve better performance than traditional contrast-dependent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MACE prediction methods require supervised learning with human-refined masks in ventricular myocardium and contrast agents, which becomes impractical in contrast-free scenarios. There is a critical need for accurate, non-invasive cardiac risk assessment that doesn't rely on contrast agents or manual segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), a self-supervised framework that: (1) decouples temporal and spatial features through multi-view distillation where teacher models process multiple Cine views and student models learn from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences, (2) uses codebook-based feature representations, and (3) performs dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues to capture temporal dependencies and motion patterns.

Result: CTSL achieves high-confidence MACE risk predictions and outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods. The framework provides rapid, non-invasive cardiac risk assessment from raw Cine MRI data without requiring segmentation masks or contrast agents.

Conclusion: The proposed CTSL framework enables timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings by providing accurate MACE prediction from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences, eliminating the need for contrast agents and manual segmentation while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: ASaRG extends LLaVA architecture for clinical report generation by incorporating intermediate features and segmentation maps from specialist radiological models, achieving significant performance improvements while providing grounding capabilities for clinical verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical report generation models need strong general performance and grounding capabilities to convince clinicians and patients of generated report veracity, while alleviating radiologists' workloads and providing second opinions.

Method: ASaRG fuses intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps from specialist radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple concatenation, with minimal parameter addition.

Result: Achieved +0.89% CE F1 score improvement with intermediate features only (p=0.012) and +2.77% with combined features and segmentation maps (p<0.001) compared to LLaVA baseline. Outperformed COMG and ORID by 6.98% and 6.28% F1 score respectively.

Conclusion: ASaRG successfully enhances clinical report generation performance while enabling traceability between report elements and segmentation maps for verification. The method is compatible with other LLaVA architecture improvements and demonstrates the value of incorporating specialist radiological model outputs.

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

### [65] [A2Mamba: Attention-augmented State Space Models for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16624)
*Meng Lou,Yunxiang Fu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A2Mamba introduces a novel Transformer-Mamba hybrid architecture with Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS) that deeply integrates attention mechanisms with Mamba layers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across visual recognition tasks including ImageNet classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that combine Transformers and Mamba for visual recognition simply stack layers without interaction mechanisms, leaving deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers as an unsolved problem. The authors aim to create a more effective hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: The paper proposes A2Mamba, featuring a Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS) token mixer. The key innovation is A2SSM, which performs cross-attention by spatially aggregating SSM's hidden states using multi-scale attention maps, enhancing spatial dependencies in 2D space while improving SSM's dynamic modeling capabilities.

Result: A2Mamba achieves superior performance across multiple tasks: A2Mamba-L reaches 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, A2Mamba-B outperforms CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% mIoU in semantic segmentation with higher efficiency, and A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in object detection/instance segmentation while using 40% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: A2Mamba successfully addresses the limitation of shallow integration in existing Transformer-Mamba hybrids by introducing deep interaction mechanisms through attention-augmented state space models, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across visual recognition tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

### [66] [Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639)
*Jonathan Henrich,Christian Post,Maximilian Zilke,Parth Shiroya,Emma Chanut,Amir Mollazadeh Yamchi,Ramin Yahyapour,Thomas Kneib,Imke Traulsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic benchmarking study for pig detection and tracking in farm environments, introducing two datasets (PigDetect and PigTrack) and comparing various machine learning approaches for automated pig monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual monitoring of individual pig behavior is labor-intensive and inefficient. While machine learning advances enable automated monitoring through object detection and multi-object tracking, there has been no systematic benchmarking study to evaluate different approaches for pig farming applications, creating a knowledge gap in the field.

Method: The authors curated two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking, using diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions with challenging scenarios. They compared state-of-the-art detection models against real-time alternatives, and evaluated SORT-based tracking methods versus end-to-end trainable models. They also analyzed the impact of challenging training images on detection performance.

Result: State-of-the-art detection models significantly outperformed real-time alternatives in detection quality. Challenging training images improved detection performance beyond random sampling. For tracking, SORT-based methods achieved superior detection performance while end-to-end models showed better association performance. Both detection and tracking models demonstrated good generalization to unseen pens, indicating effective training data quality.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for pig monitoring systems, showing that high-quality training data is crucial for good generalization. While current SORT-based tracking methods are superior overall, end-to-end models show promise for future development due to better association capabilities. The publicly available datasets and code will facilitate further research and development in automated pig farming monitoring.

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

*Shuang Song,Yang Tang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to improve building segmentation in remote sensing by re-training models at test time using synthetic data that replicates the target region's urban structure, achieving up to 12% performance improvements without requiring extensive real-world annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for building segmentation struggle to generalize across diverse geographic regions due to variations in city layouts, building types, sizes, and locations. The time-consuming process of creating annotated data for worldwide diversity cannot keep pace with increasingly data-hungry models, creating a need for alternative training approaches.

Method: The approach re-trains models at test time using geo-typical synthetic data generated from geospatial information like OpenStreetMap street networks. It employs procedural modeling and physics-based rendering to create high-resolution synthetic images with domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and environmental illumination. The synthetic data is integrated into an adversarial domain adaptation framework to overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps.

Result: Experiments show significant performance enhancements with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. The method successfully generates virtually unlimited training samples that maintain essential characteristics of target environments while providing a scalable and cost-effective solution.

Conclusion: This scalable and cost-effective method successfully blends partial geographic knowledge with synthetic imagery, offering a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue in purely synthetic datasets and providing a practical pathway to improve generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without requiring extensive real-world annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

*Sos Agaian,Vladimir Frants*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quaternion Retinex, a novel image enhancement method for low-light images that uses quaternion mathematics to decompose images into reflectance and illumination components, achieving 2-11% performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from color shift, low contrast, and noise that hurt computer vision accuracy. Classic Retinex models have four key limitations: treating RGB channels independently, lacking neuroscientific color vision models, inability to perfectly reconstruct input images, and failure to explain human color constancy.

Method: The paper proposes the first Quaternion Retinex formulation where the scene is represented as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and illumination. They also introduce the Reflectance Consistency Index to measure how well reflectance remains invariant across different lighting conditions.

Result: Tests on low-light crack inspection, face detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion demonstrate 2-11% performance gains over leading methods, with improved color fidelity, reduced noise, and higher reflectance stability.

Conclusion: The Quaternion Retinex approach successfully addresses the limitations of classical Retinex models by leveraging quaternion mathematics, providing a more robust solution for low-light image enhancement with measurable improvements in multiple computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

*Yiguo He,Junjie Zhu,Yiying Li,Xiaoyu Zhang,Chunping Qiu,Jun Wang,Qiangjuan Huang,Ke Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MpGI, a two-stage method for generating high-quality captions for remote sensing images, creating the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with 210K images and 1.3M captions, and demonstrates superior performance with HQRS-CLIP using only 4.2% of typical training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of applying Vision-Language Foundation Models to remote sensing imagery is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale image-text paired training data. Existing datasets suffer from suboptimal quality due to rudimentary caption generation methods, requiring larger training volumes while only achieving modest performance improvements.

Method: The paper proposes MpGI (Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration), a two-stage approach: (1) Generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods, (2) Utilize Large Language Models to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions that capture multi-perspective details. This creates the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with ~210K RS images and 1.3M captions.

Result: The fine-tuned HQRS-CLIP model surpassed previous state-of-the-art RS CLIP models in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperformed other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and generated captions that rival or exceed manual annotations for remote sensing images.

Conclusion: The MpGI method successfully addresses the data quality challenge in remote sensing vision-language models by generating high-quality multi-perspective captions. The resulting models achieve superior performance with significantly less training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of quality over quantity in dataset construction for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

### [70] [Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718)
*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Chenxiao Fan,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a new task that enables models to segment objects in videos based on natural language queries while understanding when objects become contextually relevant over time, with applications in surgical video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video segmentation methods are limited to predefined object categories and cannot handle out-of-vocabulary objects or complex text queries. Existing video reasoning segmentation assumes target objects remain relevant throughout entire videos, which is inadequate for real-world scenarios like surgical procedures where objects appear, disappear, or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context.

Method: The authors propose temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries incorporating temporal reasoning. They develop an innovative automated benchmark construction method to avoid expensive manual annotation and create the TCVideoRSBenchmark dataset.

Result: The paper presents TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation dataset containing 52 samples using videos from the MVOR dataset, demonstrating the feasibility of automated benchmark construction for this new task formulation.

Conclusion: The work successfully establishes temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation as a novel task formulation that addresses limitations of existing approaches, particularly for complex scenarios like surgical video analysis where object relevance changes dynamically over time, supported by an automated dataset construction methodology.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

TL;DR: HarmonPaint is a training-free inpainting framework that integrates with diffusion model attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality, harmonized image inpainting without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods require extensive retraining or fine-tuning to integrate new content and struggle to maintain coherence in both structure and style between inpainted regions and surrounding background.

Method: The framework leverages masking strategies within self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models and exploits intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions, ensuring both structural fidelity and harmonious style integration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across diverse scenes and styles, validating the framework's versatility and performance in achieving high-quality harmonized inpainting.

Conclusion: HarmonPaint successfully addresses the limitations of existing inpainting methods by providing a training-free solution that maintains both structural and stylistic coherence in image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Xiwei Zhang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFR is a novel few-shot segmentation framework that integrates visual, textual, and audio modalities using SAM to overcome limitations of single/dual-modal approaches through decomposition, contrastive fusion, and dual-path reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation approaches rely on single or dual-modal paradigms (visual support samples or textual descriptions) which limit exploitation of rich perceptual information available in real-world scenarios, necessitating a multi-modal approach for enhanced semantic understanding.

Method: The DFR framework consists of three components: 1) Multi-modal Decompose - hierarchical decomposition using SAM for visual regions, expanding textual semantics, and processing audio features; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse - contrastive learning fusion strategy across three modalities; 3) Dual-path Reconstruct - adaptive integration combining semantic guidance from tri-modal tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.

Result: Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both synthetic and real settings demonstrate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The DFR framework successfully addresses the challenge of multi-modal guidance utilization in few-shot segmentation by systematically integrating three modalities, achieving superior performance compared to existing single/dual-modal approaches through its decompose-fuse-reconstruct paradigm.

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

*Keneni W. Tesema,Lyndon Hill,Mark W. Jones,Gary K. L. Tam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DWCNet, a robust point cloud completion network that simultaneously denoises and completes highly corrupted partial point clouds, along with a new benchmark dataset CPCCD for evaluating robustness against various corruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion networks trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world degradations including noise and occlusions. There is a need for methods that can handle multiple simultaneous corruptions in partial point clouds from real-world environments used in autonomous driving, AR, and robotics.

Method: The authors propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing Network) with a Noise Management Module (NMM) that uses contrastive learning and self-attention mechanisms to suppress noise while modeling structural relationships. They also introduce CPCCD dataset to benchmark robustness against diverse corruptions.

Result: DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both clean and corrupted point clouds across synthetic and real-world datasets. The CPCCD benchmark reveals limitations of current methods under various corruption types.

Conclusion: DWCNet successfully addresses the challenge of completing highly corrupted partial point clouds by jointly performing denoising and completion. The proposed method demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing approaches, and the new benchmark dataset provides a valuable evaluation framework for future research.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and

*Ang Li,Charles Wang,Kaiyu Yue,Zikui Cai,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Peng Guo,Wang Bill Zhu,Vatsal Sharan,Robin Jia,Willie Neiswanger,Furong Huang,Tom Goldstein,Micah Goldblum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zebra-CoT, a large-scale dataset of 182,384 samples containing interleaved text-image reasoning traces to train multimodal models for Visual Chain of Thought reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements on visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with Visual Chain of Thought reasoning due to poor off-the-shelf performance that hinders reinforcement learning and the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. Humans naturally use visual aids like diagrams when solving complex problems, so training models to do the same is valuable.

Method: The authors created Zebra-CoT, a diverse dataset with logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces across four task categories: scientific questions (geometry, physics, algorithms), 2D visual reasoning (visual search, jigsaw puzzles), 3D reasoning (multi-hop inference, embodied/robot planning), and visual logic problems (chess, strategic games). They fine-tuned models like Anole-7B and Bagel-7B on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning Anole-7B on Zebra-CoT achieved +12% improvement in test-set accuracy and up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B produced a model capable of generating high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains.

Conclusion: Zebra-CoT effectively enables the development of multimodal reasoning abilities in language models. The dataset and models are open-sourced to support further development and evaluation of visual Chain of Thought reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Chunjin Yang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.8% and 74.5% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation faces challenges due to limited data and domain shifts. While SAM shows promising zero-shot capabilities, it has two critical limitations: reliance on manual prompts and limited cross-domain ability, making direct adaptation to CD-FSS problematic.

Method: The paper introduces the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework with three key modules: (1) Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (2) Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (3) Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation.

Result: The CMP framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across four cross-domain datasets, with 71.8% mIoU in 1-shot scenarios and 74.5% mIoU in 5-shot scenarios, demonstrating superior cross-domain few-shot segmentation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed CMP framework successfully addresses the key challenges of adapting SAM to cross-domain few-shot segmentation by eliminating manual prompt dependency and enhancing cross-domain generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in this challenging task.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four
cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving
71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.

### [76] [Faithful, Interpretable Chest X-ray Diagnosis with Anti-Aliased B-cos Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16761)
*Marcel Kleinmann,Shashank Agnihotri,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves B-cos networks for medical imaging by introducing anti-aliasing techniques (FLCPooling and BlurPool) to eliminate explanation artifacts and extending the framework to support multi-label classification, making them suitable for clinical chest X-ray analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard B-cos networks produce inherently interpretable explanations but suffer from severe aliasing artifacts that make them unsuitable for clinical use. Additionally, the original B-cos formulation only supports multi-class settings, while medical applications like chest X-ray analysis often require multi-label classification for co-occurring abnormalities.

Method: The authors introduce two anti-aliasing strategies: FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to improve explanation quality and eliminate artifacts. They also extend the B-cos network architecture to support multi-label classification, creating modified B-cos_FLC and B-cos_BP variants.

Result: The modified B-cos networks (B-cos_FLC and B-cos_BP) maintain strong predictive performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs while providing faithful and artifact-free explanations. The networks successfully handle multi-label classification tasks on chest X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced B-cos networks with anti-aliasing techniques and multi-label support provide a viable solution for deploying interpretable deep learning models in clinical settings, offering clear explanations suitable for medical imaging applications without sacrificing diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

### [77] [Task-Specific Zero-shot Quantization-Aware Training for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16782)
*Changhao Li,Xinrui Chen,Ji Wang,Kang Zhao,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel zero-shot quantization framework for object detection that generates task-specific synthetic data without requiring original training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance through bounding box sampling and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantization methods require access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy and security concerns. Existing zero-shot quantization methods for object detection use generic synthetic images that lack task-specific information, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize task-specific calibration data from pre-trained networks, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions; (2) integrating task-specific training into knowledge distillation to restore quantized network performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to existing zero-shot quantization approaches for object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed task-specific zero-shot quantization framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by generating more relevant synthetic data for object detection, achieving superior performance without requiring access to original training data.

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

### [78] [Enhancing Domain Diversity in Synthetic Data Face Recognition with Dataset Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16790)
*Anjith George,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining two different synthetic face datasets to improve face recognition model performance while addressing privacy concerns from using real-world data without consent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition datasets are often collected without user consent, raising ethical and privacy issues. While synthetic data offers a solution, models trained on synthetic data typically underperform due to single generator limitations that introduce model-specific artifacts and biases.

Method: The authors combine two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets generated using architecturally distinct backbones to reduce model-specific artifacts, enhance diversity in pose/lighting/demographics, and provide implicit regularization by emphasizing identity-relevant features.

Result: Models trained on the combined synthetic dataset achieved superior performance across many standard face recognition benchmarks compared to models trained on individual synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Combining multiple synthetic face datasets from different generators effectively reduces artifacts and biases, leading to improved face recognition performance while maintaining ethical data practices.

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

### [79] [HOComp: Interaction-Aware Human-Object Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16813)
*Dong Liang,Jinyuan Jia,Yuhao Liu,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOComp is a novel approach for compositing foreground objects onto human-centric background images while ensuring natural human-object interactions and consistent appearances, using MLLMs-driven pose guidance and detail-consistent appearance preservation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-guided composition methods struggle to synthesize seamless interaction-aware compositions when involving human-object interactions, often failing to achieve natural blending and harmonious interactions between foreground objects and background humans.

Method: The approach consists of two key components: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG) that uses MLLMs to identify interaction regions and types while incorporating human pose landmarks for coarse-to-fine pose constraints, and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP) that unifies shape-aware attention modulation, multi-view appearance loss, and background consistency loss to maintain consistent shapes/textures and faithful background reproduction.

Result: HOComp effectively generates harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances and outperforms relevant methods both qualitatively and quantitatively on the newly proposed IHOC dataset, demonstrating superior performance in interaction-aware composition tasks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of human-object interaction composition by introducing HOComp with its novel MRPG and DCAP components, along with the first dataset for interaction-aware human-object composition, achieving significant improvements over existing methods in generating natural and consistent human-object interactions.

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Chi-Pin Huang,Yueh-Hua Wu,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Fu-En Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkAct is a dual-system framework for vision-language-action tasks that separates high-level reasoning from low-level action execution, using a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans that are compressed into visual plan latents to guide robust action execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models train end-to-end without explicit reasoning, which limits their ability to perform multi-step planning and adapt to complex task variations in dynamic environments requiring multimodal instruction interpretation and long-horizon planning.

Method: A dual-system framework that trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans using reinforced visual latent planning with action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency, then compresses these plans into visual plan latents that condition a downstream action model.

Result: Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks show ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Conclusion: ThinkAct successfully bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution through reinforced visual latent planning, demonstrating improved performance in complex embodied AI tasks requiring adaptive planning and execution.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.
