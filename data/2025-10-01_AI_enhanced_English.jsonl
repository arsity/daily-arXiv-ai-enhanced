We contend that in\ncurrent unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative\nreasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image\nreferring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is\nintrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we\nintroduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion\nmodel via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained\nimage conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the\ncomplex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while\nreserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve\nthis, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect\nthe VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to\nunleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a\nlarge, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.\nFinally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and\nperform instruction tuning on downstream tasks.
