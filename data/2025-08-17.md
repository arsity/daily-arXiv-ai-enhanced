### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF improves few-shot learning for food images by filtering patch embeddings based on class correlation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images' complexity and variability cause misclassification in few-shot learning due to irrelevant patches.

Method: Stochastic-based Patch Filtering (SPFF) discards less similar patches and uses a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF outperforms existing methods on Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPFF effectively focuses on relevant food features, improving few-shot classification accuracy.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 introduces a self-supervised vision foundation model using scaling, Gram anchoring, and post-hoc strategies to outperform specialized models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate manual data annotation and enable scalable, versatile visual representation learning across diverse domains.

Method: Scales dataset and model size, introduces Gram anchoring to prevent feature degradation, and applies post-hoc strategies for flexibility.

Result: DINOv3 outperforms state-of-the-art models in various vision tasks without fine-tuning, producing high-quality dense features.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning, offering scalable solutions for diverse tasks and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

### [3] [Empowering Morphing Attack Detection using Interpretable Image-Text Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10110)
*Sushrut Patwardhan,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Sushma Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal learning approach for morphing attack detection in face recognition systems, using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation and textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of face recognition systems by detecting morphing attacks and providing human-understandable textual descriptions.

Method: Uses Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for zero-shot evaluation, with engineered textual prompts (short and long) for morphing attack detection.

Result: The framework generalizes well for morphing attack detection and predicts relevant text snippets, evaluated on a dataset with five morphing techniques across three mediums.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach is effective for morphing attack detection and textual description, outperforming SOTA pre-trained networks in zero-shot evaluation.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models, combining radical and pictographic analysis to improve generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for OBS decipherment lack interpretability and struggle with generalization, especially for zero-shot and undeciphered cases.

Method: The approach uses a progressive training strategy for radical and pictographic analysis, along with a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism, and introduces a new dataset (Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot performance, providing logical analysis for undeciphered OBS.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers archaeologically valuable insights and has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans is developed and validated, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating value for shape and appearance modeling in health research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans for body composition assessment, enabling large-scale shape and appearance modeling.

Method: A deep learning approach is trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and validated for accuracy. The method is then applied to 35,928 scans across five imaging modes for shape and appearance modeling.

Result: The method achieves 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement and successfully associates SAM features with health biomarkers, corroborating existing evidence and generating new hypotheses.

Conclusion: The developed method is highly accurate and valuable for large-scale health research, with open-source tools provided for further use.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANGO, a Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow method, to improve interpretability and performance in multimodal fusion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion methods lack interpretability and struggle with complex correlations, prompting the need for explicit and tractable fusion learning.

Method: Proposes an Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three cross-attention mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA) within a Normalizing Flow framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification.

Conclusion: MANGO provides a scalable, interpretable solution for multimodal fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining real and synthetic images improves crop disease classification accuracy, outperforming models trained on only real or synthetic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating real and synthetic images for enhancing disease classification in agriculture, addressing the gap in research on hybrid datasets.

Method: Used an EfficientNetV2-L model with five treatments: H0 (real only), H1 (synthetic only), H2 (1:1 real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images).

Result: Models with hybrid datasets (H2-H4) achieved higher precision, recall, and F1-scores, with H3-H4 reaching a weighted F1-score of 1.00.

Conclusion: Hybrid datasets combining real and synthetic images maximize model performance, proving synthetic images alone are insufficient for crop disease classification.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic data generation framework to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and object detectors for rare, safety-critical tasks like industrial spill detection, where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance of VLMs degrades in niche, safety-critical domains due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and infrequent incidents, making conventional fine-tuning impractical.

Method: A scalable framework with a synthetic data generation pipeline (SynSpill dataset) is proposed for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and object detectors like YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data boosts performance of VLMs and detectors, making them comparable. VLMs generalize better without synthetic data, but both improve significantly with it.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data bridges domain gaps in safety-critical applications, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for vision systems in data-scarce industrial settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) requires compression for storage/transmission. EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method, reduces data rates by 30x while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient storage/transmission of 3DGS Gaussian attributes due to their separation in tasks and devices.

Method: Statistical analysis of Gaussian attributes, revealing Laplace and Gaussian distributions, followed by a factorized entropy coding method (EntropyGS) with adaptive quantization.

Result: 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets with similar rendering quality and fast encoding/decoding.

Conclusion: EntropyGS effectively compresses 3DGS data without compromising visual quality, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

*Paul H. Acosta,Pingjun Chen,Simon P. Castillo,Maria Esther Salvatierra,Yinyin Yuan,Xiaoxi Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellSymphony integrates Xenium spatial transcriptomics and histology images using foundation models for accurate cell type annotation and microenvironment analysis in tumors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of extracting robust cell-level features from histology images and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data drives the need for a multimodal solution.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-derived embeddings to fuse spatial gene expression with morphological context at single-cell resolution.

Result: The framework achieves precise cell type annotation and identifies distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Foundation models and multimodal fusion hold promise for understanding cell orchestration in complex tissues.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews trends in deep learning for crack detection, highlighting shifts in learning paradigms, generalizability, and dataset diversity. It introduces a new dataset, 3DCrack, and benchmarks deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze emerging trends in deep learning for crack detection and provide a comprehensive review with a new dataset and benchmarks.

Method: Systematic review of trends and benchmarking experiments using the new 3DCrack dataset.

Result: Insights into evolving methodologies and future directions in deep learning-based crack detection.

Conclusion: The paper offers a thorough analysis of current trends and sets baselines for future research with the 3DCrack dataset.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

### [12] [MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD is a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by fusing multi-region predictions using JSD-based weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce text inconsistent with visual input due to limited verification ability.

Method: MRFD uses cross-attention to identify salient regions, generates per-region responses, weights them via JSD, and fuses predictions with region-aware prompts.

Result: MRFD reduces hallucinations and improves factuality across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MRFD effectively enhances factual grounding in LVLMs without requiring model updates.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [13] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing appearance-based PoG estimation across individuals by proposing a dynamic calibration strategy that improves robustness to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person-specific calibration is needed for accurate PoG estimation, but current methods are sensitive to head pose changes.

Method: The authors create a benchmark (MobilePoG) and analyze calibration point and head pose diversity. They propose a dynamic calibration strategy involving head movement.

Result: Calibration with varied head poses improves estimator robustness. The dynamic strategy outperforms conventional methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic calibration strategy enhances PoG estimation accuracy by reducing sensitivity to head pose variations.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [14] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method improves text-driven image generation by combining contrastive learning and structural guidance, enhancing semantic alignment and structural consistency without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in semantic alignment and structural consistency in existing text-driven image generation methods.

Method: Integrates text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance, using contrastive learning and structural priors (e.g., layout maps or edge sketches) to guide generation. Jointly optimizes multiple losses (contrastive, structural consistency, semantic preservation).

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on COCO-2014 in CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, showing improved semantic clarity and structural completeness.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances semantic alignment and structural fidelity, providing a viable solution for text-image modeling and generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

### [15] [VIFSS: View-Invariant and Figure Skating-Specific Pose Representation Learning for Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10281)
*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) framework for figure skating jumps, addressing data insufficiency and 3D procedural challenges with a view-invariant pose representation and fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recognition of figure skating jumps is crucial for performance evaluation but requires expert knowledge. Existing TAS methods lack sufficient data and ignore 3D aspects and procedural structure.

Method: Introduces a View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific (VIFSS) pose representation with contrastive pre-training and action classification fine-tuning. Uses FS-Jump3D dataset and fine-grained annotations for procedural learning.

Result: Achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, recognizing jump types and rotation levels. View-invariant pre-training excels with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses TAS limitations for figure skating, combining 3D and procedural insights, with practical applicability in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

*Simindokht Jahangard,Mehrzad Mohammadi,Yi Shen,Zhixi Cai,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by formalizing reasoning complexity and providing customizable questions with detailed annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning benchmarks lack clear definitions of reasoning complexity, customizable question generation, and structured reasoning annotations, limiting their utility for embodied AI agents.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity, develop an adaptive query engine for generating customizable questions with intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning is created as a tailored benchmark, enabling fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of VLMs across reasoning levels.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and engine address gaps in visual reasoning evaluation, offering a more structured and adaptable approach for assessing AI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a PCWLAD method for high-accuracy multimodal optical image matching, outperforming existing methods with ~0.4 pixel accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing degraded matching accuracy due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences in multimodal images.

Method: Combines coarse matching (SSIM) and fine matching (WLAD) with phase consistency and mutual structure filtering.

Result: Achieves ~0.4 pixel accuracy, outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods in CMR and RMSE.

Conclusion: PCWLAD is effective for multimodal image matching, with publicly available software and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterSyn introduces a framework for realistic motion synthesis by interleaving solo and multi-person dynamics, achieving better alignment and diversity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately, aiming for more natural and coordinated motion synthesis.

Method: Uses an interleaved learning strategy with two modules: INS for joint modeling of solo and interactive behaviors, and REC for refining mutual dynamics and synchronization.

Result: Generates motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity, outperforming recent methods.

Conclusion: InterSyn sets a new benchmark for robust and natural motion synthesis, with plans to open-source the code for further research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for precise OoD object localization in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where conventional OoD detection lacks spatial granularity.

Method: Categorizes OoD segmentation approaches into four groups: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models.

Result: Systematic review of recent advances, identification of challenges, and discussion of future research directions in OoD segmentation.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is vital for autonomous driving, and ongoing research is needed to address emerging challenges and improve robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism due to surrogate objectives like likelihood or reconstruction loss. RL offers a principled framework to address these issues.

Method: The paper reviews RL's evolution from classical control to its use as a general-purpose optimization tool in image, video, and 3D/4D generation. It examines RL's integration as both a fine-tuning mechanism and structural component.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in generative tasks across various domains.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges and future research directions for RL in generative modeling.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted training data selection method for vision-language instruction tuning, optimizing performance by matching benchmark needs to either skills or concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, where performance depends on training with similar skills or concepts, the paper aims to improve benchmark-specific outcomes.

Method: The method involves extracting concepts/skills from benchmarks, identifying their primary benefit (skills or concepts), and selecting matching instructions.

Result: Experiments show +0.9% improvement over baselines overall and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-off in instruction selection between conceptual knowledge and visual skills, advocating for targeted data selection.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Glo-DMU is a deep learning framework for automated, high-precision analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases, addressing practical diagnostic needs by quantifying multiple features simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on individual ultrastructure recognition, which is insufficient for practical diagnostic needs in kidney diseases.

Method: Glo-DMU uses three deep models for ultrastructure segmentation, glomerular filtration barrier classification, and electron-dense deposit detection, quantifying key ultrastructural features.

Result: Evaluated on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed good consistency with pathological reports, demonstrating automation, precision, and throughput.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU provides an efficient tool for renal pathologists by automating and enhancing the quantification of multiple ultrastructural features.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

### [24] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM data, enabling interpretable atomic-resolution dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to entangled degradation effects like spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, which distort geometry and intensity.

Method: AtomDiffuser uses a time-aware degradation modeling framework to predict affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames, leveraging degradation as a temporally conditioned process.

Result: The method generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supports high-resolution degradation inference, and aids in visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser provides a robust tool for analyzing atomic-resolution structural evolutions in STEM data by explicitly modeling degradation effects.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of vision-language models (VLMs) by prompting them to judge pattern visibility, revealing gaps between model and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how VLMs align with human perception of low-level visual features, particularly the CSF, a key aspect of human vision.

Method: A behavioral psychophysics-inspired approach using band-pass filtered noise images and diverse prompts to estimate CSF in VLMs.

Result: Some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, but none fully replicate both. Prompt phrasing significantly affects responses.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating VLMs' visual sensitivity and highlights discrepancies with human perception, emphasizing prompt stability concerns.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) to enhance spatial consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent or distorted images due to limited structural information. Leveraging intrinsic scene properties can address this issue.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic properties using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable, and integrates them into Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to simultaneously denoise image and intrinsic domains.

Result: The method corrects spatial inconsistencies, produces more natural scene layouts, and maintains image fidelity and textual alignment.

Conclusion: Co-generating images with intrinsic scene properties improves spatial consistency and realism without degrading image quality.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework for semantic segmentation that decouples image and label transformations to address implicit label noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain subtle label imperfections due to ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability, which can impair model performance. Existing augmentation methods risk amplifying these issues.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations to segmentation labels while preserving original images, encouraging robust representation learning despite label inconsistencies.

Result: NSegment+ achieves significant mIoU gains on datasets like Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, with improvements up to +3.39.

Conclusion: Addressing implicit label noise through decoupled augmentation (NSegment+) enhances semantic segmentation performance, with further gains possible when combined with other training techniques.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

TL;DR: PQ-DAF improves driver distraction detection by using a pose-driven quality-controlled data augmentation framework to enhance cross-domain robustness in few-shot learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for driver distraction detection struggle with generalization due to few-shot learning challenges and domain shifts between training and real-world data.

Method: Proposes PQ-DAF, combining a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) for pose feature synthesis and a CogVLM-based quality assessment module to filter low-quality samples.

Result: PQ-DAF significantly boosts performance in few-shot scenarios, improving model generalization under data scarcity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data annotation costs and domain shifts, enhancing real-world applicability of driver distraction detection.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to suppress unwanted content in text-to-image diffusion models by modifying text embeddings with a delta vector, improving control over generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with suppressing strongly entangled content (e.g., a mustache in "Charlie Chaplin") even when explicitly instructed to exclude it.

Method: Introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings, obtained via zero-shot, and a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method for cross-attention. Also optimizes delta vectors for personalized models.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics, enabling precise suppression of unwanted content.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses entanglement issues in text-to-image generation, offering improved control and suppression capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

*Chaesong Park,Eunbin Seo,Jihyeon Hwang,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane is a slope-aware, temporally consistent framework for 3D lane detection, improving robustness and accuracy through adaptive feature fusion and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of fixed slope anchors in previous methods and enhance robustness to diverse road geometries.

Method: Proposes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamic slope-specific feature fusion and a Height Consistency Module for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SC-Lane sets a rigorous standard for 3D lane detection, demonstrating significant improvements in height estimation and lane detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs rely on ControlNet, which adds significant parameter and computational costs. NanoControl aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: NanoControl uses a LoRA-style control module to learn signals directly from conditioning inputs and a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism for deep fusion of conditional features.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 0.024% parameter increase and 0.029% GFLOPs increase, reducing computational overhead while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: NanoControl offers a highly efficient and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

*Keishi Ishihara,Kento Sasaki,Tsubasa Takahashi,Daiki Shiono,Yu Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA is a large-scale VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of existing VLMs by providing dense annotations and novel QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs trained on static image-text pairs lack precise spatiotemporal reasoning for dynamic traffic scenes, limiting their effectiveness in autonomous driving.

Method: Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, STRIDE-QA includes 16M QA pairs over 285K frames with dense annotations (3D boxes, segmentation masks, tracks). It introduces three novel QA tasks for spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs on STRIDE-QA achieve 55% spatial localization success and 28% motion prediction consistency, outperforming general-purpose VLMs (near-zero scores).

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for developing reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRISP introduces Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting to address continual video instance segmentation challenges, improving stability and plasticity while maintaining temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation, ensuring plasticity for new categories and stability for learned ones.

Method: Uses instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompt learning, and contrastive learning for semantic coherence. Introduces a query-prompt matching mechanism and inter-task correlation strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on YouTube-VIS datasets, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enhancing segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively addresses continual video instance segmentation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DOD-SA, a framework for infrared-visible object detection using single-modality annotations, reducing annotation costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly dual-modality annotations. DOD-SA aims to leverage single-modality annotations for robust cross-modality detection.

Method: DOD-SA uses a teacher-student network (CoSD-TSNet) with single- and dual-modality branches, pseudo-labeling, and a progressive training strategy (PaST).

Result: Experiments on DroneVehicle show DOD-SA outperforms SOTA methods.

Conclusion: DOD-SA effectively reduces annotation costs and improves cross-modality detection performance.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

*Dhruv Dosi,Rohit Meena,Param Rajpura,Yogesh Kumar Meena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (DELP) and toolkit (SkeySpot) for automated symbol spotting in electrical floor plans, achieving high accuracy with YOLOv8 and supporting digitization for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy floor plans are hard to interpret at scale due to lack of machine-readability, necessitating automated solutions for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A labelled DELP dataset is created, and pretrained object detection models (like YOLOv8) are benchmarked. SkeySpot is developed for real-time symbol detection.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves 82.5% mAP on DELP. SkeySpot enables scalable, standardized outputs for interoperable workflows.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual effort, supports SMEs, and promotes standardization and sustainability in construction.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

TL;DR: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired model, aligns with human perception in image tasks like denoising and deblurring, suggesting unsupervised learning of perceptual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if human visual perception emerges from image statistics and if bio-inspired models can replicate perceptual judgments.

Method: End-to-end optimization of PerceptNet for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: Encoder (V1-like layer) correlates highly with human perception, optimal for moderate noise/blur/sparsity.

Conclusion: Visual system may be tuned to remove specific distortions; bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics unsupervised.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

### [37] [Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453)
*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Mamba, an online video super-resolution method using Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack long-range temporal modeling. The paper leverages state space models (SSMs) for linear complexity and global receptive fields to address this limitation.

Method: TS-Mamba uses trajectory-aware token selection and a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module with shifted SSMs blocks for efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. A trajectory-aware loss function supervises trajectory generation.

Result: TS-Mamba outperforms six benchmark models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 22.7% complexity reduction (in MACs).

Conclusion: The proposed TS-Mamba method effectively combines long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba for superior online VSR performance.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Motivation: Address the domain shift challenge in predicting multi-species plant images from single-species training data, leveraging taxonomic hierarchies for improved accuracy.

Method: Uses a pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-B/14 backbone with multi-head classification for species, genus, and family. Techniques include multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies (bagging, Hydra).

Result: Achieved strong performance, ranking 3rd on the private leaderboard, tested on 1.4M training images covering 7,806 species.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles domain shift and multi-label prediction, demonstrating the potential of vision transformers and taxonomic hierarchies in plant species identification.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.

*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining domain randomization and self-training with autoencoder-based quality control enables effective 3D skull-stripping using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for volumetric images like brain MRI is laborious. Domain randomization and self-training can reduce dependency on labeled data, but anatomical variability is limited with few labels.

Method: 1. Synthesize images from voxel intensity bins to train an initial model. 2. Use a convolutional autoencoder (AE) to assess pseudo-label quality. 3. Fine-tune the model with top-ranking pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves skull-stripping performance close to models trained with more labeled data. AE-based ranking correlates better with segmentation accuracy than consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: Combining domain randomization and AE-based quality control allows effective semi-supervised segmentation with very limited labeled data, reducing labeling burdens.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and enhances three radar data processing methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, Kalman Filtering) for Human Action Recognition (HAR) using mmWave radar, addressing privacy concerns and data quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with vision-based HAR systems and the need for robust, privacy-preserving alternatives using mmWave radar sensors.

Method: Performance analysis of DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually, in pairs, and combined, with proposed enhancements for accuracy.

Result: Detailed insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their combinations, including recognition accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The study guides future mmWave-based HAR systems by evaluating and improving radar data processing methods.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STAMP, a deep learning framework for diagnosing STAS in LUAD, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS in LUAD is linked to poor outcomes, but manual diagnosis is error-prone. Automated deep learning solutions are needed.

Method: STAMP uses a dual-branch architecture with transformer-based encoding and attention to focus on STAS-related features.

Result: STAMP achieved AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928 on three datasets, outperforming clinical diagnosis.

Conclusion: STAMP is an effective tool for STAS diagnosis, improving accuracy and reducing manual errors.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a tuning- and inversion-free framework for efficient and consistent image editing, outperforming existing methods in semantic preservation and target alignment while requiring fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-align with target prompts and inadequately preserve source image semantics, relying on inefficient inversion anchors.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising path, uses gradient-driven regularization, and injects target prompt semantics via a consistency model.

Result: TweezeEdit achieves superior semantic preservation and target alignment, requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit offers a more efficient and effective solution for real-time image editing, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting integrates MSAA and dual geometric constraints to improve detail preservation in high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insufficient geometric constraints in 3D Gaussian splatting lead to blurred reconstructions of fine details, especially in high-frequency regions.

Method: The framework combines multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples and dual geometric constraints: adaptive weighting and gradient differential constraints.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in preserving high-frequency details and sharp discontinuities, with significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances detail preservation in 3D Gaussian splatting while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

TL;DR: A segmentation-driven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) is proposed to augment datasets for bolt defect detection by generating high-quality defect images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions hinder bolt defect detection performance.

Method: SBDE uses Bolt-SAM for segmentation, MOD-LaMa for defect editing, and ERA for dataset expansion.

Result: SBDE-generated images outperform state-of-the-art models and improve detection performance.

Conclusion: SBDE is effective and has potential for practical applications in bolt defect detection.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes well to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines egocentric video and music for dance motion prediction, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

*Ayushman Sarkar,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Zhenyu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey categorizes visual reasoning into five types, reviews methodologies and evaluation protocols, and identifies open challenges and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys lack a unified analysis of visual reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols, creating a gap this survey aims to fill.

Method: The survey categorizes visual reasoning into relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense types, examining architectures like graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems.

Result: The review highlights limitations in evaluation protocols and identifies challenges like scalability, integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, and lack of benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Bridging perception and reasoning is crucial for transparent, trustworthy AI systems, especially in critical domains like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

*Ziye Deng,Ruihan He,Jiaxiang Liu,Yuan Wang,Zijie Meng,Songtao Jiang,Yong Xie,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale medical image grounding dataset, and Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework, to address limitations in existing research. The framework outperforms baselines and enhances downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image grounding research lacks modality coverage, fine-grained annotations, and a unified framework, limiting its applicability.

Method: The authors construct Med-GLIP-5M, a dataset with 5.3M region-level annotations across seven modalities, and propose Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on this dataset.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in grounding benchmarks and improves performance in downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework advance medical image grounding by enabling hierarchical semantic understanding and improving downstream applications.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GCRPNet, a graph-enhanced network for SOD in ORSIs, combining Mamba architecture with novel modules for improved feature integration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SOD for ORSIs include scale variations and low contrast. Existing ViT and CNN methods struggle with integrating global and local features effectively.

Method: Uses VSS encoder for multi-scale features, DS-HGAM for cross-layer interaction, and LEVSS block with adaptive scanning for local modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments.

Conclusion: GCRPNet effectively addresses SOD challenges in ORSIs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen is a novel model for multiple retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets, addressing domain shifts and label absence via dual-stream feature learning and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on fully annotated datasets and overcome challenges like domain shifts and missing labels in partially labeled datasets for retinal disease screening.

Method: Uses two streams: one for deterministic features and another for probabilistic features with uncertainty injection. Aligns features via distillation and employs pseudo label consistency and self-distillation.

Result: Significantly improves detection performance for six retinal diseases and normal cases, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively addresses domain shifts and label absence, enhancing retinal disease screening performance.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

*Marc J. Fischer,Jeffrey Potts,Gabriel Urreola,Dax Jones,Paolo Palmisciano,E. Bradley Strong,Branden Cord,Andrew D. Hernandez,Julia D. Sharma,E. Brandon Strong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel AR surgical navigation system improves accuracy in simulated catheter placements using HoloLens 2, outperforming static visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AR depth perception and occlusion challenges in surgical navigation, enhancing precision in procedures like ventricular drain catheter placement.

Method: The system uses surface tracing for target registration and real-time infrared tool tracking with HoloLens 2. Two AR guidance methods (static visualization and real-time tracking) were tested on a phantom model.

Result: Real-time tool-tracking guidance improved accuracy metrics (insertion, target deviation, angular error, depth precision) and was preferred by users.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of AR with real-time tracking for precise surgical navigation, offering a viable solution to current AR limitations in surgery.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP), a novel OOD detection method that enhances semantic supervision by retrieving external knowledge to augment prompts in a pre-trained vision-language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods rely on limited or mismatched outlier samples, leading to suboptimal performance. RAP addresses this by leveraging external knowledge for better semantic supervision.

Method: RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers using joint similarity with external textual knowledge, augmenting prompts during training. During testing, it dynamically updates prompts based on encountered OOD samples.

Result: RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing FPR95 by 7.05% and improving AUROC by 1.71% on ImageNet-1k in 1-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: RAP's dynamic prompt augmentation with external knowledge significantly improves OOD detection, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

### [52] [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557)
*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQAT is a hybrid quantization method combining PTQ and QAT, selectively fine-tuning critical layers for efficiency and accuracy, outperforming QAT-only baselines in 3D perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between PTQ's performance degradation and QAT's high resource demands by proposing a hybrid approach.

Method: Select critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and apply PTQ to others, focusing on layers with smaller output discrepancies for better error compensation.

Result: Achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction with fewer weights fine-tuned.

Conclusion: PTQAT is efficient, universal, and outperforms QAT-only methods, making it suitable for diverse 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker improves talking head video generation by combining implicit and explicit motion cues, addressing issues like motion blur and lip jitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack explicit articulatory priors, leading to poor video quality.

Method: HM-Talker uses a hybrid motion representation with Cross-Modal Disentanglement and Hybrid Motion Modeling Modules.

Result: Produces high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos with better lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: HM-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and synchronization.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

TL;DR: SpaRC-AD is a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for autonomous driving, addressing limitations of vision-only systems in adverse conditions. It improves performance across tasks like 3D detection, tracking, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based autonomous driving systems struggle in adverse weather, occlusions, and velocity estimation. Accurate motion understanding and long-horizon prediction are critical for safety.

Method: SpaRC-AD uses sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation for robust 3D scene representations. It refines agent anchors, map polylines, and motion modeling.

Result: The method outperforms vision-only baselines: +4.8% mAP in 3D detection, +8.3% AMOTA in tracking, and better planning metrics (-0.1m L2, -9% TPC).

Conclusion: Radar-camera fusion enhances safety-critical scenarios, achieving spatial coherence and temporal consistency. The framework is validated on benchmarks like nuScenes and Bench2Drive.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts SAM for RSCD, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in change detection tasks.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.

*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Modal Agent, a flexible and adaptive system for Referring-based Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), leveraging LLMs and specialized tools to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RVOS methods are computationally complex and inflexible, while vision-language foundation models offer training-free potential but lack adaptability.

Method: The proposed Multi-Modal Agent uses LLMs to generate dynamic workflows and interacts with specialized tools for low-level tasks across modalities.

Result: The system outperforms prior methods on RVOS and Ref-AVS tasks.

Conclusion: The agentic approach provides a more flexible and adaptive solution for multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' human-centered interaction capabilities, revealing gaps in advanced tasks and highlighting the benefits of multimodal inputs and reasoning-enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in MLLMs is limited by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, necessitating a benchmark like HumanSense.

Method: HumanSense evaluates MLLMs using multimodal contexts and rational feedback. It employs modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning.

Result: Leading MLLMs show room for improvement, especially in advanced tasks. Omni-modal models and reasoning-enhanced approaches yield better performance.

Conclusion: HumanSense underscores the importance of contextual analysis and reasoning for empathetic MLLM interactions, offering a path for future improvements.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

*Yixing Liu,Minggui Teng,Yifei Xia,Peiqi Duan,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvTurb is a novel framework using event streams to decouple and remove atmospheric turbulence distortions in images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric turbulence causes blur and tilt distortions in images, complicating computer vision tasks. Current methods struggle with the problem's ill-posed nature.

Method: EvTurb uses a two-step event-guided network: event integrals reduce blur, and a variance map from event streams removes tilt distortion.

Result: EvTurb outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is computationally efficient.

Conclusion: EvTurb effectively addresses turbulence distortions and introduces TurbEvent, a real-captured dataset for diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: P$^3$A is a new adversarial patch attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of prior methods by introducing a practical metric (PASR), a tailored loss (LCSL), and a preprocessing step (PSPP) for high-resolution datasets.


<details>

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA) is a lightweight upsampling module for super-resolution, improving high-frequency detail reconstruction and reducing aliasing artifacts with minimal added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsamplers often fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: FGA integrates a Fourier feature-based MLP, cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer, and frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity.

Result: FGA enhances performance across five super-resolution backbones, achieving PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and 29% better frequency-domain consistency.

Conclusion: FGA is a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods, effectively reducing aliasing and preserving fine details.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: FIND-Net is a novel deep learning framework for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) in CT imaging, combining frequency and spatial domain processing to improve artifact suppression and structural preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in CT imaging degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing deep learning methods struggle to balance artifact suppression with structural detail preservation.

Method: FIND-Net integrates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task in both spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Experiments show FIND-Net outperforms state-of-the-art MAR methods with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement. It also performs well on real-world clinical CT scans.

Conclusion: FIND-Net advances MAR performance by offering superior structural preservation and clinical applicability, with potential for broader use in medical imaging.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

*Nicola Dall'Asen,Xiaofeng Zhang,Reyhane Askari Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Jakob Verbeek,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance improves synthetic data diversity and quality using real exemplar images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal real data and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generation quality and diversity in conditional image generative models, and mitigate distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Introduces Chamfer Guidance, a training-free approach leveraging real exemplar images to guide synthetic data generation, focusing on quality and diversity.

Result: Achieves high precision (97.5%) and distributional coverage (92.7%) with 32 real images, and boosts downstream classifier accuracy by up to 16%.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance effectively enhances synthetic data utility, outperforming baselines in diversity, quality, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV is an interactive vision-language model (VLM) that integrates satellite imagery and sensor data for environmental monitoring, outperforming existing models in temporal and scenario-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on biased captions, and miss interactive reasoning. ChatENV addresses these gaps.

Method: The framework involves creating a large dataset with temporal image pairs and sensor metadata, annotating with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0, and fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-VL using LoRA adapters.

Result: ChatENV excels in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (BERT-F1 0.903) and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art temporal models.

Conclusion: ChatENV is a robust tool for sensor-aware environmental monitoring, offering interactive scenario-based analysis.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how subtle, often imperceptible image acquisition parameters affect visual encoders, revealing their systematic encoding and impact on semantic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore overlooked subtle image transformations and their influence on visual encoders, beyond severe corruptions.

Method: Analyzes parameters of image acquisition and transformations, assessing their encoding in visual representations and impact on predictions.

Result: Subtle parameters are systematically encoded and can significantly affect semantic predictions, depending on their correlation with labels.

Conclusion: Subtle image transformations, though imperceptible, can profoundly influence visual encoders, highlighting the need to account for them in model training and evaluation.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

*Helena Russello,Rik van der Tol,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A markerless lameness detection method using pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating manual feature engineering and leveraging temporal motion features from keypoint trajectories.

Method: Combines T-LEAP pose estimation to extract keypoint trajectories and a BLSTM classifier for binary lameness classification.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based methods (80%), and works with short (1-second) video sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for lameness detection, requiring minimal data and no manual feature extraction.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

### [66] [SemPT: Semantic Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10645)
*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) improves visual transfer learning by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge, outperforming existing methods on 15 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing category-specific representations and transferable knowledge in visual transfer learning for unseen categories.

Method: Introduces SemPT, a two-step prompting strategy using LLMs to extract shared visual attributes and generate attribute-level descriptions, followed by visually guided weighting and joint alignment of image and text embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: SemPT effectively enhances transferability and generalization in visual learning tasks by leveraging attribute-level knowledge and dynamic inference.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

*Zhangyong Tang,Tianyang Xu,Xuefeng Zhu,Chunyang Cheng,Tao Zhou,Xiaojun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark for multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), and proposes a serial unification process inspired by continual learning to address performance degradation caused by inconsistency in training and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMVOT practices mix all data sensor types in parallel, leading to inconsistency and performance degradation due to the lack of a unified benchmark.

Method: The work advances in two ways: (1) introducing UniBench300 to unify multiple task data, reducing inference time, and (2) reformulating unification in a serial format, aligning with continual learning principles.

Result: UniBench300 cuts time consumption by 27% and shows the superiority of continual learning in stable unification. Performance degradation is linked to network capacity and modality discrepancies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of UniBench300 and continual learning in MMVOT, offering insights for future multi-modal vision research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AddressVLM improves fine-grained street-level localization in LVLMs by integrating satellite images and cross-view alignment, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs perform poorly in fine-grained street-level localization due to limited visual cues in street-view VQA data.

Method: Incorporates perspective-invariant satellite images, cross-view alignment tuning, and automatic label generation to enhance LVLMs.

Result: AddressVLM outperforms other LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in address localization accuracy on two datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of macro cues and cross-view alignment significantly improves fine-grained localization in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining cleaned real data and synthetic identities (via Stable Diffusion and Vec2Face) achieves top performance in the DataCV ICCV Challenge for face recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a high-quality face dataset without overlapping identities with existing public datasets, ensuring diversity and avoiding identity leakage.

Method: Clean HSFace dataset using MoE (clustering + GPT-4o verification), augment real data, generate synthetic identities with Stable Diffusion and Vec2Face, and use curriculum learning.

Result: Achieved 1st place in the competition; dataset improves model performance across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach efficiently constructs a diverse, high-quality dataset, validated by competition success and performance gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

TL;DR: HyperTea integrates CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD), enhancing multi-timescale feature representation and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIRSTD methods lack high-order correlation modeling and multi-timescale feature enhancement, limiting detection performance.

Method: HyperTea combines global (GTEM) and local (LTEM) temporal enhancement modules with a temporal alignment module (TAM) to model high-order spatiotemporal correlations.

Result: HyperTea outperforms existing methods on DAUB and IRDST datasets, demonstrating superior detection performance.

Conclusion: HyperTea is the first to integrate CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for MIRSTD, offering a robust solution for complex motion patterns and weak target intensities.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: A method for T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI at 0.55T combines implicit neural representations with physics-informed regularization to address motion challenges and reduce scan time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI at mid-field (0.55T) is challenging due to motion-corrupted data and long scan times.

Method: Joint reconstruction of data across echo times (TEs) using implicit neural representations and physics-informed regularization to model T2 decay.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on simulated and in vivo datasets, including the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping at 0.55T.

Conclusion: The method reduces scan time by leveraging anatomical redundancy, showing promise for clinical applications.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IADGPT, a framework for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD), addressing limitations of existing LVLMs by mimicking human-like reasoning and localization. It uses a three-stage training strategy and a new dataset, showing strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack industrial knowledge and reasoning for FS-IAD, falling short of human inspectors. The goal is to bridge this gap with a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes IADGPT with a three-stage training strategy: acquiring industrial knowledge, discrepancy awareness, and in-context learning for generalization. Uses logits and attention maps for anomaly scoring.

Result: IADGPT achieves significant performance gains in anomaly detection and shows competitiveness in localization and reasoning.

Conclusion: IADGPT effectively addresses FS-IAD challenges, demonstrating human-like capabilities and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis are costly and produce blurry results, prompting the need for an efficient and high-fidelity solution.

Method: Uses a camera pose-conditioned U-Net (TUNet) to predict target view latents and a novel fusion strategy to preserve details, leveraging DDIM inversion and sampling.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MVImgNet, achieving better texture and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently synthesizes high-quality novel views from a single image by leveraging pretrained diffusion models and innovative fusion techniques.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCFNet, a motion cue fusion network combining RGB and event cameras for improved object detection in challenging lighting. It includes modules for temporal alignment, spatial resolution enhancement, and adaptive feature fusion, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle with dynamic range limitations in complex traffic environments, leading to poor contrast and loss of details, which hampers object detection.

Method: MCFNet integrates an event camera with an RGB camera, using modules for temporal alignment (ECM), spatial resolution enhancement (EDUM), and adaptive feature fusion (CMM).

Result: MCFNet outperforms existing methods, improving mAP50 by 7.4% and mAP by 1.7% on the DSEC-Det dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of event cameras and adaptive fusion techniques significantly enhances object detection in poor lighting and fast-moving scenarios.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The

### [75] [CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710)
*Joohyeon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountCluster, a method to improve object count accuracy in diffusion-based text-to-image models by clustering cross-attention maps early in the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to accurately reflect the number of objects specified in prompts, often due to limitations in early-stage denoising.

Method: CountCluster partitions cross-attention maps into clusters based on input object count, optimizes latent alignment with a target distribution, and avoids external tools or training.

Result: Achieves an 18.5% improvement in object count accuracy over existing methods.

Conclusion: CountCluster effectively enhances quantity control in text-to-image generation without additional training or tools.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of heavy diffusion models and quantization loss in existing autoregressive models for text-to-image generation.

Method: Uses discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with next-token prediction, paired with a flow matching head.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation and excels in image editing.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 demonstrates the power of a unified autoregressive approach, with plans to release code and models for open research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-real-time maritime vessel monitoring with SAR data is limited by bandwidth and latency due to ground processing. On-board processing could alleviate these constraints but faces resource limitations.

Method: Designs and evaluates neural networks for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1 in Stripmap and IW modes, testing deployment on FPGA.

Result: Shows feasibility of on-board processing with one model on FPGA and successful binary classification between ships and windmills.

Conclusion: Neural networks enable efficient on-board SAR data processing, reducing downlink needs and supporting real-time maritime surveillance.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [78] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for cross-view localization by improving cross-view image matching, introducing a Surface Model and SimRefiner module, and releasing a benchmark dataset (CVFM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view localization lack strict correspondences, leading to coarse or inconsistent matches, which limits interpretability.

Method: The framework includes a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module for refining similarity matrices without post-processing.

Result: The approach significantly enhances localization accuracy and matching quality, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances cross-view localization by addressing matching challenges and introducing a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE, a method to better utilize token similarity in codebooks for autoregressive image generation, outperforming k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive models ignore rich token similarity information in codebooks, and k-means clustering fails to exploit it effectively due to token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy.

Method: Proposes DCPE, which uses instance-based distance and agglomerative merging to address k-means limitations, improving token similarity extraction.

Result: DCPE accelerates training by 42% on LlamaGen-B and enhances FID and IS performance.

Conclusion: DCPE is a plug-and-play solution that effectively leverages codebook prior for better autoregressive model training and performance.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark for evaluating cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA, highlighting limitations of current models in diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating MLLMs' performance in real-world, high-impact domains beyond common daily activities.

Method: EgoCross includes 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips from four diverse domains, supporting OpenQA and CloseQA formats.

Result: Most MLLMs struggle with cross-domain generalization, showing limitations in non-daily-life scenarios.

Conclusion: EgoCross serves as a foundation for advancing robust, domain-adaptive egocentric video understanding, with pilot studies suggesting potential improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

TL;DR: ConGCD introduces a human-inspired method for generalized category discovery by decomposing objects into visual primitives and using consensus units for discriminative patterns and invariants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human perceptual systems and machine learning in recognizing objects across known and novel categories.

Method: Decomposes objects into visual primitives, uses dominant and contextual consensus units, and dynamically optimizes activation pathways.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks.

Conclusion: ConGCD is a consensus-aware paradigm for generalized category discovery.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of synthetic data in training privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models compared to real-world data.

Method: Two competition tracks: one using only synthetic data, and another mixing synthetic with limited real-world data. Nine teams submitted diverse models, tested on three datasets.

Result: Models trained solely on synthetic data achieved competitive performance (F1 scores >0.8). Methodological choices in the mixed track often outweighed the benefits of real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data holds promise for privacy-aware biometric development, with competitive performance and reduced reliance on real-world data.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

*Wongyun Yu,Ahyun Seo,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for detecting reflection and rotation symmetry in complex scenes using geometric primitives and a dual-branch architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes is challenging, especially in localizing individual symmetry axes with precision.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture equivariant to the dihedral group, with orientational anchors for reflection symmetry and rotational matching for rotational symmetry.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of precise symmetry axis detection in complex scenes.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy and Dual Perception Network (DPNet) to improve deepfake detection by adapting to unknown forgery techniques and capturing forgery traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods struggle with unknown forgery techniques and lack generalization, necessitating a more adaptable approach.

Method: The FGL strategy captures differential information between known and unknown techniques, while DPNet dynamically perceives forgery traces in frequency and spatial domains, using graph convolution for feature correlation.

Result: Experiments show the approach generalizes well across scenarios and handles unknown forgery effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust support for deepfake detection, addressing the limitations of current techniques.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC is a model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction, offering flexibility, efficiency, and high anatomical fidelity without requiring large training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven registration methods rely on large datasets and lack generalizability, while model-driven methods face scalability issues. DARC addresses these limitations.

Method: DARC uses a coordinate descent strategy and centrality-enforcing activation function to handle arbitrary numbers of 3D images efficiently, supporting various dissimilarity metrics.

Result: DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases and excels in one-shot segmentation and shape synthesis applications.

Conclusion: DARC provides a resource-efficient, generalizable solution for atlas construction and related tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Motivation: To assess and enhance VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, a critical but underexplored capability for robust world models.

Method: Diagnostic analysis of VLMs, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Result: Improved spatio-physical reasoning in Qwen2.5-VL-7B, outperforming proprietary models, though generalization remains limited.

Conclusion: Despite improvements, new approaches are needed for better generalization in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Result: Experiments show limited detection capabilities on AEGIS's challenging subsets, highlighting its complexity beyond current model generalization.

Conclusion: AEGIS advances research by providing a robust benchmark for developing reliable video authenticity detection methods against real-world forgery threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [88] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE is a data-free joint training framework combining adaptive block-sparse attention and sparsity-aware step distillation to accelerate diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant speedups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers face slow iterative denoising and high computational costs for long sequences, requiring efficient acceleration strategies without compromising quality.

Method: BLADE introduces (1) Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) for dynamic sparsity masks and (2) sparsity-aware step distillation via Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM).

Result: BLADE achieves 14.10x and 8.89x speedups on Wan2.1-1.3B and CogVideoX-5B, respectively, with improved VBench-2.0 scores (e.g., 0.569 from 0.534 for CogVideoX-5B).

Conclusion: BLADE effectively combines sparse attention and step distillation, offering scalable acceleration and quality enhancement for diffusion transformers in video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

*Zhenning Shi,Zizheng Yan,Yuhang Yu,Clara Xue,Jingyu Zhuang,Qi Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Tao Li,Qingnan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFlowSR is a novel framework for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) that improves alignment between LR and reference HR images, using a new dataset (Landmark-4K) for UHD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RefSR methods struggle with alignment and lack high-quality datasets for fine-grained details.

Method: TriFlowSR introduces a Reference Matching Strategy for better pattern matching and uses the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD scenarios.

Result: The approach outperforms previous methods in utilizing reference HR image details.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR is the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for UHD landmark scenarios under real-world degradation.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

### [90] [Cooperative Face Liveness Detection from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10786)
*Artem Sokolov,Mikhail Nikitin,Anton Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cooperative video-based face liveness detection method uses controlled face movement and optical flow analysis to distinguish real faces from attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve liveness detection by leveraging user interaction and spatial-temporal features for better discrimination against presentation attacks.

Method: Users move their face closer to the camera while optical flow analysis extracts facial volume. A neural classifier processes optical flows and RGB frames.

Result: Significantly improved discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks.

Conclusion: The method enhances liveness detection reliability by combining controlled movement and neural optical flow estimation.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

### [91] [VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794)
*De-Xing Huang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Rui-Ze Ma,Nu-Fang Xiao,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VasoMIM, a novel self-supervised learning framework, improves vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms by integrating vascular anatomy knowledge into masked image modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data and the failure of conventional MIM to capture vascular anatomy due to class imbalance drive the need for a tailored solution.

Method: VasoMIM uses an anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss to focus on vessel-relevant regions and improve vascular representation.

Result: VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for enhancing X-ray angiogram analysis by addressing the limitations of conventional MIM.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OF-Diff improves remote sensing image generation by using prior object shapes and a dual-branch diffusion model, enhancing fidelity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with low-fidelity images in remote sensing, impacting object detection reliability.

Method: Proposes OF-Diff with prior shape extraction, dual-branch diffusion, and DDPO for fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with mAP improvements of 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles.

Conclusion: OF-Diff significantly enhances object fidelity and diversity in remote sensing image generation.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on
resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1
delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This
architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational

Motivation: To advance UI interaction by creating a high-performing, open-source agent that requires minimal training data and excels in complex tasks.

Method: Uses reinforcement finetuning (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL, with reward functions, data cleaning, and self-evolving trajectory alignment for navigation.

Result: Achieves 94.1%/50.8% (7B) and 95.3%/61.9% (72B) on grounding benchmarks and 49.1%/65.9% on AndroidWorld, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: UI-Venus sets a new benchmark for UI agents, offering open-source tools and methods to advance research in UI interaction.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaCon-Stereo introduces a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo matching, addressing occlusion issues with a teacher-student paradigm and multi-baseline inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric consistency fails in occluded regions, leading to ill-posed correspondences. BaCon-Stereo aims to improve stereo matching in both occluded and non-occluded areas.

Method: Uses a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, leveraging teacher predictions for occluded regions and an occlusion-aware attention map.

Result: Improves prediction in occluded and non-occluded regions, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo is effective, generalizable, and robust, with code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: AdaptFED enhances TransFed by refining focal modulation in federated learning (FL) with task-aware embeddings, better theoretical bounds, and broader validation, while reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalizability and scalability of transformer-based FL, especially in non-IID and cross-domain settings.

Method: Incorporates task-aware client embeddings, low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, and validates across time-series and multilingual data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in source-free and cross-task FL setups.

Conclusion: Extends focal modulation capabilities, enabling more adaptive and scalable transformer-based FL systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

*Harold Haodong Chen,Haojian Huang,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHPO is a framework for hierarchical cross-modal preference optimization to improve physical plausibility in video generation by aligning preferences at instance, state, motion, and semantic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating physically plausible videos is challenging but crucial for realism. Existing methods lack fine-grained alignment and rely on costly dataset construction.

Method: PhysHPO aligns preferences hierarchically (instance, state, motion, semantic levels) and uses an automated pipeline to select high-quality data from existing datasets.

Result: PhysHPO enhances physical plausibility and video quality, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work pioneers fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for realistic video generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: GPT-5 models were tested for brain tumor classification via VQA on MRI data, with GPT-5-mini performing best (44.19% accuracy), but none reached clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor classification on MRI is crucial for treatment planning, and LLMs offer potential for integrating image and language reasoning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a BraTS-derived VQA benchmark with zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: GPT-5-mini led with 44.19% accuracy, but performance varied by tumor type, and none met clinical standards.

Conclusion: GPT-5 models show promise for neuro-oncological VQA but require improvement for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single stage, reducing manual effort and improving flexibility in cartoon production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cartoon production is labor-intensive, and existing AI methods handle stages separately, causing errors and artifacts.

Method: ToonComposer uses sparse sketch injection and a cartoon adaptation method with a spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a video foundation model for cartoons.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and efficiency, as validated by PKBench.

Conclusion: ToonComposer offers a superior, flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production, reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a decoder-only Transformer approach for 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods by using causal attention and large-scale pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods are either computationally expensive or scale poorly with sequence length. STream3R aims to address these limitations.

Method: STream3R uses a streaming framework with causal attention, inspired by language modeling, and learns geometric priors from large 3D datasets.

Result: The method outperforms prior work in static and dynamic scenes and is compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure.

Conclusion: STream3R demonstrates the potential of causal Transformer models for real-time 3D perception in streaming environments.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

*Antoine Labatie,Michael Vaccaro,Nina Lardiere,Anatol Garioud,Nicolas Gonthier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of Masked Autoencoder for Earth observation data, optimizes fusion strategies and introduces spectral normalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multitemporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-supervised methods need adaptation for Earth observation data's unique characteristics.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and normalization schemes, leading to MAESTRO's design with optimized fusion and spectral normalization.

Result: MAESTRO sets new state-of-the-art on multitemporal tasks and remains competitive on mono-temporal tasks.

Conclusion: MAESTRO effectively adapts self-supervised learning for Earth observation data, with reproducible code provided.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [104] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL proposes a memory-efficient VCIL method by integrating episodic and semantic memory, achieving strong performance with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance in VCIL by avoiding the limitations of existing methods (memory-inefficient dense samples or performance-sacrificing sparse samples).

Method: Introduces ESSENTIAL, combining episodic memory (sparse features) and semantic memory (learnable prompts), with a novel memory retrieval module using cross-attention to reconstruct dense features.

Result: Validated on multiple datasets (UCF-101, HMDB51, etc.), ESSENTIAL achieves strong performance while using significantly less memory.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively balances memory-efficiency and performance in VCIL, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

*Mengyuan Liu,Xinshun Wang,Zhongbin Fang,Deheng Ye,Xia Li,Tao Tang,Songtao Wu,Xiangtai Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified cross-domain model, HiC, for 3D human motion, improving generalization, scalability, and performance over its predecessor PiC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, limiting practicality and scalability.

Method: HiC extends PiC by combining pose and mesh representations, expanding task coverage, using max-min similarity prompt sampling, and dual-branch context injection.

Result: HiC outperforms PiC in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: HiC demonstrates potential for a flexible, scalable unified cross-domain 3D human motion model.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework for automatic rigging and animation of 3D objects, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in skeletal prediction and skinning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformation of static 3D models into animated assets is a bottleneck in content creation, requiring expert intervention despite advances in generative AI.

Method: Puppeteer uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal prediction, an attention-based architecture for skinning weights, and a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline.

Result: The system outperforms existing methods in accuracy and quality, handling diverse 3D content and producing stable animations without jittering.

Conclusion: Puppeteer provides a robust solution for automating rigging and animation, significantly improving efficiency and quality in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QVF introduces a quantum-based method for 2D/3D visual field learning, outperforming classical and existing quantum approaches in accuracy and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in QINRs like architecture design, training efficiency, and quantum-classical interplay by proposing a novel Quantum Visual Field (QVF) approach.

Method: Uses neural amplitude encoding and fully entangled parametrized quantum circuits in real Hilbert space for stable training and fast convergence.

Result: QVF surpasses existing quantum and classical methods in visual representation accuracy and detail learning, validated on quantum hardware simulators.

Conclusion: QVF demonstrates practical potential in 2D/3D field completion and shape interpolation, advancing quantum implicit neural representations.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.
