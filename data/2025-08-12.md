### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND and Med-GRIM improve medical VQA by refining embeddings and using graph-based retrieval, achieving efficiency and accuracy with modular workflows and small language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multimodal models lack precision for domain-specific tasks like medical VQA, prompting the need for refined embeddings and efficient workflows.

Method: BIND refines joint embeddings with dense encodings; Med-GRIM uses graph-based retrieval, prompt engineering, and small language models for efficiency.

Result: Med-GRIM achieves high performance with low compute, and the DermaGraph dataset supports zero-shot multimodal medical research.

Conclusion: The approach enhances medical VQA precision and efficiency, with potential for scalable applications in specialized domains.

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker is a unified DiT-based framework for portrait animation, addressing dynamic styles like head movements and lip synchronization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on lip sync or static emotions, ignoring dynamic styles (e.g., head movements) and incurring computational overhead with dual U-Net architectures.

Method: DiTalker uses a Style-Emotion Encoding Module (separate branches for style and emotion) and an Audio-Style Fusion Module (parallel cross-attention layers) to decouple audio and styles. It also employs optimization constraints for lip sync and detail preservation.

Result: DiTalker excels in lip synchronization and speaking style controllability, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DiTalker offers a superior, unified approach for dynamic and style-controllable portrait animation.

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BigTokDetect, a framework for detecting pro-bigorexia content on TikTok, using a multimodal approach to overcome limitations of text-based detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media struggles to detect harmful pro-bigorexia content, which evades traditional text-based systems by mimicking fitness content.

Method: Developed BigTokDetect, a clinically-informed framework, and created BigTok, a multimodal dataset of 2,200 TikTok videos annotated by experts.

Result: Achieved 0.829% accuracy for primary category classification and 0.690% for subcategory detection, with multimodal fusion improving performance by 5-10%.

Conclusion: The work sets new benchmarks for multimodal harmful content detection and provides tools for scalable moderation in mental health domains.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM introduces a frequency-based augmentation framework for polyp segmentation, improving cross-domain robustness and achieving state-of-the-art results with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated data and domain shift in polyp segmentation, FPGM leverages consistent frequency signatures of polyp edges for better generalization.

Method: FPGM learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from labeled polyp edges and aligns unlabeled images' amplitude spectra with this prior while preserving phase information.

Result: FPGM outperforms ten competing methods, achieving over 10% gain in Dice score in data-scarce scenarios and demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: FPGM offers a clinically viable solution for polyp segmentation under limited supervision by enhancing cross-domain robustness.

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how vision reflection in LMMs improves accuracy, relies on textual concepts, and suggests training-free connectors enhance performance, offering insights into explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the explainability and performance of vision reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs).

Method: Analyzing vision reflection behavior, prompting LMMs to verify predictions, and testing training-free connectors.

Result: Improved recognition accuracy, reliance on textual concepts, and enhanced fine-grained recognition without extensive training.

Conclusion: Vision reflection is a promising strategy for robust and interpretable visual recognition in LMMs.

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer improves video-based behavior recognition by leveraging local spatiotemporal features and global dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D CNNs lack long-range dependency modeling, while Transformers are computationally expensive. A hybrid approach addresses both limitations.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework: 3D CNN for low-level spatiotemporal features and Transformer for long-range dependencies, fused for integration.

Result: Outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers in accuracy with manageable complexity, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework is effective and scalable for video-based behavior recognition.

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

### [7] [RMT-PPAD: Real-time Multi-task Learning for Panoptic Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06529)
*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Katsuya Suto,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD is a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model for autonomous driving, excelling in object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precision and real-time performance in panoptic driving perception by integrating multiple tasks into a single efficient model.

Method: Proposes a lightweight gate control with an adapter for feature fusion, an adaptive segmentation decoder for multi-scale feature learning, and resolves label inconsistency in lane line segmentation.

Result: Achieves mAP50 of 84.9%, Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% for lane line segmentation at 32.6 FPS.

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD delivers stable, state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios, with released source code and models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [8] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOPE, a new benchmark for evaluating object hallucination in LVLMs, outperforming the existing POPE benchmark by generating more misleading distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks like POPE are ineffective for assessing object hallucination in advanced LVLMs due to simplistic sampling strategies.

Method: HOPE uses CLIP to select high-likelihood negative objects and pairs true objects with false descriptions to create misleading distractors.

Result: HOPE causes a precision drop of 9-23% in LVLMs, significantly outperforming POPE.

Conclusion: HOPE provides a more rigorous assessment of LVLMs' hallucination vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

### [9] [Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Models on Feature Deficient Astrophotography Imagery Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06537)
*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking object detection models on MobilTelesco, a sparse night-sky dataset, reveals challenges in feature-deficient conditions compared to traditional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and PASCAL VOC lack signal sparsity, limiting their applicability to non-commercial domains like astrophotography.

Method: Several object detection models are benchmarked on the MobilTelesco dataset, which provides sparse night-sky images.

Result: The study highlights the challenges faced by detection models under feature-deficient conditions.

Conclusion: MobilTelesco fills a gap in datasets for sparse domains, revealing limitations of current models in such scenarios.

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

### [10] [MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543)
*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MILD, a diffusion model for multi-IP human erasing, addressing dataset limitations and spatial decoupling challenges with a new dataset and Human Morphology Guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex multi-IP scenarios due to dataset limitations and lack of spatial decoupling.

Method: Proposes Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD) with semantically separated pathways and Human Morphology Guidance for better spatial decoupling.

Result: MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on human erasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles complex human erasing tasks with improved performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

### [11] [Statistical Confidence Rescoring for Robust 3D Scene Graph Generation from Multi-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06546)
*Qi Xun Yeo,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for 3D semantic scene graph estimation using only multi-view RGB images, improving robustness by filtering noise and leveraging neighboring relations and statistical priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D semantic scene graph estimation without ground truth 3D annotations, using only multi-view RGB images.

Method: Uses semantic masks for feature aggregation, incorporates neighboring node information, and leverages statistical priors to refine predictions.

Result: Outperforms current methods relying solely on multi-view images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively estimates 3D scene graphs without 3D ground truth, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our
project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

### [12] [Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551)
*Ye Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator is a utility control mechanism enabling AI models to dynamically adjust performance for diverse applications, reducing the need for multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training and maintaining multiple DNN versions for varied performance needs is inefficient and resource-intensive.

Method: Proposes NNObfuscator, a mechanism for real-time performance adaptation in a single model, tested on tasks like image classification and text-to-image generation.

Result: Experiments show NNObfuscator successfully adapts models for diverse tasks without extensive modifications.

Conclusion: NNObfuscator improves resource allocation, reduces computation, and supports sustainable AI deployment.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Method: Constructed an age-diverse dataset using Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, supplemented with synthetic data. Evaluated using XceptionNet, EfficientNet, and LipForensics models.

Result: Models trained on the age-diverse dataset showed fairer performance across age groups, improved accuracy, and better generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible, fairness-aware dataset and pipeline for future research in fairer deepfake detection.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized fashion styling is underexplored despite its potential to enhance shopping experiences.

Method: StyleTailor uses two core agents (Designer and Consultant) with iterative visual refinement via hierarchical vision-language model feedback and negative prompts.

Result: Outperforms baselines in personalized designs and recommendations, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: StyleTailor advances intelligent fashion systems with its closed-loop feedback mechanism and comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: The advancement of intelligent agents has revolutionized problem-solving
across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain
underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences.
In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework
that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation,
virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this
end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by
multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment.
Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for
personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs
are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback
spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop
mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency,
visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

TL;DR: A semi-automated framework (REC$\checkmark$D) is introduced to correct label errors in object detection datasets using crowdsourced microtasks, revealing significant annotation inaccuracies in KITTI and highlighting the limitations of current error detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label errors in object detection datasets compromise training and evaluation quality, but existing correction methods lack scalability and validation.

Method: REC$\checkmark$D combines error detection proposals with crowdsourced microtasks for independent verification and aggregation of annotations.

Result: Applied to KITTI, REC$\checkmark$D identified 24% missing/inaccurate annotations, creating a benchmark. Current methods miss 66% of errors and introduce new ones.

Conclusion: The framework improves label quality but underscores the need for better error detection methods, enabled by the released benchmark.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

*Simon Baur,Alexandra Benova,Emilio Dolgener Cantú,Jackie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPKD uses additional training-only modalities to enhance a unimodal vision model, improving ROI localization but not generalizing across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep learning model robustness in clinical practice by leveraging multiple data modalities, even when some are unavailable at inference.

Method: Proposes MMPKD, using text-based and tabular metadata-based teacher models to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model.

Result: MMPKD improves attention maps for ROI localization but lacks cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: MMPKD enhances unimodal models with privileged training data but has limited generalization.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

*Guanyu Hu,Dimitrios Kollias,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VEGA, a novel mechanism using CLIP's image encoder to create emotion-specific visual anchors for multimodal emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack psychologically meaningful priors for multimodal alignment, despite advanced fusion strategies.

Method: VEGA introduces visual emotion anchors via CLIP's image encoder, guided by cognitive theories, and uses stochastic anchor sampling for robustness.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.

Conclusion: VEGA enhances multimodal emotion recognition by grounding features in psychologically aligned visual semantics.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared latent space, treating brain subnetworks as tokens to match word tokens in reports, improving diagnosis of brain disorders like MCI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging multimodal brain imaging and clinical reports for better diagnosis, addressing the challenge of linking objective imaging with subjective text.

Method: Aligns brain connectomes and clinical reports in a shared latent space, treating subnetworks as tokens to match word tokens, applied to MCI using ADNI data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and identifies meaningful connectome-text pairs, revealing insights into Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

Conclusion: The framework enhances multimodal biomarker development and offers clinically useful insights for early diagnosis of brain disorders.

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Surformer v1, a transformer-based model for surface material recognition, integrates tactile and visual inputs, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface material recognition is crucial for robotic perception and interaction, especially with multimodal sensory inputs.

Method: Proposes Surformer v1 with modality-specific encoders and cross-modal attention, comparing tactile-only and multimodal (vision+tactile) approaches.

Result: Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with 0.77 ms inference time, outperforming other models in efficiency.

Conclusion: Surformer v1 balances accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost effectively for surface material recognition.

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks focus on video-based hate speech detection, especially for implicit hate. This work addresses the gap by creating a dedicated dataset and a robust detection method.

Method: A two-stage contrastive learning framework is proposed: (1) modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image trained with contrastive loss, and (2) cross-encoders to refine multimodal representations. Sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features are also incorporated.

Result: The method is evaluated on ImpliHateVid and HateMM datasets, showing effectiveness in detecting hateful content in videos. The dataset is highlighted as a significant contribution.

Conclusion: The work advances video-based hate speech detection, particularly for implicit hate, with a novel dataset and multimodal contrastive learning framework.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextGuard-LVLM is a new framework using Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to verify fine-grained cross-modal consistency in digital news, outperforming zero-shot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust methods to verify consistency between visual and textual information in digital news, addressing fine-grained contextual alignment beyond entity matching.

Method: Proposes ContextGuard-LVLM, leveraging LVLMs with multi-stage contextual reasoning and reinforced/adversarial learning. Extends datasets with fine-grained annotations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot LVLM baselines, excels in logical reasoning and contextual understanding, and shows robustness to perturbations.

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM effectively detects sophisticated context misalignments, validated by human expert agreement and superior performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

TL;DR: VL-MedGuide, a multi-modal framework using Visual-Language Large Models, improves skin disease diagnosis with interpretable results, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of diagnosing skin diseases due to complex visual features and lack of interpretability in current models.

Method: Two-stage framework: Multi-modal Concept Perception Module for feature description and Explainable Disease Reasoning Module for diagnosis with rationales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1 for diagnosis; 76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1 for concept detection) on Derm7pt dataset.

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide bridges AI performance and clinical utility with clear, actionable insights, validated by human evaluations.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

*Shilong Zou,Yuhang Huang,Renjiao Yi,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based cross-domain image translator is introduced, using joint learning to align diffusion and translation processes for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment between diffusion and translation processes in existing methods, which limits the effectiveness of diffusion models.

Method: Proposes a joint learning framework aligning diffusion and translation, using diffusion models to extract clean signals and a time-dependent translation network.

Result: Achieves better generative performance in RGB and cross-modality tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework enhances global optimization, improving fidelity and structural consistency in cross-domain image translation.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

TL;DR: A neural rendering framework improves specular reflection modeling by decomposing appearance into static neural basis and dynamic coefficients, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in rendering scenes with complex specular reflections and highlights in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) due to blurry reflections and optimization instability.

Method: Decomposes appearance into a static neural basis for material properties and dynamic coefficients from a Coefficient Network, combined by a Dynamic Radiance Integrator.

Result: Produces sharper, more realistic specular highlights compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The decomposition paradigm offers a flexible and effective approach for modeling complex appearance in neural scene representations.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Weihao Tang,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalNet improves micro-expression recognition (MER) robustness against key-frame index errors by using entire ME sequences and learning causal relationships between muscle movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing key-frame-based MER methods rely on accurate key-frame indexes, which are hard to obtain, limiting practical applications.

Method: CausalNet uses the entire ME sequence, CMPLM to locate muscle movement areas, and CAB to learn causal relationships between muscle contractions and relaxations.

Result: CausalNet achieves robust MER under key-frame index noise and outperforms SOTA methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalNet addresses key-frame index errors and redundancy, advancing MER towards practical use.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores in-generation watermarking for autoregressive (AR) image models, proposing two novel methods using visual token clustering to improve robustness against perturbations while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend in-generation watermarking to AR image models, addressing the gap in current research and improving robustness under common image perturbations.

Method: Two token-level watermarking methods: a training-free approach using a cluster lookup table and finetuning VAE encoders to predict token clusters from perturbed images.

Result: Cluster-level watermarks enhance robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks, with improved detectability and fast verification runtime.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the challenges of watermarking in AR models, offering practical solutions for detecting and attributing generated content.

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

TL;DR: Using line drawings for pretraining improves model efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned biases in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision systems rely on rich inputs, unlike humans who understand sparse representations like line drawings. This work explores structure-first learning for better visual understanding.

Method: Proposes line drawings as a pretraining modality, showing benefits in shape bias, attention, and data efficiency. Also introduces unsupervised "learning to draw" method.

Result: Models pretrained on line drawings exhibit stronger shape bias, lower intrinsic dimensionality, and better performance in classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: Structure-first learning with line drawings enhances efficiency, generalization, and robustness in vision systems, offering a simple yet powerful strategy.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

TL;DR: MMFformer, a multimodal depression detection network, improves early diagnosis by analyzing social media content, outperforming existing methods with significant F1-Score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of depression is challenging due to subjective clinical evaluations. Social media offers diverse data, but extracting relevant temporal and multimodal information is difficult.

Method: MMFformer uses transformer networks with residual connections for spatial features in videos and temporal dynamics in audio. It employs late and intermediate fusion strategies for intermodal correlations.

Result: The network outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F1-Scores by 13.92% (D-Vlog) and 7.74% (LMVD).

Conclusion: MMFformer effectively detects depression from multimodal social media data, offering a robust solution for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Motivation: To develop an efficient CGH framework for generating holograms from volumetric data, addressing noise and artifact issues.

Method: Reconstructs volumetric objects from point cloud and MRI data, then uses non-convex optimization (alternating projection, SGD, quasi-Newton) for POH and CH generation. Compares with HoloNet deep learning.

Result: Performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, PSNR) show improvement with 2D median filtering for noise and artifact reduction.

This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram
(POH) and complex-hologram (CH) generation using alternating projection, SGD,
and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

*Jixuan He,Chieh Hubert Lin,Lu Qi,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restage4D leverages real-world video motion priors to generate physically consistent 4D content, improving geometry and motion quality over synthetic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models lack physical realism for 4D scene synthesis, while real-world videos offer valuable motion and geometry cues.

Method: Uses a video-rewinding training strategy, occlusion-aware rigidity loss, and disocclusion backtracing to bridge real and synthetic motion.

Result: Demonstrates improved geometry consistency, motion quality, and 3D tracking on DAVIS and PointOdyssey datasets.

Conclusion: Restage4D preserves deformable structure and corrects generative model errors, highlighting the potential of video priors in 4D restaging.

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundBioNet, a SWIN-UNETR-based model, predicts IDH mutation in gliomas noninvasively using MRI, outperforming baselines with AUCs up to 90.58%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional invasive methods for IDH mutation detection fail to capture tumor heterogeneity, and existing deep learning models are limited by scarce annotated data.

Method: FoundBioNet uses SWIN-UNETR with Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) modules to analyze multi-parametric MRI for IDH mutation prediction.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on diverse test sets, outperforming baselines (p ≤ 0.05).

Conclusion: FoundBioNet enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, enabling personalized glioma care through noninvasive imaging.

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VOccl3D, a benchmark dataset for 3D human pose and shape estimation under realistic occlusions, addressing gaps in existing datasets. It fine-tunes HPS methods and improves performance on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HPS methods struggle with complex poses and occlusions, and current datasets lack realistic occlusion scenarios.

Method: Constructed VOccl3D using advanced rendering techniques, fine-tuned CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, and enhanced YOLO11 for human detection under occlusion.

Result: Significant improvements in HPS estimation and human detection under occlusion, validated on public datasets and VOccl3D.

Conclusion: VOccl3D provides a realistic benchmark for occlusion handling, advancing research in robust HPS estimation.

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

*Zihao Sheng,Zilin Huang,Yen-Jung Chen,Yansong Qu,Yuhao Luo,Yue Leng,Sikai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafePLUG enhances MLLMs for traffic accident analysis with pixel-level understanding and temporal grounding, outperforming existing methods on fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack fine-grained visual detail handling in traffic accident scenarios, limiting their practical use.

Method: Proposes SafePLUG, a framework supporting region-aware QA, pixel-level segmentation, and temporal event recognition.

Result: Achieves strong performance on region-based QA, segmentation, and temporal event localization.

Conclusion: SafePLUG advances fine-grained traffic scene understanding, improving safety and situational awareness in smart transportation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

*Noe Bertramo,Gabriel Duguey,Vivek Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffUS is a differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes realistic B-mode images from MRI scans, aiding intraoperative guidance by simulating ultrasound physics and incorporating artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve intraoperative ultrasound interpretation by bridging the gap between preoperative MRI/CT scans and real-time ultrasound guidance, addressing noise, artifacts, and alignment issues.

Method: DiffUS converts MRI 3D scans to acoustic impedance volumes, simulates ultrasound beam propagation via ray tracing, formulates wave propagation as a sparse linear system, and reconstructs B-mode images with realistic artifacts.

Result: Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset shows DiffUS generates anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain MRI data.

Conclusion: DiffUS successfully synthesizes realistic ultrasound images, enabling gradient-based optimization for applications like slice-to-volume registration and volumetric reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

### [36] [Edge Detection for Organ Boundaries via Top Down Refinement and SubPixel Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06805)
*Aarav Mehta,Priya Deshmukh,Vikram Singh,Siddharth Malhotra,Krishnan Menon Iyer,Tanvi Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel crisp edge detector for medical images improves boundary localization, enhancing segmentation, registration, and lesion delineation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise organ boundary localization is crucial in medical imaging, but existing ConvNet edge detectors lack the required accuracy.

Method: A top-down backward refinement architecture fuses high-level semantic features with low-level cues, extended for anisotropic volumes with 2D slice-wise refinement and light 3D context.

Result: Outperforms baseline ConvNet detectors and contemporary methods in boundary localization, improving downstream tasks like segmentation and registration.

Conclusion: The proposed method delivers clinically valuable, high-resolution organ edges, significantly enhancing medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

*Vikram Singh,Kabir Malhotra,Rohan Desai,Ananya Shankaracharya,Priyadarshini Chatterjee,Krishnan Menon Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dual-resolution architecture for melanocytic tumor segmentation in dermoscopic images, combining full-resolution and pooled streams with boundary-aware connections and attention modules, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation is crucial for skin cancer screening, but challenges include subtle variations, artifacts, and precise boundary needs.

Method: ResNet-inspired dual-resolution architecture with boundary-aware connections, channel attention, artifact suppression, and multi-task training.

Result: Improved boundary adherence and segmentation metrics on public benchmarks, enabling practical melanoma assessment.

Conclusion: The method offers pixel-accurate masks without heavy post-processing, making it viable for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework for subcutaneous vessel segmentation uses sparse annotations and probabilistic label propagation to reduce annotation burden while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels is challenging due to scarce ground truth and low contrast in clinical images.

Method: The method leverages sparse annotations (e.g., centerlines, dots) and expands them into dense supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation model. It jointly learns a CNN-based segmentation predictor and incorporates uncertainty-weighted loss and topology-aware regularization.

Result: The approach outperforms naive sparse label training and dense pseudo-labeling, producing more complete vascular maps and better-calibrated uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework reduces annotation burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology, improving usability for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE-reID introduces a source-free, cost-effective multi-source domain adaptation method for person re-identification, using low-rank adapters and a gating network for efficient cross-domain knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MSDA methods for person reID require domain-specific backbones or source data during adaptation, increasing computational costs and parameters.

Method: SAGE-reID trains source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) via source-free UDA and uses a lightweight gating network to dynamically merge LoRA experts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17) with minimal parameter growth (<= 2% of backbone).

Conclusion: SAGE-reID is efficient, scalable, and effective for multi-source domain adaptation in person reID.

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling

Abstract: Despite significant progress in image captioning, generating accurate and
descriptive captions remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, we
propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient
visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We
further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and
probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we
conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The
results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models
while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong
performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for image captioning.

*Mengxue Jia,Zhihua Allen-Zhao,You Zhao,Sanyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a joint sparse self-representation learning model for multiview clustering, using cardinality constraints for local information extraction and a low-rank constraint for global structure. It proposes an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method for convergence, outperforming eight state-of-the-art algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview clustering (MC) leverages consistent and complementary information across views. Subspace clustering, a key MC technique, needs improved methods to extract reliable local and global structures.

Method: A joint sparse self-representation model with cardinality constraints (ℓ₀-norm) replaces Graph-Laplacian regularization. AQP method ensures convergence for the nonconvex, nonsmooth model.

Result: The model and AQP method outperform eight state-of-the-art algorithms on six standard datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively extracts local and global structures in MC, with superior performance and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

*Jianxiang He,Shaoguang Wang,Weiyu Guo,Meisheng Hong,Jungang Li,Yijie Xu,Ziyang Chen,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSI improves keyframe retrieval for long videos by integrating subtitles and visual data, achieving SOTA performance in video-QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak multimodal alignment and lack of temporal semantic capture in existing keyframe retrieval methods hinder long video understanding.

Method: VSI uses a dual-stream search mechanism (Video Search Stream and Subtitle Match Stream) to integrate visual and textual data for better keyframe accuracy.

Result: VSI achieves 40.00% keyframe localization accuracy and 68.48% downstream video-QA accuracy, outperforming baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively.

Conclusion: VSI is robust and generalizable, setting SOTA in medium-to-long video-QA tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NS-FPN, a noise-suppression feature pyramid network for infrared small target detection, addressing false alarms by focusing on noise suppression in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to dim targets and background clutter. Existing CNN methods improve feature representation but increase false alarms.

Method: Proposes NS-FPN with a low-frequency guided feature purification (LFP) module for noise suppression and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module for feature fusion.

Result: NS-FPN significantly reduces false alarms and outperforms on public IRSTDS datasets.

Conclusion: The lightweight and effective NS-FPN can be integrated into existing frameworks, improving IRSTDS performance.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior

### [45] [BASIC: Boosting Visual Alignment with Intrinsic Refined Embeddings in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06895)
*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BASIC, a method to improve visual-text alignment in MLLMs by directly supervising the vision projector using refined visual embeddings from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack direct visual supervision for embeddings, limiting finer alignment between visual and textual modalities.

Method: BASIC uses refined visual embeddings from LLMs to guide the projector via angle reduction and semantic matching.

Result: BASIC significantly boosts MLLM performance across benchmarks without extra supervision.

Conclusion: Direct visual supervision via BASIC enhances visual-text alignment and MLLM effectiveness.

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

*Weiran Chen,Guiqian Zhu,Ying Li,Yi Ji,Chunping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey of deep learning-based Chinese font generation methods, categorizing them into many-shot and few-shot approaches, discussing their strengths, limitations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving the quality of generated Chinese characters and provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning techniques in this field.

Method: Literature selection and analysis, categorization of methods based on reference samples (many-shot vs. few-shot), and detailed review of fundamentals, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Identified strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlighting the need for better quality and efficiency in font generation.

Conclusion: Challenges remain in improving quality, and future research should focus on addressing these gaps, offering valuable insights for researchers.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

### [47] [eMotions: A Large-Scale Dataset and Audio-Visual Fusion Network for Emotion Analysis in Short-form Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06902)
*Xuecheng Wu,Dingkang Yang,Danlei Huang,Xinyi Yin,Yifan Wang,Jia Zhang,Jiayu Nie,Liangyu Fu,Yang Liu,Junxiao Xue,Hadi Amirpour,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces eMotions, a large-scale dataset for video emotion analysis (VEA) in short-form videos (SVs), and proposes AV-CANet, an audio-visual fusion network to address challenges like semantic gaps and emotional inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-form videos (SVs) are complex and lack emotion datasets, necessitating a robust solution for VEA.

Method: Proposes AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network with a Local-Global Fusion Module and EP-CE Loss for optimization.

Result: AV-CANet shows effectiveness across multiple datasets, including eMotions, and ablation studies validate its components.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable dataset and a novel method for VEA in SVs, offering insights for future research.

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

### [48] [A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904)
*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPF, a training-free COS framework that converts generic prompts into fine-grained instance masks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free COS methods using SAM produce coarse semantic masks, failing for multiple camouflaged instances. IAPF addresses this by generating instance-level masks.

Method: IAPF involves: (1) generating image-specific tags via MLLM, (2) producing instance-level prompts with Grounding DINO and SAM, and (3) voting for the most consistent mask.

Result: IAPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free COS methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: IAPF is a powerful, training-free solution for fine-grained camouflaged object segmentation.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

*Ruoxi Chen,Dongping Chen,Siyuan Wu,Sinan Wang,Shiyun Lang,Petr Sushko,Gaoyang Jiang,Yao Wan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiRef-bench, a framework for evaluating multi-reference image generation, and highlights the limitations of current models in handling multiple visual references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generative frameworks rely on single-source inputs, unlike human designers who draw from multiple visual references. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors develop MultiRef-bench, a dataset with synthetic and real-world samples, and evaluate three image-text models and six agentic frameworks.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with OmniGen achieving 66.6% (synthetic) and 79.0% (real-world) accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for more flexible, human-like creative tools capable of integrating multiple visual references.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

*Jinhao Li,Zijian Chen,Lirong Deng,Changbo Wang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMReID-Bench, a multi-task multi-modal benchmark for person re-identification (ReID), leveraging multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to address limitations of traditional uni-modal ReID models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person ReID models lack generalization in multi-modal data (e.g., RGB, thermal, infrared). MLLMs offer potential but are underutilized as mere feature extractors or caption generators.

Method: The authors propose MMReID-Bench, a benchmark with 20,710 multi-modal queries and gallery images across 10 ReID tasks, to evaluate MLLMs' reasoning and cross-modal understanding.

Result: Experiments show MLLMs' effectiveness in versatile ReID but highlight limitations with thermal and infrared data.

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench aims to advance robust, generalizable multi-modal foundation models for person ReID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Image is a multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogues, addressing intention drift and incoherence in single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image systems struggle with iterative, multi-turn tasks, leading to intention drift and incoherent edits.

Method: Talk2Image integrates intention parsing, task decomposition across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement via multi-view evaluation.

Result: The system outperforms baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction for iterative tasks.

Conclusion: Talk2Image effectively aligns with user intentions and ensures consistent image editing in multi-turn scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-GRPO integrates online RL training into autoregressive image generation models, improving image quality and human preference over standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autoregressive image generation models by leveraging RL, inspired by its success in refining LLMs.

Method: Adapts the GRPO algorithm with reward functions evaluating perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity.

Result: Significant improvements in image quality and human preference across class- and text-conditional tasks.

Conclusion: RL-based optimization is viable for AR image generation, enabling controllable and high-quality synthesis.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large
language models (LLMs), we propose AR-GRPO, an approach to integrate online RL
training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

*Weiyan Xie,Han Gao,Didan Deng,Kaican Li,April Hua Liu,Yongxiang Huang,Nevin L. Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CannyEdit improves text-to-image editing by balancing text adherence, context fidelity, and seamless integration using Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.

Method: CannyEdit uses Selective Canny Control for precise edits and Dual-Prompt Guidance for coherent scene interactions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 2.93 to 10.49% in balance and achieves higher seamlessness (49.2% vs. 76.08-89.09% detection rate).

Conclusion: CannyEdit offers a superior training-free solution for regional image editing with improved adherence, fidelity, and seamlessness.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first Sign Language Production Challenge to standardize evaluation metrics for SLP, using the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset. The winning method achieved high scores with a retrieval-based framework and pre-trained language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized evaluation metrics for Sign Language Production (SLP) systems hinders meaningful comparisons across different approaches.

Method: The challenge evaluated architectures for Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation using the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset and a custom hidden test set.

Result: 33 participants submitted 231 solutions, with the top team achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574.

Conclusion: The challenge and released evaluation network aim to establish a consistent baseline for future SLP research.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

### [55] [Beyond Frequency: Seeing Subtle Cues Through the Lens of Spatial Decomposition for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06959)
*Qin Xu,Lili Zhu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a method for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that adaptively enhances spatial-domain features, overcoming limitations of fixed-scale frequency-domain approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frequency-domain methods lack adaptability to image content and dynamic feature extraction, limiting their effectiveness in FGVC.

Method: SCOPE uses two modules: Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE) for dynamic detail enhancement and Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR) for semantic refinement, cascaded for progressive feature fusion.

Result: SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines local details and global semantics, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

*Qiwei Tian,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Qian Li,Shuai Liu,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViPro, the first adversarial attack for promoting videos in text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), and proposes Modal Refinement (MoRe) to enhance transferability. It demonstrates superior performance over baselines and highlights vulnerabilities in T2VR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2VR attacks focus on suppressing video ranks, but promoting videos is more impactful for financial or misinformation gains. This gap motivates the study.

Method: The authors propose ViPro for adversarial video promotion and MoRe to improve black-box transferability by refining cross-modal interactions.

Result: ViPro outperforms baselines by over 30%/10%/4% in white/grey/black-box settings, validated on 3 models and 3 datasets.

Conclusion: The work uncovers a critical vulnerability in T2VR, provides bounds for attacks, and suggests countermeasures. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods (Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT) on real images with >180° FoV, comparing performance across varying FoVs and proposing a depth-based initialization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how fisheye-based 3DGS methods handle extreme distortion in real-world settings and improve initialization for challenging scenes.

Method: Evaluated Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT on indoor/outdoor scenes with 200° fisheye cameras, tested varying FoVs (200°, 160°, 120°), and proposed a depth-based initialization using UniK3D predictions.

Result: Fisheye-GS performs better with reduced FoV (160°), while 3DGUT maintains stability and quality at 200°. UniK3D enables high-quality reconstruction despite not being trained on fisheye data.

Conclusion: Fisheye-based 3DGS methods are viable for wide-angle 3D reconstruction, even with sparse, distortion-heavy inputs.

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

TL;DR: WeatherDiffusion is a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering in autonomous driving scenes, addressing challenges from weather and lighting. It uses intrinsic maps and text guidance for control and outperforms benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex weather and illumination in autonomous driving scenes challenge rendering tasks. Current diffusion models lack control and robustness.

Method: Proposes WeatherDiffusion with Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) for high-quality inverse rendering. Uses synthetic (WeatherSynthetic) and real-world (WeatherReal) datasets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks and improves robustness in downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion effectively handles diverse weather and lighting conditions, enhancing rendering and downstream tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

### [59] [TADoc: Robust Time-Aware Document Image Dewarping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06988)
*Fangmin Zhao,Weichao Zeng,Zhenhang Li,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TADoc, a lightweight framework for document image dewarping, modeling it as a dynamic process and proposing a new metric (DLS) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex document structures and high deformation in real-world scenarios, prompting a need for a progressive approach.

Method: Reformulates dewarping as a dynamic process with intermediate states and designs TADoc, a time-aware network. Introduces DLS for better evaluation.

Result: TADoc shows strong robustness and outperforms benchmarks across various document types and distortion levels.

Conclusion: The dynamic modeling and DLS metric enhance dewarping effectiveness, with TADoc proving superior in real-world applications.

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

*Nick Lemke,John Kalkhof,Niklas Babendererde,Anirban Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA, a bio-inspired model, segments large medical inputs efficiently by leveraging an octree data structure and CUDA implementation, reducing VRAM usage by 90% compared to UNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation tasks require processing large inputs (e.g., MRIs, pathology slices) with global context, but current models like UNets or Vision Transformers are VRAM-intensive and inefficient.

Method: Proposes OctreeNCA, generalizing Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) with an octree neighborhood for global knowledge traversal, and implements a CUDA-based inference function for efficiency.

Result: OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos with 90% less VRAM than UNets, enabling processing of 184 Megapixel slices or 1-minute videos at once.

Conclusion: OctreeNCA offers a scalable, efficient solution for large medical segmentation tasks, addressing VRAM bottlenecks while maintaining global consistency.

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2-UniSeg introduces a fast pseudo-mask algorithm (UniAP) and a continuous pretraining framework for self-supervised universal segmentation, outperforming SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised segmentation models require time-consuming pseudo-mask generation, hindering scalability and optimization.

Method: Proposes Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP) for rapid pseudo-mask generation and S2-UniSeg with QuerySD for continuous pretraining.

Result: Outperforms UnSAM with AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes.

Conclusion: S2-UniSeg scales efficiently and achieves superior performance, validated on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

*Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Yiwei Hu,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMat is a diffusion-based framework for generating 4K SVBRDFs efficiently, using a CrossStitch module to maintain consistency across maps without heavy modifications to the DiT backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for detailed SVBRDFs in 3D content creation and the potential of high-resolution text-to-image models like DiT for this task, while addressing challenges of consistency and efficiency.

Method: Introduces HiMat with a CrossStitch module to capture inter-map dependencies lightly, preserving the DiT backbone's capabilities.

Result: HiMat successfully generates 4K SVBRDFs with structural coherence and high-frequency details, validated by text prompts.

Conclusion: HiMat is effective for SVBRDF generation and shows promise for tasks like intrinsic decomposition.

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

TL;DR: TerraMAE is a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) encoding framework designed to improve spatial-spectral embedding learning for geospatial analyses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised Masked Autoencoders struggle with hyperspectral imagery due to its complex spatial-spectral correlations, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: TerraMAE uses adaptive channel grouping based on spectral similarities and an enhanced reconstruction loss with spatial-spectral quality metrics.

Result: TerraMAE achieves superior spatial-spectral information preservation and performs well on crop identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Conclusion: TerraMAE effectively addresses the challenges of hyperspectral imagery, offering high-quality representations for diverse geospatial tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

TL;DR: DocRefine is a framework for intelligent understanding and refinement of scientific PDFs using a multi-agent system, outperforming baselines in semantic consistency, layout fidelity, and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for advanced tools to handle complex PDF layouts and multimodal content, as traditional methods and direct LLM/LVLM applications lack precision.

Method: DocRefine uses a multi-agent system with six specialized agents for tasks like layout analysis, content understanding, refinement, and verification.

Result: Achieves 86.7% SCS, 93.9% LFI, and 85.0% IAR on DocEditBench, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DocRefine advances automated scientific document processing with superior semantic and visual consistency.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates
advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding,
summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in
handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks
precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces
DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding,
content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents,
driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of
advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent
system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic
accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench
dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across
various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score
(SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction
Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability
in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity,
and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in
automated scientific document processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with Complex VQA due to reliance on high-level global features, lacking fine-grained reasoning.

Method: MV-CoRe integrates global embeddings (VLMs/LLMs) with fine-grained features (object/scene graphs) using a Multimodal Fusion Transformer.

Result: Achieves 77.5% accuracy on GQA, surpassing LVLMs, with ablation studies confirming feature importance.

Conclusion: MV-CoRe excels in Complex VQA by combining diverse features, validated by human evaluations for factual correctness and reasoning depth.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse
visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global
embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large
Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including
object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and
reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and
conceptual understanding.

TL;DR: FOCUS-Med, a novel method for polyp segmentation in endoscopic images, combines graph-based and attention mechanisms to improve accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of low contrast, specular highlights, and indistinct boundaries in endoscopic images complicates polyp segmentation, crucial for early colorectal cancer detection.

Method: FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual-GCN module for spatial and structural dependencies, location-fused self-attention for global context, and a weighted fusion strategy for multi-scale aggregation. It also uses an LLM for qualitative evaluation.

Result: FOCUS-Med outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks, excelling in five key metrics.

Conclusion: The method shows strong clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy, enhancing polyp segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

*Yueyu Hu,Ran Gong,Tingyu Fan,Yao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation for high-quality rendering and efficient compression, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D representations (point clouds, meshes, 3D Gaussians) have limitations in rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility.

Method: TeSO organizes cube-bounded surfels on an octree, each with a texture patch, reducing primitives while retaining texture details. A compression scheme leverages the octree structure.

Result: TeSO achieves higher rendering quality at lower bit-rates compared to point cloud and 3D Gaussian baselines.

Conclusion: TeSO is a versatile and efficient 3D representation for streaming applications, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

TL;DR: ForeSight is a joint detection and forecasting framework for autonomous vehicles, outperforming traditional methods by integrating temporal cues and eliminating explicit object association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods treat detection and forecasting separately, missing opportunities to leverage temporal cues, which ForeSight aims to address.

Method: ForeSight uses a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach with forecast-aware detection and streaming forecast transformers, avoiding explicit object association.

Result: On the nuScenes dataset, ForeSight achieves a 54.9% EPA, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, and leads in mAP and minADE.

Conclusion: ForeSight sets a new benchmark for joint detection and forecasting in autonomous vehicles, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

TL;DR: Hybrid collaboration (HyComm) optimizes 3D detection by adaptively combining compact perceptual outputs and rich raw observations, achieving superior performance-bandwidth trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between detection performance and communication bandwidth in collaborative 3D detection.

Method: Proposes HyComm, integrating perceptual outputs and raw observations, prioritizing critical data and using standardized formats for adaptability.

Result: Outperforms prior methods, achieving a 2,006× lower communication volume while maintaining higher AP50 on DAIR-V2X.

Conclusion: HyComm offers adaptable, efficient collaboration for diverse communication scenarios, independent of detection models.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard lifting-based methods for 3D HPE generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings.

Method: AugLift enriches 2D keypoints with confidence scores and depth estimates from pre-trained models, integrating seamlessly into existing architectures.

Result: Boosts cross-dataset performance by 10.1% and in-distribution performance by 4.0%.

Conclusion: AugLift offers a practical, modular solution to improve generalization in lifting-based pose estimation models.

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The study evaluates GANs and DMs for synthesizing chest X-rays with abnormalities, finding DMs more realistic but GANs better for specific conditions. Radiologists' insights highlight gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical imaging, especially for rare anomalies, and assess the clinical utility of synthetic images.

Method: Evaluated GANs and DMs using real images from MIMIC-CXR and synthetic images. Conducted a reader study with radiologists to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess abnormality consistency.

Result: DMs produced more realistic images overall, while GANs performed better for specific conditions like ECS absence. Radiologists identified visual cues for detecting synthetic images.

Conclusion: GANs and DMs have complementary strengths, but further refinement is needed for reliable use in augmenting training datasets for AI diagnostics.

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMAMRNet, a novel network for mural restoration, improves quality by integrating mask-aware up/down-sampling and multi-scale feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Murals deteriorate due to environmental and human factors, requiring digital restoration that preserves authenticity. Existing methods lack consistent mask guidance, leading to poor restoration.

Method: CMAMRNet uses Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS) for consistent mask sensitivity and Co-Feature Aggregator (CFA) for multi-scale feature extraction.

Result: CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, preserving structural and artistic details in murals.

Conclusion: The proposed CMAMRNet effectively addresses mural restoration challenges, offering superior results and preserving authenticity.

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both

### [73] [Dynamic Pattern Alignment Learning for Pretraining Lightweight Human-Centric Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07144)
*Xuanhan Wang,Huimin Deng,Ke Liu,Jun Wang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAL is a distillation-based pretraining framework for lightweight human-centric vision models (HVMs) that achieves strong generalization by aligning visual patterns at multiple levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large HVMs require massive pretraining data and complex architectures, limiting practicality. DPAL aims to distill knowledge from large HVMs into lightweight models efficiently.

Method: DPAL uses a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe) with three experts for global identity, local shape, and multi-person interaction patterns. It aligns lightweight and large HVMs at image, pixel, and relation levels.

Result: DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) matches large HVMs like PATH-B (84M) and outperforms other distillation methods on 15 datasets.

Conclusion: DPAL enables lightweight HVMs to generalize effectively, bridging the gap with large models while being practical for real-world use.

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

*Yu Liu,Zhijie Liu,Xiao Ren,You-Fu Li,He Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates short-term and long-term motion intentions, improving accuracy by modeling intent explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack explicit semantic modeling of pedestrian intent, leading to misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy.

Method: Combines short-term intent (residual polar representation) and long-term intent (token-based endpoint predictor) with adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor in the diffusion process.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances trajectory prediction by integrating intent modeling and refining the diffusion process.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

### [75] [SketchAnimator: Animate Sketch via Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07149)
*Ruolin Yang,Da Li,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SketchAnimator, a model for animating sketches by integrating appearance and motion from a reference video into a pre-trained T2V model, producing dynamic sketch videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animating sketches is time-consuming and requires professional skills, making it challenging for amateurs. The goal is to simplify this process.

Method: The model divides sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning, and Video Prior Distillation, using LoRA and Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).

Result: The model successfully generates sketch videos that retain the original sketch appearance while mimicking the reference video's motion.

Conclusion: SketchAnimator effectively addresses one-shot motion customization, outperforming alternative approaches.

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

*Xiaotong Lin,Tianming Liang,Jian-Fang Hu,Kun-Yu Lin,Yulei Kang,Chunwei Tian,Jianhuang Lai,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoopDiff decouples human and object motion modeling for 3D HOI anticipation, using contact points as anchors and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works ignore the distinct motion patterns of humans and objects, treating them uniformly. CoopDiff addresses this by decoupling their motion modeling.

Method: Uses two distinct branches for human and object motion, bridged by shared contact points with consistency constraints. Includes a human-driven interaction module for enhanced coherence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets.

Conclusion: CoopDiff effectively models distinct human and object motions, improving 3D HOI anticipation accuracy.

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multi-scale feature extraction in lightweight networks without compromising performance.

Method: Proposes LMF layers with depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure, integrated into LMFNet.

Result: LMFNet achieves competitive performance on five benchmarks with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming traditional and lightweight models.

Conclusion: LMFNet effectively balances efficiency and performance, offering potential for broader image processing applications.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

*Huihui Xu,Jiashi Lin,Haoyu Chen,Junjun He,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventRR framework decouples RVOS into object summarization and referent reasoning, using a Referential Event Graph (REG) for semantic structure, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods overlook semantic structure in referring expressions, which is crucial for reasoning, especially with video-referring expressions involving event attributes and temporal relations.

Method: EventRR splits RVOS into object summarization (bottleneck tokens aggregation) and referent reasoning (REG-based Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning).

Result: EventRR outperforms state-of-the-art RVOS methods across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: EventRR effectively addresses the complexity of video-referring expressions by leveraging semantic structure and temporal reasoning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration leverages depth information to improve quality, addressing limitations like attention distractions and excessive background enhancement. It includes a novel dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods often ignore depth information, leading to issues in similarity matching and attention in varying depth-of-field scenarios.

Method: DGN combines a depth estimation branch for structural guidance and an image restoration branch using progressive window-based self-attention and sparse non-local attention. Joint training enhances both depth and restoration features.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, validated by a new high-resolution dataset.

Conclusion: DGN effectively integrates depth guidance for superior image restoration, demonstrating robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised real-world super-resolution method using rectified flow and Fourier priors to model degradation, improving SR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of generalizing from synthetic to real-world data due to unknown degradation distributions.

Method: Introduces Rectified Flow Degradation Module (RFDM) and Fourier Prior Guided Degradation Module (FGDM) to model degradation and generate realistic LR-HR pairs.

Result: Enhances performance of existing SR methods in real-world scenarios, as shown by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures real-world degradation, improving unsupervised SR results.

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

*Songlin Li,Zhiqing Guo,Yuanman Li,Zeyu Li,Yunfeng Diao,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cognition-inspired multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net) improves image manipulation localization by integrating visual and semantic textual features from LLMs, addressing semantic gaps and boundary preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IML models rely on visual cues but neglect semantic relationships, which are crucial for detecting manipulated regions.

Method: CMB-Net uses LLMs for semantic analysis, an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM) to weight text features, an image-text interaction module (ITIM) for feature alignment, and a restoration edge decoder (RED) for boundary preservation.

Result: CMB-Net outperforms existing IML models in experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic and visual features with boundary preservation enhances IML accuracy.

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

*Yuqi Han,Qi Cai,Yuanxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid camera calibration method combining generic and parametric models is proposed to address pose ambiguity and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric models rely on user experience and may lack accuracy, while generic methods are complex and lack intrinsic parameters. Pose ambiguity in generic methods affects pose estimation.

Method: A linear solver and nonlinear optimization address pose ambiguity. A global optimization hybrid method integrates generic and parametric models.

Result: The hybrid method improves extrinsic parameter accuracy, mitigates overfitting, and performs well across lens types and noise.

Conclusion: The hybrid method is a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a landmark-guided visual feature extractor for visual speech recognition, reducing reliance on large datasets and improving accuracy for unseen speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for visual speech recognition are affected by visual disturbances and require large datasets. The paper aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging facial landmarks.

Method: A landmark-guided feature extractor uses facial landmarks as auxiliary data. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network and multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework combine landmark and visual features.

Result: The method performs well with limited data and improves accuracy on unseen speakers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces user-specific feature influence and enhances performance without extensive data or resources.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASM-UNet is a Mamba-based model for fine-grained segmentation (FGS) that uses adaptive scan scores to dynamically adjust scanning orders, outperforming existing methods on public and new datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coarse-grained segmentation methods struggle with fine-grained segmentation due to individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Fixed scanning orders in Mamba-based models further limit adaptability.

Method: ASM-UNet introduces adaptive scan scores, combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations to dynamically guide scanning orders.

Result: ASM-UNet achieves superior performance on public datasets (ACDC, Synapse) and a new biliary tract FGS dataset (BTMS).

Conclusion: ASM-UNet effectively addresses the challenges of FGS by dynamically adapting to individual variations, demonstrating strong performance in both coarse and fine-grained segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

TL;DR: MiraMo enhances image animation by improving efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness using linear attention, motion residual learning, and DCT-based noise refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image animation methods struggle with appearance consistency, abrupt motion transitions, and computational inefficiency compared to text-to-video approaches.

Method: MiraMo introduces a text-to-video architecture with linear attention, motion residual learning for temporal consistency, and DCT-based noise refinement for smooth motion.

Result: MiraMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with faster inference.

Conclusion: MiraMo is a versatile framework for high-quality image animation, validated by experiments and applications in motion transfer and video editing.

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve hyperspectral video tracking by addressing spectral interactions, using Transformers and a spectral loss for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods overlook spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance in HSVs.

Method: Uses Transformers for band-wise spatial relationships and set theory for spectral interactions, plus a spectral loss for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates spectral and spatial cues, with code and models available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

It includes 927K QA pairs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and 12 dynamic tasks. A proposed framework outperforms baselines in spatio-temporal reasoning.

Motivation: Existing egocentric datasets lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, particularly for object and human motion and interactions.

Method: Introduces EgoDynamic4D with RGB-D video, camera poses, instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. Proposes an end-to-end spatio-temporal reasoning framework using instance-aware feature encoding, time/camera encoding, and adaptive down-sampling.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms baselines on EgoDynamic4D, demonstrating effective multimodal temporal modeling.

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D and the proposed framework advance egocentric dynamic scene understanding, enabling verifiable, step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A collaborative framework (SLC) combines small and large VLMs for efficient personalization, leveraging small VLMs for personalized data and large VLMs for reasoning, with a reflection strategy to avoid errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are costly and restricted, while small VLMs lack reasoning. SLC bridges this gap for efficient personalization.

Method: SLC uses small VLMs for personalized info and large VLMs for integration, with a test-time reflection strategy to prevent errors.

Result: SLC is training-efficient and works with both open and closed-source VLMs, validated across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SLC is a novel, efficient framework enabling broader personalized applications for VLMs.

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHAIV integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental fine-tuning for autonomous knowledge updates in open-world recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection and incremental learning methods are limited in open-world scenarios, lacking knowledge updates and requiring supervision.

Method: Proposes OpenHAIV, a unified framework combining OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning.

Result: Enables models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments.

Conclusion: OpenHAIV addresses limitations of current methods, offering a practical solution for open-world recognition.

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

TL;DR: A unified feature visualization framework for CNNs and ViTs, extending to intermediate layers for deeper insights and exploring adversarial example generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model interpretability by understanding internal feature representations in DNNs, inspired by neuroscience methods.

Method: Uses Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize inputs for strong neuron responses, applied to both CNNs and ViTs, including intermediate layers.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in CNNs and ViTs, revealing hierarchical feature structures and potential vulnerabilities via adversarial examples.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well and provides valuable interpretive insights for DNNs.

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

*Zhiqiang Shen,Peng Cao,Xiaoli Liu,Jinzhu Yang,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynMatch addresses label scarcity in medical image segmentation by synthesizing images to match pseudo labels, avoiding inconsistencies and improving performance in low-annotation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity in medical image segmentation limits deep learning performance. Pseudo supervision methods suffer from inconsistencies between pseudo labels and unlabeled images.

Method: SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features from the segmentation model generating pseudo labels, ensuring consistency without additional training.

Result: SynMatch outperforms strong-weak pseudo supervision by 29.71% and 10.05% in polyp segmentation with 5% and 10% scribble annotations, excelling in BSL settings.

Conclusion: SynMatch effectively mitigates label scarcity by synthesizing consistent image-label pairs, achieving superior performance in low-annotation scenarios.

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing efficient architectures with large receptive fields for semantic understanding and detailed contour refinement.

Method: Uses LKA, SDLSKA, CKS, DLKPPM, and BGAF modules to expand receptive fields, adapt dynamically, and enhance boundary delineation.

Result: Achieves 79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU with pretraining on Cityscapes at 33 FPS.

Conclusion: BEVANet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in real-time semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video pre-trained models are inefficient for mobile devices, lacking lightweight architectures.

Result: MobileViCLIP-Small is significantly faster (55.4x and 6.7x) than competitors and matches or outperforms them in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: MobileViCLIP bridges the gap for efficient video-text models on mobile devices, offering speed and performance.

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to
their faster reasoning speed and easier deployment on mobile devices. However,
existing video pre-trained models still focus on the common ViT architecture
with high latency, and few works attempt to build efficient architecture on
mobile devices. This paper bridges this gap by introducing temporal structural
reparameterization into an efficient image-text model and training it on a
large-scale high-quality video-text dataset, resulting in an efficient
video-text model that can run on mobile devices with strong zero-shot

particular, in terms of inference speed on mobile devices, our
MobileViCLIP-Small is 55.4x times faster than InternVideo2-L14 and 6.7x faster
than InternVideo2-S14. In terms of zero-shot retrieval performance, our
MobileViCLIP-Small obtains similar performance as InternVideo2-L14 and obtains

TL;DR: DocR1, an MLLM trained with EviGRPO, improves multi-page document understanding using RL and evidence-aware rewards, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multi-page document understanding in MLLMs, which requires fine-grained visual and multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Introduces EviGRPO, an RL framework with evidence-aware rewards, and a two-stage annotation pipeline with curriculum learning.

Result: DocR1 achieves SOTA on multi-page tasks and maintains strong performance on single-page benchmarks.

Conclusion: EviGRPO and DocR1 effectively enhance multi-page document understanding with limited supervision.

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RORPCap is a retrieval-based method for image captioning that uses object and relation prompts, CLIP embeddings, and GPT-2, achieving competitive performance with minimal training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object detectors or GCNs, which suffer from redundancy, complex construction, and high costs. RORPCap leverages image-text retrieval for richer semantics.

Method: Extracts object/relation words, embeds them into prompts, maps CLIP image embeddings to visual-text embeddings, and uses GPT-2 for caption generation.

Result: Achieves 120.5% CIDEr and 22.0% SPICE scores on MS-COCO with only 2.6 hours of training, matching detector/GCN-based models.

Conclusion: RORPCap is a fast, efficient alternative for image captioning, outperforming traditional methods in training efficiency.

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Planner-Refiner is a framework for video-language alignment, refining visual representations iteratively with language guidance to minimize semantic gaps. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity of aligning evolving visual entities and action chains with language in videos, which involves semantic gaps.

Method: Uses a Planner module to decompose language prompts into short chains and a Refiner to guide visual token self-attention across space and time iteratively.

Result: Superior performance on Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding tasks, especially with complex prompts.

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner effectively bridges semantic gaps in video-language alignment, demonstrating strong potential for handling complex language prompts.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAR is a novel framework for customized image generation using frozen pre-trained AR models, achieving efficiency and performance with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for customized generation are costly and prone to overfitting or forgetting, motivating the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: CoAR injects subject concepts into AR models using Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning and introduces regularization to prevent overfitting and language drift.

Result: CoAR achieves superior performance in subject and style personalization with less than 0.05% parameter tuning, outperforming Proxy-Tuning.

Conclusion: CoAR offers an efficient, high-performing solution for customized image generation while preserving pre-trained model integrity.

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

*Tingyu Yang,Jue Gong,Jinpei Guo,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODiff is a semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal, leveraging semantic guidance and adaptive denoising to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based methods for JPEG artifact removal often fail to recover complex textures, leading to over-smoothed results.

Method: SODiff uses a semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE) and a quality factor-aware time predictor to guide a pre-trained diffusion model for artifact removal.

Result: SODiff achieves superior visual quality and quantitative metrics compared to recent leading methods.

Conclusion: SODiff effectively addresses JPEG artifact removal by combining semantic guidance and adaptive denoising, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

TL;DR: GS4Buildings improves 2D Gaussian Splatting for urban scenes by using semantic 3D building models, achieving better completeness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D Gaussian Splatting struggles with large-scale urban scenes due to occlusions, leading to incomplete reconstructions.

Method: Leverages semantic 3D building models for initialization, incorporates prior depth/normal maps, and offers a building-focused mode for efficiency.

Result: Improves reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%, with a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian primitives.

Conclusion: Semantic building model integration enhances GS-based reconstruction for urban applications like smart cities and digital twins.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

TL;DR: A novel method using modular decomposition and a Feature Tailor addresses cross-sensor degradation in pansharpening, achieving fast training and inference without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for pansharpening struggle with cross-sensor generalization, and current solutions are time-consuming or require extra data.

Method: Modular decomposition identifies a critical interface for feature mapping, where a Feature Tailor is integrated. It uses physics-aware unsupervised losses and patch-wise training for efficiency.

Result: The method achieves sub-second training and inference, outperforming prior methods in speed and generalization, as demonstrated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers superior generalization and efficiency, making it a practical solution for cross-sensor pansharpening challenges.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

### [103] [DIP-GS: Deep Image Prior For Gaussian Splatting Sparse View Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07372)
*Rajaei Khatib,Raja Giryes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIP-GS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for sparse-view reconstruction using Deep Image Prior (DIP), achieving SOTA results without pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with sparse-view reconstruction due to limited input views. DIP-GS aims to address this by leveraging DIP's internal patterns.

Method: DIP-GS integrates DIP with 3DGS in a coarse-to-fine manner, using only input frames without pre-trained models.

Result: DIP-GS achieves competitive SOTA results in sparse-view reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: DIP-GS effectively improves 3DGS for sparse-view scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

*Rui Chen,Xingyu Chen,Shaoan Wang,Shihan Kong,Junzhi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LET-US is a framework for interpreting long event streams with text, using adaptive compression and a two-stage optimization to bridge the modality gap and improve cross-modal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with interpreting event streams or handling long sequences, limiting their application in event-based visual perception.

Method: LET-US employs adaptive compression, text-guided cross-modal queries, hierarchical clustering, and similarity computation to distill representative event features. It uses a two-stage optimization and a large-scale event-text dataset for training.

Result: LET-US outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and semantic comprehension for long-duration event streams.

Conclusion: The framework advances cross-modal understanding of event streams and sets a new benchmark for event-text comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

### [105] [ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07402)
*Rongxuan Peng,Shunquan Tan,Chenqi Kong,Anwei Luo,Alex C. Kot,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicsSAM is a robust framework for image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) that addresses adversarial vulnerabilities in PEFT-based methods by integrating forgery and adversary experts, along with a lightweight detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based approaches for adapting large vision models to IFDL tasks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which degrade performance.

Method: The framework introduces forgery experts to capture forgery artifacts, a lightweight adversary detector for identifying adversarial images, and adversary experts to correct feature shifts caused by adversarial noise.

Result: ForensicsSAM outperforms existing methods in resisting adversarial attacks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in IFDL tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances adversarial robustness while maintaining high performance in forgery detection and localization.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CharacterShot is a framework for creating 4D character animations from a single image and 2D pose sequence, using a 2D-to-3D lifting approach and 4D Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable individual designers to create dynamic 3D character animations easily, leveraging a single reference image and 2D pose sequence.

Method: Pretrains a 2D animation model, lifts it to 3D with dual-attention and camera prior, and optimizes with 4D Gaussian splatting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the new CharacterBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CharacterShot provides a robust solution for 4D character animation, supported by a large dataset and public release of resources.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

*Youqi Wang,Shunquan Tan,Rongxuan Peng,Bin Li,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE repurposes Stable Diffusion 3 and Segment Anything Model to detect and localize digital forgeries by amplifying inconsistencies and leveraging semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated forgeries threatens digital media authenticity, necessitating advanced detection tools.

Method: CLUE uses LoRA to adapt SD3 for forensic feature extraction, injects noise to highlight inconsistencies, and integrates SAM for semantic context.

Result: CLUE outperforms prior methods in generalization and robustness against attacks and OSNs.

Conclusion: CLUE is a highly effective, parameter-efficient solution for forgery detection and localization.

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/SZAISEC/CLUE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gender bias in Vision Language Models (VLMs), introduces debiasing methods (CDA and DAUDoS), and identifies bias sources in vision and text encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs inherit gender biases from training data, but the contributions of vision and text modalities to these biases are unclear.

Method: Targeted debiasing using Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and a novel method, DAUDoS, with a new metric (Degree of Stereotypicality).

Result: CDA reduces gender gap by 6%, DAUDoS by 3% with less data. CLIP's vision encoder is more biased; PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased.

Conclusion: Identifying bias sources enables targeted mitigation in future multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

### [109] [Levarging Learning Bias for Noisy Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07441)
*Yuxin Zhang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yihan Sun,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD) leverages learning bias to filter contaminated training data and improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world training data often contains unlabeled anomalies, degrading conventional methods that assume anomaly-free data.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage 1 partitions training data, trains sub-models, and aggregates scores to filter anomalies. Stage 2 trains the final detector on purified data.

Result: Superior anomaly detection and localization on the Real-IAD benchmark, with resilience to noise.

Conclusion: The framework's model-agnostic design and learning bias exploitation offer a practical solution for imperfect training data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is
available at https://github.com/hustzhangyuxin/LLBNAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study benchmarks waste classification models for HCW in Nepal, finding YOLOv5-s most accurate (95.06%) but slightly slower than YOLOv8-n. EfficientNet-B0 was slower but promising (93.22%). YOLOv5-s was deployed for public use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improper HCW management in Nepal risks contamination, disease spread, and waste handlers' safety, necessitating better classification methods.

Method: Benchmarked ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n, and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold (5 folds) on HCW data. Used ANOVA for statistical significance.

Result: YOLOv5-s achieved highest accuracy (95.06%) but was slightly slower than YOLOv8-n. EfficientNet-B0 had 93.22% accuracy but highest inference time.

Conclusion: YOLOv5-s was deployed for public use with Nepal's HCW standards. Future work includes improving data and local context.

Abstract: The increasing number of Health Care facilities in Nepal has also added up
the challenges on managing health care waste (HCW). Improper segregation and
disposal of HCW leads to the contamination, spreading of infectious diseases
and puts a risk of waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art
waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S,
YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold techniques where we use 5 folds
on combined HCW data, and found that the YOLOv5-s achieved higher of 95.06%
accuracy but fell short few milliseconds in inference speed with YOLOv8-n
model. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took
the highest inference time. A repetitive ANOVA was performed to see statistical
significance and the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web
with mapped bin color using Nepal's HCW management standards for public usage.
Further work on the data was suggested along with localized context.

*Siminfar Samakoush Galougah,Rishie Raj,Sanjoy Chowdhury,Sayan Nag,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURA is a new benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in AV-LLMs and OLMs, focusing on six cognitive domains to ensure genuine comprehension. It introduces AuraScore to assess reasoning fidelity, revealing a gap between model accuracy and reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV benchmarks prioritize accuracy over reasoning, making it hard to distinguish genuine comprehension from flawed reasoning or hallucinations.

Method: AURA includes questions across six cognitive domains, unanswerable from a single modality, and proposes AuraScore to evaluate reasoning fidelity via Factual Consistency and Core Inference.

Result: SOTA models show high accuracy (up to 92%) but low reasoning scores (<45%), indicating correct answers often stem from flawed logic.

Conclusion: AURA highlights the need for robust multimodal evaluation, addressing reasoning gaps in current models.

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper compares Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis, evaluating performance using metrics like SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS. It introduces a modified Gaussian Splatting repository for novel view synthesis and demonstrates its potential to enhance photogrammetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, and to explore how Gaussian Splatting can improve photogrammetry.

Method: Created a dataset of real-world images, built 3D models using both techniques, and evaluated them using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and resolution metrics. Enhanced Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis and augmented the dataset for further photogrammetry analysis.

Result: Gaussian Splatting effectively generates high-quality novel views and can enhance photogrammetry-based reconstructions. Both methods have distinct strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the comparative performance of Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting, highlighting their potential for applications in XR, photogrammetry, and autonomous vehicle simulations.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in multilingual and multimodal document retrieval benchmarks, which currently focus on English-only or single-page QA tasks.

Method: Introduces VisR-Bench with 35K QA pairs across 1.2K documents in 16 languages, featuring diverse question types and queries without explicit answers.

Result: MLLMs outperform text-based and multimodal encoders but struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages.

Conclusion: VisR-Bench highlights challenges in multilingual visual retrieval and provides a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on,
interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and
delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models
(VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark
state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference
video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research
in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated,
rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across
models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level
coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating

TL;DR: An improved segmentation model for herbicide research automates species and damage identification, outperforming traditional methods and showing robustness under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual visual assessments in herbicide research are time-consuming and subjective, prompting the need for automated, efficient, and consistent solutions.

Method: The model combines a self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical taxonomy, trained on multi-year, multi-location data and tested across devices and domains.

Result: The model significantly improved species and damage classification metrics (F1-score and R-squared) and maintained performance under domain shifts, unlike earlier models.

Conclusion: The model's robustness and real-world applicability are confirmed, leading to its deployment in BASF's phenotyping pipeline for large-scale automated monitoring.

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

*Xiaotong Ji,Ryoma Bise,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach enhances top-rank learning in medical image processing by integrating a rejection module to handle noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, improving diagnosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis in medical image processing is critical, but noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances hinder top-rank learning.

Method: Proposes a rejection module cooptimized with top-rank loss to identify and mitigate outliers using a rejection function.

Result: Experimental validation shows the method effectively detects and mitigates outliers, enhancing diagnosis reliability.

Conclusion: The integration of a rejection module improves top-rank learning, making medical image diagnoses more accurate and reliable.

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

### [118] [Enhanced Generative Structure Prior for Chinese Text Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07537)
*Xiaoming Li,Wangmeng Zuo,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-quality text image super-resolution framework for Chinese characters using a novel structure prior within StyleGAN, ensuring precise stroke restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on English text, neglecting complex scripts like Chinese. This paper addresses the challenge of restoring low-resolution Chinese characters with diverse fonts and layouts.

Method: Proposes a structure prior integrated into StyleGAN, using a codebook for character structure and StyleGAN's vector $w$ for style. This ensures accurate stroke restoration.

Result: The framework successfully restores degraded Chinese characters, even with irregular layouts, by leveraging the structure prior and StyleGAN's generative capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust, character-specific guidance for text image super-resolution, outperforming prior approaches for Chinese text.

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

TL;DR: The paper discusses the MIDI-B Challenge for evaluating DICOM image de-identification methods, highlighting the importance of privacy compliance and data utility. The authors' algorithm achieved 99.92% accuracy, ranking 2nd in the challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective de-identification of medical images (DICOM format) to comply with privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, DICOM PS3.15) while preserving data utility for research and clinical use.

Method: Applied pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text replacement, and text removal to de-identify DICOM images.

Result: The algorithm achieved 99.92% accuracy in required actions, ranking 2nd out of 10 teams in the MIDI-B Challenge.

Conclusion: The study underscores the effectiveness of the proposed methods but also identifies limitations, suggesting areas for future improvement in medical image de-identification.

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a domain generalization method for pathological images by leveraging intra-hospital domain shifts using contrastive learning at WSI and patch levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses domain shifts within whole slide images (WSIs) caused by patient characteristics and tissue thickness, avoiding reliance on multi-hospital data.

Method: Clusters WSI-level features from non-tumor regions as domains and applies two-stage contrastive learning (WSI-level and patch-level) to reduce feature gaps.

Result: Effectively minimizes domain shifts by leveraging intra-hospital data.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical solution for domain generalization in pathological images without requiring multi-hospital data.

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Pose, a framework using chain-of-thought reasoning to generate 3D human poses from abstract prompts, addressing the gap between high-level language and detailed pose descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-pose models require low-level prompts, while humans use abstract language, creating a mismatch for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating CoT reasoning to interpret abstract prompts into 3D poses and a data synthesis pipeline for training.

Result: CoT-Pose effectively generates plausible and semantically aligned poses from abstract inputs.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes high-level understanding in pose generation and suggests reasoning-enhanced approaches as a promising direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

TL;DR: The paper extends MatchVoice for soccer commentary generation using the GOAL dataset, evaluating training setups and window sizes, and suggests integrating broader video-language techniques for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of fine-grained alignment between video content and commentary in automated soccer commentary generation motivates this work.

Method: Extends MatchVoice with the GOAL dataset, conducts experiments on training configurations, hardware limitations, and window sizes.

Result: MatchVoice shows promising generalization, but performance can be enhanced with techniques from broader video-language domains.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of MatchVoice while advocating for further integration of video-language methods to improve commentary generation.

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: To improve medical image segmentation by leveraging PU learning for better pseudo-label selection.

Method: Uses Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU learning) to discriminate foreground and background regions on unlabeled images.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in selecting pseudo-labels for various background regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method for medical image
segmentation that can perform learning on ``individual images'' to select
effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU
learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary
classification problems, to obtain the appropriate metric for discriminating
foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning
makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

*Ludan Zhang,Sihan Wang,Yuqi Dai,Shuofei Qiao,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an independent evaluation method (FMCS) for feature maps in autonomous driving models, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of explicit supervision for intermediate modules in end-to-end autonomous driving models, which limits interpretability and module evaluation.

Method: Introduces Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS) and a Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) for unified evaluation. Develops CLIP-FMQE-Net for real-time feature map quality analysis.

Result: Experiments on NuScenes dataset show a 3.89% gain in NDS for 3D object detection, validating improved feature representation.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances feature map quality and overall model performance in autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

*Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Hyunseung Choo,Duc Thanh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE framework improves VLMs' robustness to distribution shifts by dynamically updating a cache of high-confidence embeddings with adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs degrade under distribution shifts; existing TTA methods struggle with unreliable confidence metrics and rigid boundaries.

Method: ACE uses dynamic, class-specific thresholds and iterative refinement to build a robust cache of embeddings.

Result: ACE outperforms existing TTA methods on 15 benchmarks, showing superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: ACE effectively addresses TTA challenges, enhancing VLMs' adaptability to diverse visual distributions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper explores LayerNorm shifts in Vision Transformers (ViTs) during fine-tuning, proposing a rescaling mechanism and cyclic framework to improve performance under data scarcity and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LayerNorm fine-tuning dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts is underexplored, especially its role in transitions between source and target domains.

Method: Proposes a rescaling mechanism using a scalar λ negatively correlated to Fine-tuning Shift Ratio (FSR) and a cyclic framework to align LayerNorm shifts with ideal conditions.

Result: Experiments show OOD tasks yield lower FSR and higher λ, indicating under-represented data. Pathological data behaves like ID settings, favoring conservative updates.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LayerNorm dynamics in transfer learning and practical strategies for fine-tuning, validated across diverse settings.

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD models are computationally expensive, limiting their use in real-world applications, especially on edge devices. GAPNet addresses this by optimizing feature utilization and reducing computational overhead.

Method: GAPNet employs granularity-aware supervision for multi-scale decoder outputs, granularity-aware connections, granular pyramid convolution (GPC), cross-scale attention (CSA), and a self-attention module for global information.

Result: GAPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD models for both images and videos.

Conclusion: GAPNet offers an efficient, lightweight solution for SOD, balancing computational cost and accuracy, making it suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in existing deepfake detection systems, which limits their practical use in critical sectors.

Method: A three-component framework: deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM, visual captioning module, and narrative refinement using an LLM.

Result: Achieves competitive detection performance on DF40 benchmark while providing high-quality, aligned explanations.

Conclusion: DF-P2E advances trustworthy AI by unifying prediction and explanation, making deepfake detection more transparent and accessible.

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

*Jian Ma,Xujie Zhu,Zihao Pan,Qirong Peng,Xu Guo,Chen Chen,Haonan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces X2Edit Dataset for diverse image editing tasks and a plug-and-play module (MoE-LoRA) for seamless integration with generative models, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality open-source datasets and compatible editing modules for community-prevalent generative models.

Method: Constructing a 3.7M high-quality dataset using expert models and VLM-designed instructions, and developing task-aware MoE-LoRA training with contrastive learning.

Result: The model shows competitive editing performance, and the dataset outperforms existing open-source datasets.

Conclusion: X2Edit provides a robust solution for image editing, with open-source resources available for community use.

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

### [134] [An Iterative Reconstruction Method for Dental Cone-Beam Computed Tomography with a Truncated Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07618)
*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage method using Implicit Neural Representation (INR) and iterative reconstruction reduces truncation artifacts in dental CBCT, improving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small detectors in dental CBCT cause truncated FOV, degrading image quality in iterative reconstruction due to accumulated discrepancies.

Method: 1. Use INR to generate a prior image covering an extended FOV. 2. Correct projections with this prior and perform iterative reconstruction.

Result: The two-stage approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, enhancing CBCT image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method mitigates truncation artifacts in dental CBCT, offering a practical solution for compact systems.

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

*Yunsung Chung,Chanho Lim,Ghassan Bidaoui,Christian Massad,Nassir Marrouche,Jihun Hamm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFA is a deep-learning framework that simulates and optimizes atrial fibrillation ablation to predict recurrence risk and improve procedural outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability in catheter ablation outcomes for atrial fibrillation (AF) and the challenge of evaluating efficacy due to complex tissue-procedure interactions motivate the need for predictive and optimization tools.

Method: SOFA uses a multi-modal, multi-view generator to simulate post-ablation scar formation from pre-ablation LGE-MRI and procedural parameters, predicts AF recurrence risk, and optimizes ablation parameters to minimize risk.

Result: SOFA accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and reduces model-predicted recurrence risk by 22.18%.

Conclusion: SOFA is the first framework integrating simulation, prediction, and optimization for personalized AF ablation, offering a novel tool to improve procedural outcomes.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based post-processing pipeline using GNNs leverages spatial relationships to correct object detection anomalies, improving mAP@50 by up to 4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art object detectors often miss spatial consistency in static environments, leading to errors in cluttered or occluded scenes.

Method: Proposes a GNN-based pipeline to model spatial relationships, correcting invalid class labels using neighborhood context.

Result: Significant improvement in detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.

Conclusion: Spatial reasoning enhances reliability in object detection, especially in structured environments.

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

*Junxiao Xue,Xiaozhen Liu,Jie Wang,Xuecheng Wu,Bin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TER, a trusted emotion recognition method using uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions, outperforming others in accuracy and trusted performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on performance but lack reliability for noisy or out-of-distribution data.

Method: TER uses uncertainty estimation to calculate prediction confidence, combining multimodal results based on confidence. Introduces trusted precision, recall, Acc., and F1 score for evaluation.

Result: TER achieves 82.40% Acc. on Music-video and superior trusted F1 scores (0.7511 on IEMOCAP, 0.9035 on Music-video).

Conclusion: TER enhances reliability and robustness, validated by state-of-the-art performance and trusted metrics.

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511
and 0.9035, respectively.

### [138] [AR-VRM: Imitating Human Motions for Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07626)
*Dejie Yang,Zijing Zhao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-VRM improves visual robot manipulation by explicitly imitating human actions from hand keypoints, outperforming prior methods in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual robot manipulation (VRM) rely on costly multi-modal data or web data mismatched with robotic tasks, limiting generalization. This paper addresses the gap by leveraging human action videos explicitly.

Method: Proposes AR-VRM, which uses a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) to learn human action knowledge from hand keypoints. It retrieves similar human action videos for robotic imitation and learns an Analogical Reasoning (AR) map between human and robot actions.

Result: AR-VRM achieves leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark and excels in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating superior generalization.

Conclusion: Explicit imitation of human actions via keypoints enhances VRM performance, especially under data scarcity, validating the AR-VRM approach.

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

### [139] [LaRender: Training-Free Occlusion Control in Image Generation via Latent Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07647)
*Xiaohang Zhan,Dingming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for precise occlusion control in image generation using volume rendering principles in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precision in controlling occlusion relationships between objects in generated images, relying on prompts or layouts without explicit occlusion handling.

Method: Leverages volume rendering principles in a pre-trained diffusion model's latent space to render scenes guided by occlusion relationships and object transmittance, without retraining.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in occlusion accuracy and enables effects like transparency, density, and light intensity adjustments.

Conclusion: The physics-grounded approach provides accurate occlusion control and versatile effects without model retraining.

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

### [140] [Collaborative Learning of Scattering and Deep Features for SAR Target Recognition with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07656)
*Yimin Fu,Zhunga Liu,Dongxiu Guo,Longfei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CLSDF for SAR ATR with noisy labels by integrating scattering and deep features, using GMMs for label division and semi-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled SAR data is hard to acquire due to expert knowledge requirements, leading to noisy labels and degraded ATR performance. Existing methods focus on image data, which is insufficient for SAR.

Method: CLSDF integrates scattering and deep features, models loss distribution with GMMs to divide clean/noisy labels, and uses semi-supervised learning with joint distribution alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MSTAR dataset under various label noise conditions.

Conclusion: CLSDF effectively addresses noisy label challenges in SAR ATR by leveraging multi-feature fusion and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UR-VTON is a training-free framework for virtual try-on, addressing long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions by decomposing the task into undressing and redressing steps, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions due to inaccurate skin restoration, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: UR-VTON uses an undress-to-redress mechanism, Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling, and Structural Refiner to improve skin restoration and detail fidelity.

Result: UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detail preservation and image quality, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: UR-VTON provides a robust solution for challenging VTON scenarios, with potential for seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Chaohong Guo,Xun Mo,Yongwei Nie,Xuemiao Xu,Chao Xu,Fei Yu,Chengjiang Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAR-TVG introduces timestamp anchors to supervise reasoning in TVG, ensuring progressive accuracy in temporal predictions via a three-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods lack explicit constraints on reasoning quality for TVG.

Method: Proposes TAR-TVG with timestamp anchors and a self-distillation training strategy (GRPO, SFT, GRPO).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with interpretable reasoning chains.

Conclusion: TAR-TVG improves TVG by enforcing explicit reasoning supervision and progressive accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

TL;DR: A tuning-free, plug-and-play method for aligning edited 3D assets with original geometry using a geometry preservation module and injection switcher.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in 3D editing tools that preserve geometry while enhancing color, style, and lighting, avoiding quality degradation from 2D editing methods.

Method: Proposes a geometry preservation module using original input normal latents and an injection switcher to control supervision, ensuring alignment between edited and original views.

Result: Improves multi-view consistency and mesh quality across various multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively preserves geometry while enhancing 3D asset edits, offering a practical solution for personalized 3D content generation.

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting method to address biases in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by unifying geometric depth and aligning 3D normals, improving reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in 3DGS arise when Gaussian normal vectors align within single-view projection planes, causing inconsistencies in nearby views. The goal is to enhance multi-view scene reconstruction.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Multi-view distance reprojection regularization for Gaussian alignment via distance loss, and 2) Multi-view normal enhancement for consistency via normal matching.

Result: Outperforms baseline in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, significantly improving surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses multi-view challenges in 3DGS, achieving high-accuracy reconstruction for small indoor and outdoor scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fine-grained multi-class door detection datasets for applications like building compliance and indoor scene understanding, given the scarcity of such datasets.

Method: Uses a deep object detector to identify doors as a unified category, then an LLM for classification based on visual/contextual features, followed by human-in-the-loop validation.

Result: Produces a high-quality dataset with minimal manual effort, suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex domains.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in image segmentation due to occlusions, obscurities, or noise by leveraging star-shape priors.

Method: Combines level set representation with registration framework, imposes constraints on deformed level set function, and uses alternating direction method of multipliers.

Result: Demonstrates accurate star-shape segmentation in synthetic and real images, accommodating single or multiple centers and specified landmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles star-shape segmentation, even in challenging conditions, with practical applications in image analysis.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Motivation: Addressing noisy images in generative data augmentation due to uncontrollable generation and natural language ambiguity, which limits model performance in applications like medical diagnosis.

Method: Developed TriReWeight, a triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method, theoretically analyzed three supervision types for generated images, and integrated it with generative augmentation methods.

Result: Outperformed SOTA methods by 7.9% on natural datasets and 3.4% on medical datasets, with theoretical generalization approaching optimal.

Conclusion: TriReWeight effectively enhances generative data augmentation, is universally applicable, and improves model performance without downgrading existing methods.

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

*Junhyuk So,Juncheol Shin,Hyunho Kook,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD) accelerates autoregressive image models by 3.7x without additional training, leveraging token redundancy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models have slow inference due to sequential generation; existing speculative decoding methods are either slow or require training.

Method: GSD evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens dynamically, avoiding the limitations of single-token speculative decoding.

Result: GSD achieves a 3.7x speedup on average while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: GSD is an effective, training-free method to accelerate autoregressive image models by leveraging token diversity.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

*Minseo Kim,Minchan Kwon,Dongyeun Lee,Yunho Jeon,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Inversion is a novel method for extracting common concepts from small image sets without relying on external guidance, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for techniques to extract common concepts from small image sets without manual guidance, as existing methods degrade quality due to incomplete feature separation.

Method: Uses contrastive learning to train target and auxiliary text tokens, followed by disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning for concept fidelity.

Result: Achieves balanced, high-level performance in concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion effectively identifies and represents common concepts without additional guidance, enhancing generation quality.

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

*Haoran Wang,Zekun Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAV-SAM adapts SAM2 for downstream tasks by treating reference-target pairs as pseudo videos, improving segmentation performance by over 5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reference segmentation methods rely on costly meta-learning; CAV-SAM offers a lightweight alternative.

Method: Represents reference-target pairs as pseudo videos, using DBST for semantic transformation and TTGA for geometric alignment.

Result: Achieves over 5% improvement in segmentation performance compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: CAV-SAM provides an efficient and effective way to adapt SAM2 for downstream tasks without extensive meta-training.

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniSVG, a dataset for AI-driven SVG understanding and generation, leveraging MLLMs to address challenges in precision and multi-modal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven SVG understanding and generation is challenging due to high precision requirements and diverse conditional constraints, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: Proposes UniSVG, a 525k-item dataset for training and evaluating MLLMs in SVG tasks, enabling unified generation and understanding.

Result: Training on UniSVG improves MLLM performance, outperforming SOTA models like GPT-4V in SVG tasks.

Conclusion: UniSVG unlocks MLLM potential for SVG tasks, providing a comprehensive solution for SVG understanding and generation.

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

TL;DR: Dream4D introduces a novel framework combining controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction to create spatiotemporally coherent 4D content, outperforming existing methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with maintaining view consistency and handling complex dynamics in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements.

Method: Dream4D uses a two-stage architecture: predicting optimal camera trajectories from a single image via few-shot learning, then generating multi-view sequences with a pose-conditioned diffusion process, and converting them into a persistent 4D representation.

Result: The framework leverages temporal priors and geometric awareness, achieving higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Dream4D successfully bridges the gap in 4D content synthesis by integrating video generation and reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

### [153] [Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning for Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07771)
*Lei Wang,Shiming Chen,Guo-Sen Xie,Ziming Hong,Chaojian Yu,Qinmu Peng,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLZSL, a framework for Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) that addresses noisy supervision in semantic prototypes through prototype-guided curriculum learning and dynamic prototype updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSL methods rely on manually defined semantic prototypes, which can introduce noise due to instance-level mismatches and class-level imprecision, hindering effective knowledge transfer.

Method: CLZSL uses a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module to prioritize well-aligned samples and a Prototype Update (PUP) module to dynamically refine class-level prototypes.

Result: Experiments on AWA2, SUN, and CUB datasets demonstrate improved visual-semantic mapping and knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: CLZSL effectively mitigates noise in semantic prototypes, enhancing ZSL performance by addressing both instance-level and class-level issues.

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method for robust $SO(3)$ extrapolation of rotational dynamics using Neural Controlled Differential Equations and $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths, addressing challenges like unknown inertia and non-conservative forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in $SO(3)$ extrapolation include unknown dynamics, non-conservative forces, and noisy observations, limiting existing methods reliant on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions.

Method: Leverages Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths to model trajectories in a physically meaningful way, agnostic to energy conservation.

Result: Achieves robust extrapolation in complex, non-inertial systems, generalizing well to unknown physical parameters and noisy inputs.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, integrable into existing pipelines, and effective in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

*Saihui Hou,Chenye Wang,Wenpeng Lang,Zhengxiang Lan,Yongzhen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a snippet-based approach for gait recognition, addressing limitations of set-based and sequence-based methods by incorporating multi-scale temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Set-based methods ignore short-range temporal context, while sequence-based methods fail to capture long-range dependencies. The paper aims to overcome these issues by modeling gait as individualized actions (snippets).

Method: The approach involves Snippet Sampling (randomly selecting frames from segments) and Snippet Modeling (learning multi-scale temporal context). A 2D convolution-based backbone is used.

Result: Achieves rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW, demonstrating the effectiveness of the snippet-based method.

Conclusion: The snippet-based approach enhances gait recognition by leveraging multi-scale temporal context, showing promise for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

*Hongrui Zheng,Yuezun Li,Liejun Wang,Yunfeng Diao,Zhiqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF) to counter deepfake threats by distorting forged content and disrupting attackers' retraining pipelines, ensuring long-term defense effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake defenses lack persistence as attackers can bypass them by retraining models on protected samples.

Method: TSDF uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to distort forged content and poison data sources, blocking attackers' model adaptation.

Result: TSDF demonstrates strong dual defense capability, outperforming traditional methods under adversarial retraining.

Conclusion: TSDF enhances the persistence of active defense against deepfakes by preventing attackers from adapting to defensive perturbations.

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of power batteries is inefficient and error-prone, and traditional vision algorithms struggle with dense plates and imaging artifacts.

Method: Developed PBD5K benchmark with 5,000 X-ray images and an intelligent annotation pipeline. Proposed MDCNeXt, a model integrating multi-dimensional clues (point, line, count) and state space modules for better segmentation.

Result: MDCNeXt improves discrimination between plates and suppresses visual interference, addressing challenges in PBD.

Conclusion: The work advances power battery quality inspection with a scalable benchmark and effective model, promoting further research in this area.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

TL;DR: MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator, improves downstream task performance by adapting fused images to models trained on visible images, leveraging text, masks, and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models trained on visible images perform poorly with multimodal fused images due to pixel distribution differences, degrading downstream task performance.

Method: MambaTrans uses multimodal large language model descriptions and semantic segmentation masks as input, combining cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module to enhance visual capabilities.

Result: Experiments show MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks without adjusting pre-trained model parameters.

Conclusion: MambaTrans successfully bridges the gap between multimodal fused images and models trained on visible images, enhancing downstream task performance.

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: Pose-RFT is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for 3D human pose generation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), addressing ambiguity and alignment issues via hybrid action reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for 3D pose generation struggle with ambiguity and task-specific alignment due to supervised objectives like SMPL parameter regression.

Method: Proposes Pose-RFT, using HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm for joint optimization of discrete language prediction and continuous pose generation, with task-specific rewards.

Result: Pose-RFT outperforms existing pose-specific MLLMs on multiple benchmarks, showing improved spatial and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Hybrid action reinforcement fine-tuning is effective for accurate 3D pose generation in MLLMs.

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTVR is a zero-shot video restoration framework using a diffusion transformer with trajectory-aware attention and a wavelet-guided sampler, achieving state-of-the-art results with superior temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression methods produce unrealistic details and need paired datasets, while generative diffusion models struggle with temporal consistency.

Method: DiTVR combines a diffusion transformer with trajectory-aware attention and a flow-consistent sampler, aligning tokens along optical flow trajectories and injecting data consistency into low-frequency bands.

Result: DiTVR sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art on benchmarks, excelling in temporal consistency, detail preservation, and robustness to flow noise/occlusions.

Conclusion: DiTVR effectively addresses video restoration challenges, outperforming existing methods without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

*Jingze Gai,Changchun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method (S2M2-SAR) for SAR-optical image matching reduces reliance on labeled data by leveraging pseudo-labeling and cross-modal feature enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for SAR-optical image matching is time-consuming and complex, limiting labeled data availability.

Method: Uses pseudo-labeling of unlabeled data and a cross-modal feature enhancement module with unsupervised loss for feature disentanglement.

Result: Outperforms semi-supervised methods and rivals fully supervised SOTA methods.

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR is efficient and practical, reducing dependency on labeled data while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RSFIQA, a fine-grained NR-IQA model that integrates region-level distortion information using SAM and MLLM, enhanced by a Region-Aware Semantic Attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-IQA methods lack sensitivity to local quality variations or fail to focus on semantically salient regions.

Method: Uses SAM for dynamic image partitioning, MLLM for distortion perception, and RSA for aggregating regional features.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RSFIQA is robust, effective, and adaptable to various architectures.

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Architectural Co-Design framework to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), addressing limitations in dense prediction and feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with ZSAD due to lack of local inductive biases and inflexible feature fusion, necessitating a solution for better adaptation.

Method: Proposes Conv-LoRA for fine-grained representation and Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) for adaptive cross-modal fusion.

Result: Shows superior accuracy and robustness on industrial and medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The co-design framework effectively adapts VLMs to dense perception tasks like ZSAD.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

TL;DR: MIMIC framework visualizes internal representations of Vision Language Models (VLMs) by synthesizing visual concepts, improving interpretability and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are complex and hard to interpret, limiting transparency. MIMIC aims to address this by visualizing internal encodings.

Method: MIMIC uses joint VLM-based inversion and feature alignment, with regularizers for spatial alignment, smoothness, and semantic realism.

Result: Evaluated on varying-length texts, MIMIC shows strong visual quality and semantic metrics.

Conclusion: MIMIC is the first model inversion approach for visual interpretation of VLM concepts, enhancing transparency.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores annotation-free adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology using domain-relevant image-caption pairs, improving zero-shot and few-shot performance without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs like CONCH and QuiltNet may underperform in specific histopathology tasks. Supervised fine-tuning requires manual labels, which is costly. The study aims to adapt VLMs without annotations.

Method: The approach involves continued pretraining of VLMs on domain- and task-relevant image-caption pairs from existing databases.

Result: Experiments show improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, matching few-shot methods with larger training sizes while avoiding manual labeling.

Conclusion: Annotation-free continued pretraining is effective, task-agnostic, and a promising method for adapting VLMs to histopathology tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: A novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, CBDES MoE, improves BEV perception for autonomous driving by dynamically selecting expert paths, outperforming single-expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal BEV methods face issues like limited adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization.

Method: Proposes CBDES MoE, a hierarchically decoupled MoE architecture with a Self-Attention Router for dynamic expert selection and efficient inference.

Result: CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point mAP and 4.1-point NDS improvement over the best single-expert model on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: CBDES MoE is effective and practical, advancing BEV perception in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: Deep SWM, a deep state space model with a sparse masked autoencoder, improves solar flare prediction by handling long-range spatio-temporal dependencies and outperforms baselines and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar flare prediction is vital for infrastructure protection, but existing methods lack representation learning or struggle with temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes Deep SWM, using multiple deep state space models and a sparse masked autoencoder with a two-phase masking strategy for pretraining.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods and human experts in performance and reliability, validated on FlareBench.

Conclusion: Deep SWM advances solar flare prediction by addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Ge surface microstructures using graph embeddings and PCA, finding irradiation angle more impactful than fluence on morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ion beam irradiation parameters (angle and fluence) affect the morphological properties of Ge surfaces.

Method: Processed electron microscopy images into skeleton graphs, embedded them using a graph convolutional network, and analyzed embeddings with PCA and Davies-Bouldin index.

Result: Irradiation angle has a more significant impact on Ge surface morphology than fluence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of irradiation angle in controlling Ge surface properties, offering insights for material engineering.

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge
surfaces by ion beam irradiation were processed to extract topological features
as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional
network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component
analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated
using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in
irradiation angle have a more significant impact on the morphological
properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

TL;DR: A novel method for markerless 3D tissue tracking in minimally invasive surgery using 2D TAP networks, combining temporal tracking and stereo matching for accurate motion estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like dynamic tissue motion and limited field of view in surgery to improve guidance, safety, and robotic assistance.

Method: Leverages two CoTracker models (temporal tracking and stereo matching) to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images.

Result: Achieved Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at 10 mm/s velocity on chicken tissue phantom.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of TAP-based models for accurate, markerless 3D tracking in surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Being-M0.5, a real-time, controllable vision-language-motion model (VLMM) addressing key limitations in human motion generation, leveraging the large-scale HuMo100M dataset and a novel part-aware residual quantization technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMMs lack controllability in human motion generation, with issues like poor response to commands, limited pose initialization, and insufficient fine-grained control. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The authors use the HuMo100M dataset (5M motion sequences, 100M instructional instances) and introduce a part-aware residual quantization technique for motion tokenization, enabling precise control over body parts.

Result: Being-M0.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse motion benchmarks and demonstrates real-time capabilities.

Conclusion: The work advances motion generation technology, with HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 poised to accelerate real-world adoption.

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

### [171] [CATP: Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning for Efficient and Enhanced Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07871)
*Yanshu Li,Jianjiang Yang,Zhennan Shen,Ligong Han,Haoyan Xu,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATP is a training-free pruning method for multimodal ICL, reducing image token redundancy while improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods overlook multimodal ICL, causing inefficiency and unstable performance due to redundant tokens.

Method: CATP uses progressive pruning in two stages to handle cross-modal interactions, removing 77.8% of image tokens.

Result: CATP improves performance by 0.6% and reduces inference latency by 10.78% on average.

Conclusion: CATP enhances multimodal ICL efficiency and performance, paving the way for future interleaved image-text applications.

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

### [172] [Selective Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07877)
*WonJun Moon,Hyun Seok Seong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for weakly supervised affordance grounding (WSAG) using selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives to improve part and object-level affordance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSAG methods rely heavily on classification, often focusing on irrelevant patterns, limiting accurate affordance grounding.

Method: The approach leverages CLIP to identify action-associated objects in egocentric and exocentric images, then cross-references these to pinpoint part-level affordance cues using selective objectives.

Result: The method effectively shifts activation from irrelevant areas to meaningful affordance cues, demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: The proposed selective learning strategy enhances affordance grounding by focusing on relevant cues, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework using task-aware enhanced prompts to handle various adverse weather degradations with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dedicated modules for each degradation type, causing parameter overhead and overlooking inter-task relatedness.

Method: Two-stage training: pretraining for general restoration knowledge, then prompt-tuning with task-aware enhanced prompts using low-rank decomposition and contrastive constraints.

Result: Achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters, validated by t-SNE analysis.

Conclusion: The framework improves parameter efficiency and task modeling accuracy for multi-task image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven surgical automation methods require large labeled datasets, which are scarce. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Proposes a dynamic Gaussian model for surgical scenes, dynamic training adjustment for camera pose issues, and automatic annotation generation. Evaluated on a new dataset with 14,000 frames.

Result: Achieves highest PSNR (29.87) for synthetic images. Models trained on synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art augmentation by 10%, improving overall performance by 15%.

Conclusion: The method effectively generates high-quality synthetic surgical datasets, enhancing model training and performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identity-preserving video generation are resource-heavy and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools.

Method: Introduces a conditional image branch and restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, requiring only 2000 training pairs.

Result: Achieves high video quality and identity preservation with ~1% additional parameters, outperforming full-parameter methods.

Conclusion: Stand-In is efficient, versatile, and compatible with various tasks like subject-driven video generation and face swapping.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Motivation: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents is challenging due to variability, degraded sources, and annotation errors like hyphenation.

Method: A self-training method based on CTC alignment algorithm, using dynamic programming and model output probabilities trained with CTC loss.

Result: Performance improved (e.g., 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia), and alignment accuracy increased. Weaker models yielded more accurate alignments.

Conclusion: The approach can be iteratively applied to enhance CER and alignment quality. A corrected dataset subset, code, and benchmarks were released.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

*Yongtao Ge,Kangyang Xie,Guangkai Xu,Mingyu Liu,Li Ke,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses video matting limitations by proposing large-scale pre-training with synthetic data and a novel video matting approach leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for better generalization and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting suffers from poor generalization due to lack of high-quality ground-truth data and reliance on imperfect annotations.

Method: Uses synthetic and pseudo-labeled datasets for pre-training and introduces a video matting approach with diffusion model priors for temporal consistency.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks and strong generalization in real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the synthetic-real domain gap and ensures temporal consistency, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

*Xudong Cai,Shuo Wang,Peng Wang,Yongcai Wang,Zhaoxin Fan,Wanting Li,Tianbao Zhang,Jianrong Tao,Yeying Jin,Deying Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mem4D is a novel framework for dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video, addressing the Memory Demand Dilemma by decoupling static and dynamic modeling with dual-memory architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of balancing long-term stability for static structures and high-fidelity detail retention for dynamic motion in memory-based reconstruction methods.

Method: Proposes Mem4D with a dual-memory architecture: Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM) for dynamic motion and Persistent Structure Memory (PSM) for static geometry.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining global consistency for static elements and high fidelity for dynamic content.

Conclusion: Mem4D effectively resolves the Memory Demand Dilemma, offering efficient and accurate reconstruction for dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSVLM-QA, a large-scale VQA dataset for remote sensing, addressing limitations in existing datasets through rich annotations and diverse questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS VQA datasets lack annotation richness, question diversity, and reasoning assessment, necessitating a more comprehensive dataset.

Method: RSVLM-QA integrates data from multiple RS datasets, uses GPT-4.1 for automated annotation generation, and includes a specialized process for object counting.

Result: The dataset contains 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, outperforming existing benchmarks in depth and breadth.

Conclusion: RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates VLMs in RS and is expected to advance research in RS VQA and VLM fields.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis

necessitates robust mechanisms to detect and manage unexpected or erroneous
model behavior. We introduce development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly
detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems.
Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays
from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation
dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

*Jin-Seop Lee,SungJoon Lee,Jaehan Ahn,YunSeok Choi,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAG, a zero-shot video temporal grounding method that addresses semantic fragmentation and skewed similarity distributions without relying on LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot VTG methods suffer from semantic fragmentation, skewed similarity distributions, and reliance on expensive LLMs.

Method: TAG uses temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and similarity adjustment to capture temporal context and correct similarity distributions.

Result: TAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets without training or LLMs.

Conclusion: TAG is a simple yet effective solution for zero-shot VTG, outperforming existing methods while avoiding computational costs of LLMs.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

TL;DR: VOIDFace introduces a privacy-preserving facial recognition framework using visual secret sharing and patch-based multi-training to eliminate data replication and enhance user control over personal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy and ethical concerns in facial recognition by reducing data replication and improving user control over personal face data.

Method: Uses visual secret sharing for secure data storage and a patch-based multi-training network for robust, privacy-preserving facial recognition.

Result: Experimental results on VGGFace2 show VOIDFace ensures Right-To-Be-Forgotten, data control, security, and privacy while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: VOIDFace successfully improves privacy, security, and efficiency in facial recognition training while empowering users with data control.

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Motivation: To improve patient outcomes by providing intelligent, personalized support to surgical teams through consistent tracking of staff members during long procedures.

Method: TrackOR leverages 3D geometric signatures for online tracking and offline recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: TrackOR improves association accuracy by 11% over baselines and enables staff-centric analyses for personalized systems.

Conclusion: TrackOR makes persistent identity tracking feasible, paving the way for granular analyses and actionable insights to enhance surgical team efficiency and safety.

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Effects is a unified framework for generating prompt-guided and spatially controllable composite visual effects (VFX), overcoming limitations of current methods with innovations like LoRA-MoE and SAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods are limited to single effects due to per-effect LoRA training, hindering spatially controllable composite effects.

Method: Proposes Omni-Effects with LoRA-MoE for diverse effect integration and SAP for spatial control, plus an IIF module to isolate control signals.

Result: Achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Omni-Effects enables users to specify effect categories and locations, advancing VFX production.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

### [185] [The Escalator Problem: Identifying Implicit Motion Blindness in AI for Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07989)
*Xiantao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights a critical flaw in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) called 'Implicit Motion Blindness,' exemplified by the 'Escalator Problem,' where models fail to perceive motion direction. It calls for a shift toward robust physical perception and human-centered benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trustworthiness of MLLMs for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community by identifying and analyzing a critical failure mode in perceiving motion.

Method: Introduces the 'Escalator Problem' as a case study of 'Implicit Motion Blindness,' analyzing its root cause in the frame-sampling paradigm.

Result: Identifies a fundamental limitation in current models' ability to perceive continuous motion, impacting real-world reliability.

Conclusion: Advocates for a paradigm shift toward physical perception and human-centered benchmarks to improve safety and user trust.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Chengzheng Yang,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD introduces learnable group prompts and a lightweight transformer to enhance Vision Foundation Models for Group Activity Detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-group scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are pretrained on object-centric data and lack group-aware reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in Group Activity Detection (GAD).

Method: ProGraD uses learnable group prompts to guide VFM attention and a two-layer GroupContext Transformer to infer actor-group associations and collective behavior.

Result: ProGraD surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving gains of 6.5% (Group mAP@1.0) and 8.2% (Group mAP@0.5) in multi-group scenarios with only 10M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: ProGraD effectively bridges the gap in VFMs for GAD, offering interpretable attention maps and superior performance, particularly in complex multi-group settings.

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRA is a search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies, achieving high accuracy and compatibility without extensive search or tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and suboptimal performance of mainstream AutoDA methods, which are either too slow or lack policy adaptation.

Method: SRA uses a heuristic scoring module to evaluate data complexity and applies tailored augmentations per sample, along with an asymmetric augmentation strategy.

Result: Achieves 78.31% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, improves downstream tasks, and works well without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: SRA is a simpler, effective, and practical AutoDA method with broad applicability.

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses spurious correlations in deep neural networks in surgical ORs, proposing 3D point cloud sequences to avoid biases from visual artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks in ORs often rely on misleading visual cues (e.g., footwear, eyewear) due to standardized attire, hindering accurate modeling of personnel traits like skill level.

Method: The study uses gradient-based saliency analysis on OR datasets and introduces 3D point cloud sequences to separate identity-relevant shape/motion from appearance-based biases.

Result: RGB models drop 12% accuracy in realistic clinical settings, while geometric methods maintain performance, showing better capture of biometric features.

Conclusion: Geometric representations (3D point clouds) are more robust for modeling OR personnel, reducing reliance on spurious visual cues.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar-camera fusion methods ignore weather conditions and underutilize language descriptions, despite radar's robustness in adverse weather and advancements in Vision-Language models.

Method: Introduces text-generation and feature fusion techniques, then proposes TRIDE with weather-aware fusion and radar-enhanced text features.

Result: Achieves 12.87% MAE and 9.08% RMSE improvements on nuScenes dataset over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: TRIDE effectively integrates radar, camera, and text features while adapting to weather, enhancing depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos from monocular video models is an underexplored challenge, limiting immersive applications.

Method: The approach warps monocular videos into pre-defined viewpoints using depth, then applies a frame matrix inpainting framework and a dual-update scheme for consistency.

Result: The method significantly improves over previous techniques, validated on videos from models like Sora and Lumiere.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-quality 3D videos without additional training, advancing immersive video synthesis.

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

TL;DR: PrIINeR integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained models into Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for improved MRI reconstruction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated MRI often degrades image quality; INRs struggle at high acceleration due to weak prior constraints.

Method: Combines population-level knowledge with instance-based optimization and enforces dual data consistency.

Result: Outperforms INR-based and learning-based methods, improving structural preservation and reducing aliasing.

Conclusion: PrIINeR bridges deep learning and INRs, offering reliable high-quality MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

TL;DR: The paper systematically studies design choices for visual grounding (VG) in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using LLaVA-1.5, identifies effective paradigms, and improves VG performance by up to 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches for VG lack systematic verification of design choices, prompting a comprehensive study to bridge this gap.

Method: Analyzes visual grounding paradigms and grounding data design in LLaVA-1.5 through ablation studies.

Result: Achieves improvements of +5.6% to +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g datasets over LLaVA-1.5.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and optimizations for MLLMs in VG, enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

*Xiaoxiao Cui,Yiran Li,Kai He,Shanzhi Jiang,Mengli Xue,Wentao Li,Junhong Leng,Zhi Liu,Lizhen Cui,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new structural causal model (SCM) and Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) to improve multi-label classification of medical images by filtering irrelevant features and enhancing class-specific attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-label classification in medical images struggle with interpreting true causes due to attention to irrelevant features, limiting accurate diagnosis and interpretability.

Method: The authors introduce a Gaussian mixture multi-label spatial attention to filter irrelevant information and a contrastive enhancement-based causal intervention to reduce spurious attention and noise.

Result: IBCA outperforms other methods, achieving significant improvements in metrics like CR, OR, and mAP on Endo and MuReD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed IBCA effectively addresses the challenge of learning discriminative class-specific attention, enhancing multi-label classification performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in
mAP for Endo.

*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Junbao Zhuo,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ME-TST and ME-TST+, two state space model-based architectures for micro-expression (ME) analysis, replacing sliding-window classification with video-level regression to better capture temporal dynamics and varying durations. It introduces multi-granularity ROI modeling and a synergy strategy for spotting and recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for ME analysis use fixed window lengths and treat spotting and recognition separately, limiting accuracy and practicality.

Method: Proposes ME-TST and ME-TST+ architectures using temporal state transition mechanisms, multi-granularity ROI modeling, and a slowfast Mamba framework for improved ME analysis.

Result: The methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in ME spotting and recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures address limitations of previous methods and enhance ME analysis by leveraging temporal dynamics and intrinsic task relationships.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

TL;DR: Matrix-3D is a framework for generating explorable 3D worlds from single images or text prompts, using panoramic representations and combining video generation with 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D world generation often produce scenes with limited scope. Matrix-3D aims to overcome this by leveraging panoramic representations for wider coverage.

Method: The framework uses a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model for scene video generation and two reconstruction methods: a feed-forward model for speed and an optimization-based pipeline for accuracy.

Result: Matrix-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video and 3D world generation, supported by the Matrix-Pano dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances 3D world generation by improving scope and quality, with potential applications in spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

TL;DR: A multimodal network (MDD-Net) using acoustic and visual data from social media detects depression more effectively than current methods, achieving a 17.37% higher F1-Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression severely impacts mental health, and social media data offers a simple yet rich source for detection.

Method: MDD-Net uses mutual transformers to extract and fuse acoustic and visual features from social media, with four modules: feature extraction, mutual transformer, and detection.

Result: The system outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 17.37% in F1-Score on the D-Vlog dataset.

Conclusion: MDD-Net is a highly effective multimodal approach for depression detection, leveraging social media data.

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Ge Jin,Wenzhan Song,Tianming Liu,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for 3D root skeleton extraction from images is introduced, enabling precise modeling of plant root systems for automated breeding robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant roots' complex 3D architecture is hard to capture, and 2D studies are insufficient for understanding root traits. 3D modeling is crucial for botany and breeding.

Method: The method involves detecting and matching lateral roots, triangulating their skeletal structure, and integrating them with primary roots.

Result: The extracted 3D skeletons closely matched ground truth, proving the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach enhances automated breeding by improving root trait analysis, boosting efficiency, and reducing manual work in agriculture.

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

TL;DR: TBAC-UniImage integrates a Diffusion Model with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for deeper multimodal understanding and generation, avoiding shallow connections and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of previous diffusion-based unified models, which either had shallow connections or were computationally expensive.

Method: Uses representations from multiple MLLM layers as generative conditions for the diffusion model, treating it as a 'ladder' for guidance.

Result: Achieves deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.

Conclusion: TBAC-UniImage presents a novel, efficient paradigm for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision
agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and
security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual
features for advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making. Persistent
challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the
complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,
and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing,
reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support
transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward
scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor
miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing MOT challenges like occlusions and depth ambiguity in monocular videos, which conventional TBD methods struggle with due to lack of geometric awareness.

Method: Combines monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation to generate 3D point clouds, uses voxel-based 3D IoU for association, and incorporates depth-aware noise compensation and motion direction consistency in 3D.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks, improving tracking in occluded and complex motion scenarios.

Conclusion: GRASPTrack effectively enhances MOT robustness by leveraging 3D geometric reasoning and adaptive depth-aware techniques.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, mask-free framework called Follow-Your-Shape is proposed for precise object shape editing while preserving non-target content, using a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) and Scheduled KV Injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based image editing models struggle with large-scale shape transformations, often altering non-target regions or failing to achieve desired edits.

Method: The method computes a TDM to locate editable regions and uses Scheduled KV Injection for stable editing. A new benchmark, ReShapeBench, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: The framework achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, especially in large-scale shape replacement tasks.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape offers a robust solution for precise and controllable shape editing without degrading background quality.

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

TL;DR: FantasyStyle is a 3DGS-based style transfer framework using diffusion model distillation to address multi-view inconsistency and VGG feature reliance, achieving superior stylization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based style transfer methods suffer from multi-view inconsistency and reliance on VGG features, leading to style conflicts, content leakage, and excessive stylization.

Method: FantasyStyle introduces Multi-View Frequency Consistency for cross-view consistency and Controllable Stylized Distillation with negative guidance to optimize 3D Gaussians.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, delivering higher stylization quality and visual realism across diverse scenes and styles.

Conclusion: FantasyStyle effectively addresses key challenges in 3DGS-based style transfer, offering improved consistency and control over stylization.

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

TL;DR: The paper proposes TUNA, a method integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), addressing incorrect module selection and overlooked shared knowledge in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods using pre-trained models often freeze the network and use lightweight modules, leading to performance issues due to incorrect module selection and lack of shared knowledge.

Method: TUNA trains task-specific adapters for crucial features and uses an entropy-based selection mechanism. It also employs adapter fusion to create a universal adapter for shared discriminative features, combining both for inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show TUNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TUNA effectively combines task-specific and universal adapters to improve CIL performance by leveraging both specialized and general knowledge.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

TL;DR: ReconDreamer-RL integrates video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to enhance autonomous driving training, reducing the sim2real gap and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the sim2real gap in autonomous driving simulations by improving scene reconstruction and generating corner-case scenarios.

Method: Uses ReconSimulator (video diffusion + kinematic modeling) and introduces Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA) and Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) for diverse training.

Result: Outperforms imitation learning with a 5x reduction in Collision Ratio.

Conclusion: ReconDreamer-RL effectively bridges the sim2real gap and enhances end-to-end autonomous driving training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

TL;DR: CD-TVD combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based super-resolution to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution with limited high-resolution data, reducing reliance on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale simulations require costly high-resolution data; existing super-resolution methods need extensive HR training data, limiting their versatility.

Method: Uses contrastive learning and an improved diffusion model with local attention, pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned with minimal new HR data.

Result: Achieves accurate and efficient 3D super-resolution on fluid and atmospheric simulations, reducing HR data dependency.

Conclusion: CD-TVD advances data augmentation for scientific simulations by minimizing HR data needs while preserving detail recovery.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

### [207] [MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177)
*Zhonghao Yan,Muxi Diao,Yuxuan Yang,Jiayuan Xu,Kaizhou Zhang,Ruoyan Jing,Lele Yang,Yanxi Liu,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel task combining clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding, and presents MedReasoner, a modular framework using reinforcement learning for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical-grounding pipelines rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, which fail to handle implicit queries common in clinical practice.

Method: The authors propose MedReasoner, a framework separating reasoning (optimized with reinforcement learning) from segmentation (using a frozen expert). They also release U-MRG-14K, a dataset with 14K samples for evaluation.

Result: MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and generalizes well to unseen clinical queries.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

### [208] [3D Human Mesh Estimation from Single View RGBD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08178)
*Ozhan Suat,Bedirhan Uguz,Batuhan Karagoz,Muhammed Can Keles,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M³ (Masked Mesh Modeling), a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGBD view, leveraging synthetic data from MoCap datasets to overcome data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGBD cameras are underutilized in 3D human mesh estimation due to the lack of large, diverse datasets. The paper aims to address this by using synthetic data from MoCap datasets.

Method: The method involves creating partial, single-view meshes from MoCap data, training a masked autoencoder to complete these meshes, and matching sensor depth values to a template mesh during inference.

Result: M³ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm PVE on SURREAL and CAPE datasets, outperforming methods using full-body point clouds. It also outperforms an RGB-based method by 18.4 mm on BEHAVE.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of M³ in leveraging depth data for accurate 3D human mesh estimation, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

### [209] [PP-Motion: Physical-Perceptual Fidelity Evaluation for Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08179)
*Sihan Zhao,Zixuan Wang,Tianyu Luan,Jia Jia,Wentao Zhu,Jiebo Luo,Junsong Yuan,Nan Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PP-Motion, a novel metric for evaluating human motion fidelity by combining physical alignment and human perception, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion fidelity evaluation methods suffer from gaps between human perception and physical feasibility, and lack fine-grained, objective ground truth.

Method: A physical labeling method calculates minimal modifications for motion alignment with physical laws, producing continuous annotations. PP-Motion uses Pearson's correlation loss for physical priors and perceptual fidelity loss for human alignment.

Result: PP-Motion aligns better with physical laws and human perception than previous methods, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: PP-Motion provides a robust, data-driven metric for evaluating motion fidelity by integrating physical and perceptual aspects.

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

### [210] [THAT: Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer for Hyperspectral Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08183)
*Hongkun Jin,Hongcheng Jiang,Zejun Zhang,Yuan Zhang,Jia Fu,Tingfeng Li,Kai Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transformer-based framework (THAT) for hyperspectral pansharpening, addressing limitations like redundant tokens and lack of multi-scale features by introducing token selection and high-frequency detail enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer methods for hyperspectral pansharpening struggle with redundant token representations and poor high-frequency feature preservation, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed THAT framework includes Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) for token prioritization and a Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) for high-frequency detail learning.

Result: Experiments show THAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: THAT effectively addresses key challenges in hyperspectral pansharpening, offering improved performance and practical utility.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

TL;DR: KARMA is an efficient semantic segmentation framework for structural defects, using fewer parameters and maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and class imbalance in civil infrastructure inspection.

Method: Introduces KARMA with TiKAN modules, optimized feature pyramids, and a static-dynamic prototype mechanism for efficient defect segmentation.

Result: Achieves competitive mean IoU with 97% fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M) and operates at 0.264 GFLOPS for real-time use.

Conclusion: KARMA enables practical, accurate automated infrastructure inspection systems with high efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a coherent overview of the rapidly evolving field of visual RL, organizing works into themes and identifying future research directions.

Method: The survey formalizes visual RL problems, traces policy-optimization evolution, categorizes 200+ works into four pillars, and reviews evaluation protocols.

Result: Identifies trends like curriculum-driven training and unified reward modeling, while highlighting challenges such as sample efficiency and safe deployment.

Conclusion: Offers a structured map of visual RL, aiding researchers and practitioners, with resources available for further exploration.

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

*Peiqi He,Zhenhao Zhang,Yixiang Zhang,Xiongjun Zhao,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial-ORMLLM is a large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial modeling in ORs rely on multimodal data, which is hard to obtain, and 2D data lacks fine-grained details.

Method: Spatial-ORMLLM uses RGB data and a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block to integrate 2D inputs with 3D knowledge, enabling robust 3D reasoning without extra sensors.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on clinical datasets and generalizes well to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM provides a scalable solution for 3D spatial reasoning in ORs without requiring multimodal data or expert annotations.

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGOnline is a lightweight, zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, addressing computational inefficiency and multi-object tracking limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods face high computational costs, limited spatial reasoning, and inability to track multiple objects simultaneously.

Method: Uses a decoupled strategy with video foundation models for 2D mask propagation and a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation algorithm for Gaussian-level labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (92.7% mIoU on NVOS, 95.2% on Spin-NeRF) and 15--1500x faster inference speed (27 ms/frame).

Conclusion: SAGOnline enables real-time 3D scene understanding, advancing AR/VR and robotics applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

*Wenyi Mo,Ying Ba,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Biye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Large Language Model-based approach with contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to predict personalized user preferences more accurately by distinguishing likes/dislikes and capturing shared interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for user preference prediction often overlook individual variability and dynamic tastes, relying on general preferences or static profiles.

Method: Uses Multimodal Large Language Models, contrastive preference loss, and preference tokens to learn from historical interactions and activate group-specific preferences.

Result: Outperforms other methods in accuracy, identifies users with similar aesthetic inclinations, and provides precise guidance for image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved personalized preference prediction.

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMGSR is a framework for one-step Real-ISR using DDPM/FM models, addressing the gap between LQ image and Gaussian latent distributions by injecting LQ latents at mid-timesteps. It includes refinements and losses to improve performance and eliminate artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between LQ image latent distribution and Gaussian noisy latent distribution limits the use of generative priors in one-step Real-ISR.

Method: OMGSR injects LQ image latent distribution at a mid-timestep, uses Latent Distribution Refinement loss, and Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to reduce artifacts.

Result: OMGSR variants (OMGSR-S/F) achieve balanced/excellent performance at 512-resolution, with OMGSR-F dominating in all metrics. Scaling to 1k/2k-resolution also yields excellent results.

Conclusion: OMGSR effectively bridges the latent distribution gap and enhances one-step Real-ISR performance, demonstrating superiority in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cut2Next introduces Next Shot Generation (NSG) using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to create cinematically coherent shots with professional editing patterns, outperforming current methods in visual consistency and narrative flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on visual consistency but lack narrative sophistication and cinematic integrity, limiting storytelling quality.

Method: Cut2Next employs a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with Hierarchical Multi-Prompting (Relational and Individual Prompts) and architectural innovations (CACI and HAM) to generate shots adhering to editing patterns.

Result: Cut2Next excels in visual consistency, text fidelity, and user preference for cinematic continuity and narrative expressiveness.

Conclusion: Cut2Next successfully bridges the gap between visual coherence and cinematic storytelling, validated by user studies and benchmarks.

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

*Shuyuan Tu,Yueming Pan,Yinming Huang,Xintong Han,Zhen Xing,Qi Dai,Chong Luo,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableAvatar is an end-to-end video diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length, high-quality videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency, addressing limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long video synthesis, audio synchronization, and identity consistency due to reliance on third-party audio embeddings and lack of audio priors in diffusion backbones.

Method: StableAvatar introduces a Time-step-aware Audio Adapter to prevent error accumulation, an Audio Native Guidance Mechanism for better synchronization, and a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy for smoothness.

Result: Experiments show StableAvatar outperforms benchmarks in generating long, high-quality videos with improved audio-video alignment.

Conclusion: StableAvatar effectively addresses the challenges of infinite-length video generation with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency.

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: Advancing embodied AI by enabling segmentation of 3D objects based on natural language, including occluded or indirectly visible objects.

Method: Proposes ReferSplat, a framework modeling 3D Gaussian points with natural language in a spatially aware paradigm.

Result: ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on R3DGS and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel task, dataset, and framework, demonstrating the importance of 3D multi-modal understanding for embodied AI.

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

*Emily Yue-Ting Jia,Jiageng Mao,Zhiyuan Gao,Yajie Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can imagine 4D scenes from still images due to accumulated observations and physics intuition; the paper aims to replicate this in neural networks for natural fluid imagery.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network to predict motion guided by physical principles (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) and animates 3D Gaussians derived from the input image.

Result: Produces physically plausible animations, significantly improving over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between single-image input and physics-consistent 4D scene generation.

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight method combining anatomical knowledge and rule-based topology constraints for automated coronary artery labelling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death, and current methods for coronary artery labelling are inefficient or resource-intensive.

Method: Integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based topology constraints for labelling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising, efficient solution for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant solution for automated brain tumor classification, advancing deep learning in neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized medicine for heterogeneous diseases like MS by predicting lesion progression and treatment effects.

Method: Uses a voxel-space approach with multi-modal data (MRI, treatment info) to forecast future NET2 lesion masks.

Result: Accurately predicts NET2 lesion masks across six treatments and shows potential for clinical applications like lesion count estimation.

Conclusion: Highlights the promise of causal, image-based generative models for MS prognostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in medical imaging but produce hallucinations—confident but incorrect outputs—that can mislead clinical decisions.

Method: The study examines hallucinations in two tasks: image-to-text (generating reports from scans) and text-to-image (creating images from prompts), evaluating errors like factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies using expert criteria.

Result: Common hallucination patterns are identified in both tasks, with implications for clinical reliability, and factors like model architecture and training data are discussed.

Conclusion: The work provides insights for improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM-driven medical imaging systems by systematically studying their errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 3DGS-VBench is introduced as a dataset and benchmark for assessing the quality of compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, addressing the lack of systematic evaluation in existing compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high storage demands of 3DGS and the distortions introduced by compression methods necessitate a standardized quality assessment framework.

Method: The study compiles 660 compressed 3DGS models and videos from 11 scenes using 6 SOTA compression algorithms, annotated by 50 participants for MOS scores.

Result: The dataset validates the reliability of quality assessments and benchmarks 6 compression algorithms and 15 quality metrics.

Conclusion: 3DGS-VBench facilitates specialized VQA model training and advances research in 3DGS compression and quality assessment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high
visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical
deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate
compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques
introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To
this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment
(VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences
generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with
systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50
participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset
reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency
and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple
paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as
a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research. The dataset is

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAGCNet improves MRI slice imputation by modeling inter-slice relationships and leveraging 3D spatial context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical MRI accuracy is hindered by missing or unusable slices, requiring better methods to impute missing data in volumetric MRI.

Method: SAGCNet uses a volumetric slice graph completion module for inter-slice relationships and a spatial adapter for 3D context.

Result: SAGCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing missing CMR slices, even with limited data.

Conclusion: SAGCNet effectively addresses challenges in volumetric MRI slice imputation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of MRI sequence heterogeneity in deep learning models, which limits clinical utility due to poor generalization across varying acquisition parameters.

Method: PRISM uses a novel pretraining paradigm to disentangle anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations, trained on 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets.

Result: PRISM achieved first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream tasks, showing significant improvements in generalization across diverse MRI protocols.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances AI's translational potential in radiology by providing a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, ensuring consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ST resolution is limited, and existing methods face challenges in feature extraction, multimodal alignment, and gene-specific variation.

Method: HaDM-ST uses a semantic distillation network, spatial alignment module, and channel-aware adversarial learner to enhance resolution.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on 200 genes across diverse tissues, improving spatial fidelity and gene-level coherence.

Conclusion: HaDM-ST effectively addresses key challenges in high-resolution ST generation, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and
gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

TL;DR: DiffVC-OSD is a one-step diffusion-based neural video compression framework that improves perceptual quality and speed over multi-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance perceptual quality and reduce computational complexity in video compression by simplifying the diffusion process to a single step.

Method: Uses a one-step diffusion model guided by temporal context and latent representation, with a Temporal Context Adapter and End-to-End Finetuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression, 20× faster decoding, and 86.92% bitrate reduction compared to multi-step variants.

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD is an efficient and high-quality solution for neural video compression.

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

TL;DR: ALDEN is a deep learning-based method for LDCT denoising that integrates anatomical semantics using pretrained vision models, adversarial learning, and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDCT denoising methods often ignore anatomical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. ALDEN addresses this by incorporating tissue-specific features.

Method: ALDEN combines hierarchical semantic features from NDCT via cross-attention and uses contrastive learning to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: ALDEN outperforms previous methods, reducing noise while preserving anatomical details and minimizing over-smoothing.

Conclusion: ALDEN effectively integrates anatomical awareness into LDCT denoising, validated by superior performance and downstream segmentation tasks.

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Motivation: Early, accurate diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is crucial for patient survival, and AI-human collaboration can enhance precision and efficiency in detection.

Method: A HITL system uses EfficientNetV2S for initial diagnosis, followed by human expert review and correction of misclassified images, iteratively refining the model.

Result: The system achieves 93.65% accuracy, with further improvements from human feedback, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration enhances IDC detection accuracy, offering a promising approach for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Result: Produces clinically realistic synthetic images, validated by expert evaluation, and improves diagnostic accuracy in classification tasks.

Conclusion: The framework advances equitable AI in gynaecology by providing a privacy-safe synthetic dataset and robust models for reproducible research.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative MRI synthesis by embedding physical MRI sequence parameters into the model.

Method: A physics-driven neural network embeds TR, TE, and TI parameters, using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images to synthesize T1, T2, and PD maps.

Result: Achieved high performance (PSNR >34 dB, SSIM >0.92) and accurately synthesized maps for unseen pathological regions.

Conclusion: The method enhances qMRI reliability and clinical utility by leveraging physical principles of MRI signals.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence

values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise
morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders.
Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive
AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a
self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses
an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and
is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse
acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification.
Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor
classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and
generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model
tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations
for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance.
RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing
nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable
diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are
available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can
