### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V2-VLNCE, a generalized scenario for Vision-Language Navigation (VLNCE) with varied viewpoints, and proposes VIL, a view-invariant post-training strategy to enhance navigation policy robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, limiting their practical applicability. The paper aims to address this by improving robustness to variations in camera height and viewing angle.

Method: VIL uses a contrastive learning framework for view-invariant features and a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module. It employs end-to-end training to optimize components jointly.

Result: VIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 8-15% in Success Rate on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets. It also achieves SOTA performance on RxR-CE and maintains standard viewpoint performance.

Conclusion: VIL is an effective plug-and-play post-training method that enhances robustness to viewpoint changes without compromising standard performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel ML technique detects deepfake videos by analyzing unnatural facial biometric patterns, tested across diverse datasets and unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake videos are increasingly used for fraud and disinformation, necessitating reliable detection methods.

Method: The technique leverages unnatural facial biometric patterns to identify deepfake impersonations.

Result: Evaluated on a large dataset, the method shows reliability against video laundering and generalizes to unseen deepfake generators.

Conclusion: The proposed forensic ML technique effectively detects deepfake videos, addressing current challenges in fraud and disinformation.

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a data-free, task-agnostic method for mitigating bias in vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. It uses an LLM to generate biased scene descriptions and a novel contrastive debiasing loss to reduce spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often inherit and amplify biases from training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM aims to debias VLMs without predefined bias categories or external data.

Method: PRISM operates in two stages: (1) an LLM generates biased scene descriptions from simple class prompts, and (2) a contrastive-style debiasing loss learns a projection to minimize spurious correlations while preserving image-text alignment.

Result: PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on Waterbirds and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively reduces bias in VLMs without external data, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMR-ViT combines temporal and kinematic data for human mesh recovery, outperforming methods using only one type of information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods use either temporal or kinematic data, but not both, limiting accuracy.

Method: HMR-ViT constructs a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image using a Channel Rearranging Matrix and processes it with Vision Transformer for SMPL parameter regression.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets.

Conclusion: HMR-ViT effectively integrates temporal and kinematic information, improving HMR accuracy.

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining NeRF and MPM to estimate granular material properties from visual data, achieving accurate friction angle estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer material properties like friction angle from visual observations when direct measurement is impractical.

Method: Uses NeRF for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images, initializes MPM simulation, and optimizes friction angle via Bayesian optimization by comparing simulated and observed images.

Result: Friction angle estimated with an error within 2 degrees, proving the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework is a viable solution for characterizing granular materials in scenarios lacking direct measurement options.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a visual analytics framework designed to improve the quality of multi-modal foundation model-generated labels, addressing gaps in existing methods by integrating multi-phased validation and human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches prioritize data quantity over quality in auto-labeling, lacking comprehensive validation methods for FM-generated labels.

Method: VISTA combines multi-phased data validation strategies with human expertise to identify and correct issues in FM-generated labels.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through use cases on benchmark datasets and expert reviews, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

Conclusion: VISTA enhances data quality for multi-modal models, particularly in open-vocabulary image segmentation, by leveraging human validation and comprehensive analysis.

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two contrastive loss functions to improve diversity in tail class images for class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, without affecting head class performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing mode collapse and reduced diversity in tail class images due to imbalanced training data in class-conditional diffusion models.

Method: Two contrastive loss functions: (1) unsupervised InfoNCE loss to increase dissimilarity among synthetic images, and (2) MSE loss contrasting conditional and unconditional generation at large timesteps.

Result: The framework outperforms standard DDPM and other methods on datasets like CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.

Conclusion: The proposed contrastive learning approach effectively enhances tail class diversity in imbalanced datasets for diffusion models.

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

### [9] [Infinite Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09068)
*Dell Zhang,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Mengxi Jia,Changzhi Sun,Ruilong Ren,Jingren Liu,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Infinite Video Understanding' as a next frontier for AI, addressing challenges in processing long-duration videos and suggesting key research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with computational and memory constraints for long videos, and maintaining temporal coherence and fine-grained details remains challenging.

Method: The paper suggests innovations like streaming architectures, persistent memory, hierarchical representations, and event-centric reasoning.

Result: The idea of Infinite Video Understanding is presented as a transformative goal for multimedia and AI research.

Conclusion: Framing Infinite Video Understanding as a research objective can drive innovation in video processing and reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight reduces FLOPs in VLMs by 32%-41% with minimal accuracy impact by leveraging sparse attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision data increases prompt length and prefill duration in VLMs due to quadratic attention complexity. Sparse attention patterns can mitigate this bottleneck.

Method: Analyze attention patterns in VLMs, categorize sparse patterns (sink-only, document mask, hybrid), and propose BlindSight, a training-free method using input template-aware sparsity masks.

Result: BlindSight reduces FLOPs by 32%-41% with -2%-+2% accuracy change in multi-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: BlindSight effectively optimizes VLM inference by exploiting sparse attention patterns without training.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

### [11] [From Physics to Foundation Models: A Review of AI-Driven Quantitative Remote Sensing Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09081)
*Zhenyu Yu,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Hua Wang,Pei Wang,Junyi Chen,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews the evolution of remote sensing inversion methods from physics-based models to AI-driven approaches, focusing on foundation models, and discusses challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the shift from traditional physics-based methods to data-driven and foundation model-based approaches in remote sensing inversion.

Method: Reviews and compares physical models (e.g., PROSPECT), machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning), and foundation models (e.g., SatMAE), highlighting their assumptions, applications, and limitations.

Result: Identifies advancements in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and cross-task adaptation, but notes challenges like interpretability and domain generalization.

Conclusion: Envisions next-generation foundation models with unified modeling, cross-domain generalization, and improved physical interpretability.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

### [12] [Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082)
*Seungwoo Kim,Khai Loong Aw,Klemen Kotar,Cristobal Eyzaguirre,Wanhee Lee,Yunong Liu,Jared Watrous,Stefan Stojanov,Juan Carlos Niebles,Jiajun Wu,Daniel L. K. Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores zero-shot optical flow extraction from frozen self-supervised video models using counterfactual prompting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large pre-trained video models for optical flow extraction without fine-tuning, addressing the scarcity of labeled data and sim-to-real gaps.

Method: Extends the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm to generative video models, proposing KL-tracing for flow extraction by injecting perturbations and measuring predictive divergence.

Result: Achieves 16.6% and 4.7% relative improvements on real-world and synthetic datasets, respectively, without flow-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Counterfactual prompting of generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised methods for high-quality flow extraction.

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MI CAM, a post-hoc visual explanation method for CNNs, using mutual information to weigh feature maps for saliency visualizations, validated by counterfactual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of CNN mechanisms and provide unbiased, causal interpretations for model inferences.

Method: MI CAM weighs feature maps by their mutual information with the input image, combining them linearly for saliency visualizations.

Result: MI CAM matches state-of-the-art methods and outperforms some in qualitative and quantitative measures.

Conclusion: MI CAM offers effective visual performance and unbiased explanations for CNN inferences, validated by counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

*Yunsoo Kim,Jinge Wu,Honghan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo integrates radiologists' eye-gaze videos into LVLMs, improving CXR analysis performance by up to 24.6% in report generation and 15.2% in disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the sequential order of radiologists' eye movements, which could provide valuable insights for CXR analysis.

Method: Proposes RadEyeVideo, which uses eye-gaze videos to capture temporal and spatial dynamics, evaluated with three LVLMs.

Result: Performance improved significantly, with RadEyeVideo enabling a general-domain LVLM to outperform specialized medical models.

Conclusion: Integrating expert knowledge (eye-gaze) with LVLMs enhances clinical task performance, advancing human-centered medical analytics.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

### [15] [Harnessing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Point Cloud Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09102)
*Yiyang Chen,Shanshan Zhao,Lunhao Duan,Changxing Ding,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSD leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) for 3D self-supervised learning by aligning 3D point clouds with SD features, improving performance despite limited 3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of 3D diffusion models trained on small datasets by utilizing the robust capabilities of large-scale text-to-image SD models.

Method: Replace SD's text encoder with a 3D encoder, train a point-to-image diffusion model, and align 3D backbone features with SD features.

Result: PointSD enhances 3D self-supervised learning, validated by downstream tasks and ablation studies.

Conclusion: SD models can effectively improve 3D representation learning, with PointSD providing a practical framework.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

### [16] [Hybrid Autoregressive-Diffusion Model for Real-Time Streaming Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09105)
*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models for Sign Language Production (SLP) improves generation quality and real-time efficiency by leveraging sequential dependency modeling and output refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of autoregressive methods (error accumulation) and diffusion models (iterative nature) in SLP by combining their strengths.

Method: Hybrid autoregressive-diffusion model, Multi-Scale Pose Representation for fine-grained movements, and Confidence-Aware Causal Attention for dynamic pose generation.

Result: Effective on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets, showing improved generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully balances quality and efficiency, advancing SLP for real-time applications.

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

*Di Wen,Kunyu Peng,Kailun Yang,Yufan Chen,Ruiping Liu,Junwei Zheng,Alina Roitberg,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoHOI, the first robustness benchmark for HOI detection, addressing model degradation in real-world conditions. It proposes SAMPL, a learning strategy to enhance robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI detection models fail under real-world corruptions like environmental variability, occlusion, and noise, limiting their practical utility.

Method: The authors create RoHOI, a benchmark with 20 corruption types, and propose SAMPL, a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning strategy, to dynamically optimize models for robustness.

Result: Experiments show SAMPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving model resilience to corruptions.

Conclusion: The work sets a new standard for robust HOI detection, with benchmarks and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

*Linlan Huang,Xusheng Cao,Haori Lu,Yifan Meng,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MG-CLIP, a method leveraging the modality gap in CLIP for continual learning, improving performance without extra replay data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works overlook the modality gap in CLIP, which is crucial for its generalization. The paper aims to analyze and utilize this gap for continual learning.

Method: MG-CLIP preserves and compensates the modality gap to mitigate forgetting and enhance new data capacity.

Result: Extensive experiments show MG-CLIP outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The modality gap is key for continual learning, and MG-CLIP offers a simple, effective solution.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

*Chuan Guo,Inwoo Hwang,Jian Wang,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SnapMoGen introduces a large-scale text-motion dataset with detailed annotations and proposes MoMask++, a model for high-quality motion generation from text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion methods lack fine-grained controllability and generalization due to dataset limitations.

Method: SnapMoGen provides a dataset with 20K motion clips and 122K detailed descriptions. MoMask++ uses multi-scale token sequences and a generative masked transformer.

Result: MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and handles casual user prompts via LLM reformatting.

Conclusion: SnapMoGen and MoMask++ advance text-to-motion generation with improved datasets and models.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

*Dewen Zhang,Tahir Hussain,Wangpeng An,Hayaru Shouno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseLLM introduces a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector to improve spatial-textual interactions in pose estimation, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP on COCO and maintaining zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pose estimation methods struggle with novel poses or unseen keypoints. Language-guided approaches like LocLLM lack complex spatial-textual interactions, limiting precision.

Method: PoseLLM replaces LocLLM's linear projector with a lightweight two-layer MLP with GELU activation for hierarchical cross-modal feature fusion.

Result: PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on COCO validation, +0.4 AP over LocLLM, and strong zero-shot performance on Human-Art and MPII.

Conclusion: A nonlinear connector in PoseLLM enhances localization accuracy without compromising generalization, advancing language-guided pose estimation.

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

### [21] [$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144)
*Zhimin Liao,Ping Wei,Ruijie Zhang,Shuaijia Chen,Haoxuan Wang,Ziyang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $I^{2}$-World is an efficient 4D occupancy forecasting framework for 3D scenes, using dual tokenizers and an encoder-decoder architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes for autonomous driving systems to handle corner cases.

Method: Decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene (multi-scale residual quantization) and inter-scene (residual aggregation) tokenizers, with an encoder-decoder architecture for high-level control and temporal consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by 25.1% in mIoU and 36.9% in IoU, with low memory usage (2.9 GB) and real-time inference (37.0 FPS).

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World is a highly efficient and effective solution for 4D occupancy forecasting in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Score Distillation (SSD) improves text-guided image and 3D editing by enhancing stability, alignment, and editing strength through a streamlined framework anchored to the source prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Delta Denoising Score face challenges in stability, spatial control, and editing strength due to complex auxiliary structures, leading to conflicting signals and imprecise edits.

Method: SSD uses Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) for cross-prompt alignment and introduces a null-text branch for stability. It also includes a prompt enhancement branch for stronger style edits.

Result: SSD achieves state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D editing tasks, including NeRF and style edits, with faster convergence and reduced complexity.

Conclusion: SSD provides a robust, efficient solution for text-guided editing, ensuring coherence and precise modifications while maintaining structural integrity.

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

TL;DR: A vision transformer-based backbone fuses RGB and depth data for better generalization, using contrastive learning and curriculum learning for sim2real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth information is robust to scene variations and provides 3D details, enhancing generalization in vision tasks.

Method: Separate CNN stems process RGB and depth data, fused by a vision transformer. Contrastive learning with masked tokens improves sample efficiency, and curriculum learning aids sim2real transfer.

Result: The method effectively combines RGB and depth modalities, improving generalization and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances generalization and sim2real transfer by fusing RGB-depth data and using advanced learning schemes.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores prompt pool methods in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL), identifies performance degradation due to token-dimension saturation, and proposes LGSP-Prompt, a spatial prompting method, to improve results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL struggles with data scarcity and incremental learning. Prompt pool methods, effective in traditional settings, are untested in FSCIL, prompting this study.

Method: The paper introduces LGSP-Prompt, which shifts prompt learning to the spatial dimension by combining local and global features for dynamic prompt selection.

Result: LGSP-Prompt outperforms existing methods in FSCIL benchmarks, excelling in knowledge preservation and incremental learning.

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt addresses token-dimension saturation in FSCIL, achieving state-of-the-art performance through spatial prompting.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) caused by misaligned multimodal features, specifically due to long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE). It introduces MCA-LLaVA, a solution using Manhattan distance to improve spatial alignment and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs stem from misaligned multimodal features, exacerbated by RoPE's long-term decay, which biases perception toward certain image regions.

Method: Proposes MCA-LLaVA, extending RoPE's decay to two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay using Manhattan distance to align image tokens better.

Result: MCA-LLaVA improves multimodal alignment, reducing hallucinations and performing well on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA effectively mitigates image alignment bias, enhancing LVLM performance and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video scene graph generation lack fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dependencies, leading to fragmented representations.

Method: THYME combines hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to model multi-scale spatial context and enforce temporal consistency.

Result: THYME outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 datasets, improving scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Conclusion: THYME addresses limitations in dynamic scene graph generation, offering more accurate and coherent results, validated by a novel dataset (AeroEye-v1.0).

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: Wave propagation on the surface of a material contains information about

measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health
monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further

TL;DR: Expert-CFG aligns MedVLM with clinical expertise without extra training, using expert-in-the-loop guidance and uncertainty estimation to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MedVLMs produce uncertain or incorrect responses, risking medical applications. Training-dependent fixes are costly and lack clinical alignment.

Method: Proposes Expert-CFG: estimates uncertainty, retrieves references for expert input, and refines token embeddings using classifier-free guidance.

Result: Outperforms 13B-parameter models on medical VQA benchmarks with only 4.2B parameters and minimal expert input.

Conclusion: Expert-CFG is feasible for clinical use in resource-limited settings, improving accuracy without costly training.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes S3AD, a stereo-based 3D anomaly detection algorithm, to improve generalization in detecting rare objects. It introduces KITTI-AR, a synthetic dataset with 97 new categories, to address training limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D detection models struggle with rare anomalies due to coupled 2D-3D training and limited sample diversity. Enhancing generalization for arbitrary shapes and anomaly filtering is crucial for autonomous driving.

Method: S3AD decouples 2D and 3D training and uses a foreground confidence-based anomaly scoring algorithm. KITTI-AR, a synthetic dataset, is created to augment training and evaluate zero-shot scenarios.

Result: The proposed method improves generalization for 3D anomaly detection, validated by experiments on the KITTI-AR dataset.

Conclusion: S3AD and KITTI-AR effectively address generalization challenges in 3D anomaly detection, with potential applications in autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

*Jingguo Liu,Han Yu,Shigang Li,Jianfeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spherical sampling method for panoramic images is introduced to leverage pre-trained 2D models, addressing distortion issues and improving performance in tasks like segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained 2D models struggle with panoramic image distortions, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks.

Method: Proposes a spherical sampling method based on pre-trained model weights to mitigate distortions and uses it for panoramic image segmentation.

Result: Achieves favorable initial training values and commendable results on the Stanford2D3D dataset.

Conclusion: The method successfully adapts pre-trained 2D models for panoramic images, enhancing performance in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Track-On, a transformer-based model for online long-term point tracking, achieving state-of-the-art results without future frame access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like streaming video and embodied AI require online point tracking, but existing methods rely on offline settings with future frame access.

Method: Evaluates visual foundation models for spatial features and proposes Track-On, a transformer-based model treating points as queries for sequential frame processing.

Result: Track-On outperforms existing methods on seven benchmarks, proving long-term tracking feasibility without future information.

Conclusion: Track-On demonstrates robust online point tracking by integrating memory for temporal coherence, setting a new standard for the field.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM is a unified framework addressing distribution shift and confidence misalignment in foundation models like CLIP and SAM, improving performance across vision and medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face challenges like distribution shift and confidence misalignment, limiting their deployment. Existing solutions are domain-specific.

Method: StaRFM introduces Fisher information penalty (FIP) for covariate shift and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) for uncertainty calibration, with theoretical PAC-Bayes bounds.

Result: StaRFM improves accuracy (+3.5%), reduces ECE (28%), achieves 84.7% DSC in medical tasks, and lowers cross-domain performance gap by 40%.

Conclusion: StaRFM is a plug-and-play solution for foundation models, offering consistent performance gains with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

*G. Kutay Türkoglu,Julian Tanke,Iheb Belgacem,Lev Markhasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using Stable Diffusion to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric views, improving generalizability and reducing training burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate digital telepresence by addressing challenges like occlusions and distorted proportions in egocentric views.

Method: Uses a generative backbone (Stable Diffusion) to convert top-down egocentric images into realistic frontal views, leveraging ControlNet.

Result: First study to use generative prior for egocentric avatar reconstruction, enabling motion generation from minimal input.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more accessible and generalizable telepresence systems by simplifying avatar creation from egocentric inputs.

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

TL;DR: A novel framework for assessing the artistic painting process is introduced, featuring a dataset (PPAD) and a Transformer-based model (PPJudge) that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on static images, ignoring the dynamic, multi-stage nature of painting processes. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: Introduces PPAD, a large-scale dataset of painting process images, and PPJudge, a Transformer-based model with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts architecture.

Result: PPJudge outperforms baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: The framework provides new insights into computational creativity and art education, addressing a critical gap in artistic image assessment.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

TL;DR: AGCD-Net, a model combining Hybrid ConvNeXt and AG-CIM, addresses context bias in emotion recognition by using causal intervention and attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional emotion recognition methods suffer from context bias, where spurious correlations between background and labels (e.g., "garden" with "happy") reduce accuracy.

Method: Proposes AGCD-Net with Hybrid ConvNeXt (integrating Spatial Transformer and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers) and AG-CIM (causal intervention module) to debias context.

Result: AGCD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAER-S dataset, demonstrating robust emotion recognition.

Conclusion: Causal debiasing is crucial for accurate emotion recognition in complex scenarios, and AGCD-Net provides an effective solution.

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

### [36] [Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256)
*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyuan Ge,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAHR framework improves image-text matching by addressing semantic ambiguities and leveraging high-order relations through dynamic clustering, adaptive aggregation, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with semantic ambiguities and fail to utilize neighborhood relationships, limiting high-order shared knowledge learning.

Method: AAHR uses dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning, global/local feature extraction, adaptive aggregation, and GNN-enhanced semantic interactions.

Result: AAHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: AAHR effectively mitigates ambiguities and enhances semantic understanding, advancing image-text matching performance.

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A segment-aware visual tokenization framework for gloss-free SLT reduces input sequence length by 50%, lowers memory usage, and improves scalability. It introduces token-to-token contrastive alignment and dual-level supervision, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on PHOENIX14T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scalability and computational demands of gloss-free SLT methods, which often rely on complex models.

Method: Proposes segment-aware visual tokenization to convert videos into discrete tokens, reducing sequence length. Introduces token-to-token contrastive alignment and dual-level supervision for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 50% shorter input sequences, 2.67x lower memory usage, and outperforms state-of-the-art on PHOENIX14T.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for gloss-free SLT, validated by superior performance and reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross Knowledge Distillation (CKD) to improve Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using RGB data and ANNs, addressing cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag behind ANNs due to limited annotated event-based datasets and immature architectures. The goal is to enhance SNN performance on DVS data by leveraging RGB data and ANNs.

Method: CKD uses semantic similarity and sliding replacement for cross-modality, and indirect phased knowledge distillation for cross-architecture challenges.

Result: Experiments on N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS show CKD outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods.

Conclusion: CKD effectively bridges the gap between SNNs and ANNs, improving SNN performance on neuromorphic datasets.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

*Anita Kriz,Elizabeth Laura Janes,Xing Shen,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt4Trust is a reinforcement learning framework for prompt augmentation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), improving confidence calibration and accuracy for trustworthy clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs in healthcare face issues with prompt sensitivity and overconfidence, which undermine trust in safety-critical settings.

Method: A lightweight LLM is trained to generate context-aware auxiliary prompts, guiding MLLMs to align confidence with accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art medical VQA performance on PMC-VQA and shows zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs.

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust enhances MLLM trustworthiness in clinical settings through automated, human-aligned prompt engineering.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

### [40] [Generative Latent Kernel Modeling for Blind Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09285)
*Chenhao Ding,Jiangtao Zhang,Zongsheng Yue,Hui Wang,Qian Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for blind motion deblurring (BMD) uses a deep generative model to encode kernel priors and improve initialization, reducing sensitivity to initial blur kernels. It integrates a GAN-based kernel generator and initializer with existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High non-convexity in BMD optimization causes sensitivity to initial blur kernels, limiting deep prior-based methods.

Method: Pre-train a GAN-based kernel generator and initializer to encode kernel priors and provide better initialization. Integrate these with existing BMD methods.

Result: Reduces sensitivity to kernel initialization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses initialization sensitivity in BMD and can be extended to non-uniform motion deblurring without additional priors.

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

*Yuval Grader,Hadar Averbuch-Elor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic-aware floorplan localization framework improves accuracy by jointly estimating depth and semantic rays, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current floorplan localization techniques ignore rich semantic details like window and door locations, focusing only on structural cues.

Method: The framework constructs a structural-semantic probability volume in a coarse-to-fine manner, refining high-probability regions for precise 2D location and orientation predictions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, with significant recall improvements and the ability to incorporate metadata for further gains.

Conclusion: The semantic-aware approach enhances floorplan localization by leveraging detailed semantics, offering superior performance and flexibility.

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High visual similarity in surgical phases and lack of structural cues in RGB images necessitate additional depth information for accurate recognition.

Method: Proposes Geo-RepNet, a geometry-aware framework with Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) and Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention (GEMA) modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a nine-phase ESD dataset, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Depth information significantly enhances surgical phase recognition, with Geo-RepNet proving effective in complex surgical environments.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Result: Outperforms CNN-based methods by up to 3.2% in 5-shot accuracy and shows superior feature separability.

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet is a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot classification, establishing a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

*Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Angular A* (DAA*), a method improving path smoothness and similarity in imitation learning by incorporating Path Angular Freedom (PAF) into A*. It outperforms existing methods in path similarity and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path smoothness is often neglected in path imitation learning, limiting the quality of learned paths. The paper aims to address this by enhancing path similarity and optimality through adaptive smoothness.

Method: DAA* integrates PAF into A* to balance move angles, optimizing path shortening and smoothing. It evaluates path similarity and length across 7 datasets, including mazes, video games, and drone-view scenarios.

Result: DAA* improves path similarity metrics (SPR, ASIM, PSIM) by up to 9.0% over Neural A* and outperforms TransPath by 6.7% in SPR. It also achieves shorter paths when plausible.

Conclusion: DAA* effectively balances path optimality and smoothness, demonstrating superior performance in imitation learning tasks. A minor trade-off with search efficiency is noted.

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models excel in RGB image synthesis but lack exploration in RGBA (transparent/layered) content due to missing benchmarks.

Method: ALPHAVAE extends a pretrained RGB VAE with an alpha channel, trained using a composite objective including alpha-blended reconstruction and dual KL divergence.

Result: ALPHAVAE achieves +4.9 dB PSNR and +3.2% SSIM improvements over LayerDiffuse, enabling superior transparent image generation.

Conclusion: ALPHA and ALPHAVAE advance RGBA image synthesis, offering a benchmark and efficient model for transparent content generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

### [46] [ProactiveBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Evaluating Proactive Interactions in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09313)
*Yueqian Wang,Xiaojun Meng,Yifan Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProactiveBench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating proactive interaction in multimodal dialogue systems, with PAUC as a new metric accounting for temporal dynamics. PAUC aligns better with human preferences than traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for proactive interaction in multimodal dialogue systems, where users expect systems to autonomously determine response timing during tasks like video playback.

Method: Introduces ProactiveBench for benchmarking and PAUC, a metric evaluating temporal dynamics of responses. Benchmarks baseline systems and conducts a user study.

Result: PAUC aligns better with human preferences than traditional metrics, providing a more accurate evaluation of proactive interaction.

Conclusion: PAUC offers a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction scenarios, advancing the field of multimodal dialogue systems.

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

### [47] [Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder for Audio-Visual Fusion in Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09323)
*Kaixuan Cong,Yifan Wang,Rongkun Xue,Yuyang Jiang,Yiming Feng,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICCAE, an encoder for fine-grained audio-video alignment, addressing class confusion through dynamic loss adjustment and a novel training framework. It achieves 65.5% top-1 accuracy on VGGSound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-video pre-training lacks focus on distinguishing similar classes, which humans naturally do. This gap motivates the need for a model that reinforces class distinctions.

Method: Proposes DICCAE, which dynamically adjusts confusion loss based on inter-class confusion. Includes a training framework for audio-video fusion and a cluster-guided self-supervised pre-training strategy.

Result: Achieves 65.5% top-1 accuracy on VGGSound, with ablation studies validating the model's components.

Conclusion: DICCAE effectively enhances class distinction in audio-video tasks, demonstrating strong performance and the importance of its modules.

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

*Wencan Huang,Daizong Liu,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast3D is a plug-and-play framework for pruning redundant visual tokens in 3D MLLMs, improving computational efficiency without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs face computational inefficiency due to excessive object-centric visual tokens, and existing 2D token pruning methods don't apply well to 3D domains.

Method: Fast3D introduces Global Attention Prediction (GAP) for token importance estimation and Sample-Adaptive Pruning (SAP) for dynamic token budgets based on input complexity.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show Fast3D's effectiveness, especially at high pruning ratios.

Conclusion: Fast3D addresses 3D token redundancy efficiently, enabling practical deployment of 3D MLLMs.

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

*Svetlana Orlova,Tommie Kerssies,Brunó B. Englert,Gijs Dubbelman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple Video ViTs with strong pre-training match or surpass complex TAD methods, emphasizing efficiency and scalability. Self-supervised MVM and DAPT are key for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if simple architectures with strong pre-training can outperform complex multi-stage TAD methods.

Method: Uses plain Video ViTs with various pre-training strategies (weakly-, fully-supervised, self-supervised MVM, and DAPT).

Result: Simple encoder-only models with MVM and DAPT outperform specialized TAD methods, showing efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Pre-training is crucial; simple architectures with MVM and DAPT can achieve strong TAD performance without complexity.

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Result: High training accuracy (~90%) but ~60% validation accuracy, indicating minor overfitting. Deployed on a mobile-compatible platform.

Conclusion: The system offers scalable, accessible disease detection and management, enhancing precision agriculture and global food security.

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel system for real-time celestial terrain feature tracking using lightweight neural networks and improved domain adaptation methods, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for celestial terrain feature tracking are computationally heavy, slow, and lack generalization, while emerging learning-based approaches face hardware limitations and data scarcity.

Method: Proposes lightweight neural networks for real-time execution, improved domain adaptation for detection, and attention alignment for robust landmark description.

Result: The unified system achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The work presents an efficient solution for real-time celestial terrain tracking, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modeling individual and interactive movements in multi-person motion prediction often leads to high computational costs.

Method: Lightweight dual branches learn local/global representations separately, with a cross-level interaction block and spatial distance embedding for enhanced modeling.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW datasets with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed model efficiently balances accuracy and computational efficiency for multi-person motion prediction.

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

TL;DR: CKAA improves robustness in Continual Learning by aligning feature subspaces and using adaptive task-confidence-guided inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address feature subspace misalignment in PEFT-based CL methods to reduce ambiguous decisions from misleading task-ids.

Method: Introduces Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA) for feature distribution alignment and Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA) for adaptive inference.

Result: CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods in experiments.

Conclusion: CKAA enhances model robustness against misleading task-ids through innovative alignment and adaptive aggregation techniques.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

TL;DR: HMID-Net integrates Masked Image Modeling and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space for efficient hierarchical visual-semantic learning, outperforming MERU and CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently train models to capture and leverage visual-semantic hierarchies, which are naturally structured in hyperbolic space.

Method: Proposes HMID-Net, combining Masked Image Modeling and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space, with a novel distillation loss function.

Result: Achieves success comparable to Euclidean space methods, excelling in image classification and retrieval, outperforming MERU and CLIP.

Conclusion: HMID-Net is a highly efficient method for hierarchical learning in hyperbolic space, demonstrating superior performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a new benchmark for evaluating deep temporal reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs), requiring full video context understanding, unlike existing superficial frame-level benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks often allow models to answer questions by scanning key frames, lacking assessment of true video understanding. GLIMPSE addresses this gap.

Method: GLIMPSE includes 3,269 videos and 4,342 visual-centric questions across 11 categories, crafted to require full video context and temporal reasoning.

Result: Human accuracy on GLIMPSE is 94.82%, while the best LVLM (GPT-o3) achieves only 66.43%, showing a significant gap in deep video reasoning.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE highlights the limitations of current LVLMs in true video understanding, pushing for advancements beyond surface-level analysis.

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDTN and TRN for hyperspectral image classification, addressing challenges like high-dimensional data and limited labeled samples. The methods improve accuracy and reduce computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and scarce labeled samples, leading to poor performance in hyperspectral image classification.

Method: Proposes SDTN for dynamic tensor rank adjustment and TRN for integrating extracted features into a lightweight network to capture multi-scale spectral-spatial features.

Result: Experiments on PaviaU datasets show improved accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReTA, a reliable test-time adaptation method for vision-language models, addressing entropy unreliability and inflexible decision boundaries with CER and DDC strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks without labeled data, necessitating reliable test-time adaptation methods.

Method: ReTA integrates Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER) for robust cache construction and Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC) for adaptive decision boundaries.

Result: ReTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ReTA enhances reliability in test-time adaptation for VLMs, addressing key challenges in cache-based methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

### [61] [QuarterMap: Efficient Post-Training Token Pruning for Visual State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09514)
*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap is a post-training pruning method for SSM-based models like VMamba, reducing spatial redundancy to improve throughput without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial redundancy in SSM-based vision backbones like VMamba to enhance efficiency without retraining.

Method: Prunes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling.

Result: Achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with <0.9% accuracy drop and similar gains on ADE20K and MedMamba.

Conclusion: QuarterMap is a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency in SSMs, outperforming token merging methods like ToMe.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

### [62] [When Schrödinger Bridge Meets Real-World Image Dehazing with Unpaired Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09524)
*Yunwei Lan,Zhigao Cui,Xin Luo,Chang Liu,Nian Wang,Menglin Zhang,Yanzhao Su,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB is a novel unpaired dehazing framework using Schrödinger Bridge and optimal transport theory for high-quality results, with detail-preserving regularization and prompt learning for haze-aware alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN-based unpaired dehazing methods struggle with limited transport mapping, hindering effectiveness in unpaired training.

Method: Proposes DehazeSB, leveraging Schrödinger Bridge and OT theory for direct distribution bridging, detail-preserving regularization, and prompt learning with CLIP models.

Result: Superior performance on multiple real-world datasets, generating high-quality dehazed images.

Conclusion: DehazeSB effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for unpaired dehazing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

### [63] [VDInstruct: Zero-Shot Key Information Extraction via Content-Aware Vision Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09531)
*Son Nguyen,Giang Nguyen,Hung Dao,Thao Do,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), improves Key Information Extraction (KIE) by separating spatial detection from semantic extraction, using content-aware tokenization to reduce redundancy and achieve SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform poorly on dense documents due to inefficient vision tokenization, leading to redundant computation and memory issues.

Method: VDInstruct employs content-aware tokenization (generating tokens based on document complexity) and a three-stage training paradigm.

Result: Achieves SOTA on KIE benchmarks, reduces image tokens by 3.6x, and outperforms baselines like DocOwl 1.5 by +5.5 F1 in zero-shot evaluations.

Conclusion: Content-aware tokenization and explicit layout modeling enhance document understanding, with VDInstruct demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

*Zihao Xiong,Fei Zhou,Fengyi Wu,Shuai Yuan,Maixia Fu,Zhenming Peng,Jian Yang,Yimian Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRPCA-Net, a deep unfolding network, integrates sparsity-aware priors for infrared small target detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between performance and interpretability in deep learning models for infrared small target detection by leveraging intrinsic sparsity priors.

Method: Proposes Dynamic RPCA Network (DRPCA-Net) with a dynamic unfolding mechanism and Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module for adaptive parameter generation and contextual variation capture.

Result: DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy on multiple public infrared datasets.

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net successfully combines model-based priors with deep learning, enhancing robustness and generalization for infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

*Ximeng Zhai,Bohan Xu,Yaohong Chen,Hao Wang,Kehua Guo,Yimian Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, for detecting closely-spaced infrared small targets (CSIST) in dense groups. It addresses challenges like precise sub-pixel localization and lack of datasets by providing a benchmark dataset (SeqCSIST), a toolkit, and a new model (DeRefNet) with a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment module, achieving a 5.3% mAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in detecting closely-spaced infrared small targets (CSIST) due to optical and detector limitations, which cause them to appear as mixing spots. The lack of high-quality datasets further hinders research progress.

Method: The paper proposes the Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning framework with a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module for adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. It also introduces the SeqCSIST dataset and toolkit for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset show that DeRefNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) by 5.3%.

Conclusion: The work pioneers the CSIST Unmixing task in a multi-frame paradigm, providing a dataset, toolkit, and a novel model (DeRefNet) that significantly advances detection accuracy.

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

### [66] [EHPE: A Segmented Architecture for Enhanced Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09560)
*Bolun Zheng,Xinjie Liu,Qianyu Zhang,Canjin Wang,Fangni Chen,Mingen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a segmented architecture (EHPE) for 3D hand pose estimation, focusing on improving accuracy by addressing error accumulation in distal joints (TIP and wrist).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the importance of TIP and wrist joints, leading to error accumulation and degraded pose estimation quality.

Method: EHPE uses a two-stage approach: (1) TW-stage for TIP and wrist joint extraction, and (2) PG-stage with a dual-branch network to refine remaining joints.

Result: EHPE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed EHPE effectively reduces predictive errors and enhances hand pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

TL;DR: WordCraft is an interactive artistic typography system using diffusion models for localized edits, iterative refinement, and multi-character composition, enhanced by a large language model for prompt interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for artistic typography lack interactivity, localized edits, and flexible prompt interpretation.

Method: WordCraft integrates diffusion models with a training-free regional attention mechanism and noise blending for refinement. A large language model parses user prompts.

Result: The system synthesizes high-quality, stylized typography for single- and multi-character inputs in multiple languages.

Conclusion: WordCraft enhances interactivity and creative possibilities in artistic typography.

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MENTOR is an autoregressive framework for precise multimodal image generation, addressing limitations of current models with a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models lack precise visual control and require extensive training for complex multimodal tasks.

Method: MENTOR uses an autoregressive image generator with a two-stage training paradigm: multimodal alignment and instruction tuning.

Result: MENTOR outperforms baselines in concept preservation, prompt following, and efficiency, despite limited resources.

Conclusion: MENTOR offers improved controllability, fidelity, and adaptability for multimodal image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

TL;DR: MA-SAM2 improves surgical video segmentation by addressing SAM2's limitations with context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models, achieving better performance without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's greedy memory design struggles with surgical videos due to rapid movements, occlusions, and complex interactions, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Method: MA-SAM2 introduces training-free context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models, using multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference for efficiency.

Result: MA-SAM2 outperforms SAM2 by 4.36% and 6.1% on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: MA-SAM2 is a robust, efficient solution for surgical video segmentation, suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and

surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inter2Former optimizes dense-token processing for interactive segmentation, balancing accuracy and speed on CPU devices with adaptive computation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between accuracy (dense-token methods) and speed (SAM) in interactive segmentation by improving dense-token efficiency.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE), Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), and Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU) to optimize computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-precision benchmarks with efficient CPU processing.

Conclusion: Inter2Former successfully balances segmentation quality and computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

TL;DR: FAIR improves fine-grained classification in VLMs by dynamically aligning image and text features using Class Description Anchors, outperforming SOTA methods by 2.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised adaptation in VLMs either lack adaptability or are computationally expensive, limiting their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks.

Method: FAIR introduces Class Description Anchors (CDA) and a Learned Alignment Score (LAS) to dynamically align features and refine pseudo-labels through self-training.

Result: FAIR achieves a 2.78% performance gain over SOTA methods across 13 fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: FAIR's dynamic alignment and self-training refinement significantly enhance fine-grained unsupervised adaptation in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

*Yilin Lu,Jianghang Lin,Linhuang Xie,Kai Zhao,Yansong Qu,Shengchuan Zhang,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAA is a framework for generating realistic anomaly-mask pairs using few-shot learning, addressing issues like low realism and poor mask alignment in anomaly synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly inspection in manufacturing is hindered by scarce anomaly samples and limitations of existing synthesis methods.

Method: GAA uses a pretrained latent diffusion model, localized concept decomposition, adaptive clustering, and region-guided mask generation.

Result: GAA outperforms on MVTec AD and LOCO datasets in anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GAA effectively generates high-quality anomaly-mask pairs, improving anomaly localization and classification.

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

TL;DR: An AI framework using MaxViT for multiclass stroke classification from CT scans achieved 98% accuracy and F1-score, integrating XAI for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate stroke diagnosis is critical for patient outcomes, especially in emergencies. CT scans are widely used, but AI can enhance classification accuracy and trust.

Method: Used MaxViT and other transformer variants for stroke classification, with data augmentation and synthetic image generation to address class imbalance. Integrated XAI (Grad-CAM++) for explainability.

Result: MaxViT with augmentation achieved 98.00% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming other models and baselines.

Conclusion: The study provides a trustworthy, interpretable AI tool for early stroke detection, aiding clinical practice and emergency diagnosis.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI models for diabetic retinopathy (DR) prediction show high performance but exhibit fairness disparities. Disentanglement as a bias mitigation technique yields mixed results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and generalization concerns in AI-based DR diagnosis, ensuring equitable healthcare solutions.

Method: Evaluated three models (ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, Swin V2) on the mBRSET dataset for DR prediction and sensitive attributes (age, gender/sex). Applied disentanglement to mitigate bias.

Result: High DR prediction performance (up to 94% AUROC), but fairness disparities (e.g., 10% AUROC gap in age groups). Disentanglement improved DINOv2 (2% gain) but reduced performance in others.

Conclusion: Fairness in medical imaging AI is complex; disentanglement effectiveness varies by model, highlighting the need for equitable solutions.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

*Zhengyuan Peng,Jianqing Xu,Shen Li,Jiazhen Ji,Yuge Huang,Jingyun Zhang,Jinmin Li,Shouhong Ding,Rizen Guo,Xin Tan,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EyeSeg is an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation framework for AR/VR, addressing motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and domain gaps, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gaze estimation in AR/VR requires robust eye segmentation, but current methods struggle with motion blur, occlusion, and domain gaps.

Method: EyeSeg models segmentation uncertainties using Bayesian learning of a posterior under a closed set prior, providing uncertainty scores and segmentation results.

Result: EyeSeg outperforms existing methods in segmentation metrics (MIoU, E1, F1, ACC) and enhances gaze estimation robustness.

Conclusion: EyeSeg effectively addresses key challenges in eye segmentation, improving performance and reliability for AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: VST-Pose offers a reliable, privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis, with superior performance in pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a

*Osher Rafaeli,Tal Svoray,Ariel Nahlieli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for high-resolution DEM estimation using prompt-based monocular depth estimation, achieving 100x resolution gain and robust generalization across diverse landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution elevation data is crucial for hydrology, urban studies, and ecosystem monitoring, but existing methods like super-resolution and monocular depth estimation have limitations.

Method: Fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs, using low-resolution SRTM data and high-resolution NAIP imagery for tasks like DEM estimation, void filling, and updating.

Result: Achieves a 100x resolution gain (30-m to 30-cm) with <5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Suitable for hydrological and environmental studies.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, high-resolution elevation mapping with broad applications, and all code/models are publicly available.

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExpStar, a model for automatic experiment commentary generation, and ExpInstruct, a dataset for this task, showing superior performance over existing LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human teachers spend significant time preparing experiment commentary, requiring subject expertise. Automating this could save time and enhance learning.

Method: The paper constructs ExpInstruct, a dataset with 7K step-level commentaries, and proposes ExpStar, a retrieval-augmented model for commentary generation.

Result: ExpStar outperforms 14 leading LMMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating insightful experiment commentary.

Conclusion: ExpStar advances AI-assisted scientific instruction, with potential to transform experiment teaching.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

*Phat Nguyen,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys token compression techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs), identifies gaps in current research, and evaluates their effectiveness on standard and compact ViT architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified survey on token compression methods and their limited evaluation on compact ViTs, which are crucial for edge devices.

Method: Presents a systematic taxonomy of token compression approaches (pruning, merging, hybrid) and evaluates them on standard and compact ViT models.

Result: Token compression works well for standard ViTs but often underperforms on compact designs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for adapting token optimization techniques for compact ViTs, especially for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

### [82] [Advancing Text-to-3D Generation with Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09748)
*Yu Lei,Bingde Liu,Qingsong Xie,Haonan Lu,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD) to improve text-to-3D generation by addressing convergence and stability issues in VSD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational Score Distillation (VSD) improves text-to-3D generation but suffers from slow convergence and instability due to mismatched distributions.

Method: The authors propose adjusting the optimization order (lookahead) and linearizing the score model to stabilize training, resulting in $L^2$-VSD.

Result: $L^2$-VSD outperforms prior methods in quality and stability, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The method is effective, scalable, and compatible with existing VSD frameworks.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid geometric-pictorial method for optimal fragment alignment without shape or content assumptions, tested on a new dataset with real-world erosion mimicry, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fragment-reconstruction methods struggle with realistic fragment shapes and rely on restrictive assumptions, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes a hybrid geometric and pictorial approach for fragment alignment, introduces a new dataset with simulated erosion, and evaluates compatibility metrics.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art precision and recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, showing improved compatibility performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively handles diverse fragment shapes and erosion, advancing real-world puzzle-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

*Amirhossein Ansari,Ke Wang,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine improves zero-shot OOD detection by refining negative labels and introducing a dynamic scoring function to address limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing negative label-based methods struggle with misclassifying in-distribution samples as OOD due to subcategory labels and proper nouns, and handling multi-matching images.

Method: NegRefine filters subcategory labels and proper nouns from negative labels and uses a multi-matching-aware scoring function.

Result: NegRefine achieves robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples, validated on benchmarks like ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: NegRefine enhances zero-shot OOD detection by refining negative labels and dynamically adjusting scoring for better performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

*Younggun Kim,Ahmed S. Abdelrahman,Mohamed Abdel-Aty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRU-Accident is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in VRU-vehicle accident scenarios, revealing their limitations in reasoning about accident causes and preventability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs in safety-critical VRU scenarios motivates the creation of VRU-Accident.

Method: VRU-Accident includes 1K dashcam videos with 6K QA pairs and 1K dense descriptions, focusing on VRU-vehicle accidents.

Result: Evaluation of 17 MLLMs shows they struggle with reasoning about accident causes and preventability, despite performing well on visual attributes.

Conclusion: VRU-Accident highlights the need for improved MLLM reasoning in safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

*Shuhao Fu,Philip J. Kellman,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares human and deep learning models' 3D shape recognition, finding that visual transformers (point transformer) better mimic human performance due to hierarchical abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if deep learning models develop 3D shape representations similar to human vision for object recognition.

Method: Human experiments manipulated point density, object orientation, and local geometric structure. Two deep learning models (DGCNN and point transformer) were compared to human performance.

Result: Humans performed consistently well. The point transformer model better accounted for human performance, attributed to its hierarchical abstraction mechanism.

Conclusion: Point transformers more closely resemble human 3D shape recognition, suggesting their representations align better with human vision.

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based

*Yongheng Zhang,Xu Liu,Ruihan Tao,Qiguang Chen,Hao Fei,Wanxiang Che,Libo Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViTCoT, a video reasoning paradigm combining visual and textual modalities, outperforming text-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning relies on text, ignoring visual cues, unlike human reasoning which integrates both.

Method: Developed ViTCoT, a Video-Text Interleaved CoT paradigm, and created the ViTIB benchmark using MLLMs and manual verification.

Result: ViTCoT enhances performance over text-only CoT and activates more neurons in MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViTCoT offers a more intuitive and effective approach to video reasoning by integrating visual and textual information.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 4D human parsing framework is introduced to reduce inference time and enable open-vocabulary capabilities, outperforming prior methods with 93.3% faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human part segmentation methods are limited by closed-set datasets and slow inference, hindering their practicality in dynamic 3D human representation for virtual and extended reality.

Method: The framework uses mask-based video tracking, a Mask Validation module for new targets, and a 4D Mask Fusion module with memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization.

Result: The method achieves significant speed improvements (93.3% faster) and flexibility in 4D human-centric parsing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering faster and more adaptable 4D human parsing.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

*Yiran Qiao,Disheng Liu,Yiren Lu,Yu Yin,Mengnan Du,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CECAS introduces a causally-guided adversarial method for counterfactual visual explanations, improving validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism by avoiding spurious perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual visual explanation methods neglect causal relationships and spurious correlations, leading to low-quality explanations.

Method: CECAS leverages a causally-guided adversarial approach to generate counterfactuals, integrating causal perspectives to avoid unwanted perturbations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, achieving balanced trade-offs in validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Conclusion: CECAS effectively addresses limitations of prior methods by incorporating causal insights, enhancing the quality of counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

*Zhanjiang Yang,Lijun Sun,Jiawei Dong,Xiaoxin An,Yang Liu,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCGA proposes a two-stage method for hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB images, using spectral pattern learning and refined mapping with attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect the challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional (RGB) to high-dimensional (HSI) data, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) multi-scale VQ-VAE learns spectral patterns (Mixture of Codebooks), (2) RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined using prior knowledge and attention mechanisms (Grayscale-Aware and Quantized Self-Attention).

Result: MCGA achieves state-of-the-art performance in hyperspectral reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the RGB-to-HSI challenge with a novel two-stage approach and attention mechanisms, offering lightweight and efficient recovery.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

*Xiuyu Wu,Xinhao Wang,Xiubin Zhu,Lan Yang,Jiyuan Liu,Xingchen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MessDet, a strictly rotation-equivariant detector for aerial images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotation equivariance is crucial for aerial object detection, but existing methods rely on approximations or data augmentation. The study investigates the necessity of strict rotation equivariance.

Method: Implemented a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network, and introduced a multi-branch head to reduce parameters and improve accuracy.

Result: MessDet outperforms on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and DIOR-R datasets with low parameter count.

Conclusion: Strict rotation equivariance enhances aerial object detection, and the multi-branch head design improves efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

*Yadong Qu,Shancheng Fang,Yuxin Wang,Xiaorui Wang,Zhineng Chen,Hongtao Xie,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGD is a method for automated graphic design using natural language instructions, combining parametric rendering and image asset generation for editable, scalable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graphic design methods lack creativity, intelligence, and editability, making automation impractical.

Method: IGD uses a design platform, standardized file format, MLLM for attribute prediction and layout, and a diffusion model for image generation.

Result: IGD achieves superior results, offering scalability and extensibility in complex tasks.

Conclusion: IGD provides a practical, innovative solution for automated graphic design.

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

*Siyue Yao,Mingjie Sun,Eng Gee Lim,Ran Yi,Baojiang Zhong,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Crucial-Diff is a domain-agnostic framework addressing data scarcity by synthesizing crucial samples, improving detection and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in fields like medical and autonomous driving causes overfitting and imbalance, limiting model performance. Existing synthetic samples lack diversity and fail to target model weaknesses.

Method: Crucial-Diff integrates SAFE for unified feature extraction and WASM to generate hard-to-detect samples using downstream model feedback.

Result: Achieves 83.63% pixel-level AP and 78.12% F1-MAX on MVTec, and 81.64% mIoU and 87.69% mDice on polyp dataset.

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff effectively synthesizes diverse, high-quality training data, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates zero-shot performance of LLMs (GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition using image inputs, finding Gemini 2.0 Flash superior with a 56.79% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in fashion product attribution, a critical task for e-commerce, given their under-explored performance in fine-grained attribute recognition.

Method: Zero-shot evaluation of LLMs on the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, focusing on 18 fashion attributes using only image inputs.

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o-mini with a macro F1 score of 56.79% vs. 43.28%, highlighting strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of LLMs in fashion AI but emphasizes the need for domain-specific fine-tuning for practical e-commerce applications.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to overcome radiation damage in electron microscopy for beam-sensitive materials by using multi-image super-resolution and a CNN, achieving atomic-scale resolution with ultra-low-dose data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation damage limits electron microscopy for beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials, necessitating a solution to achieve high resolution without excessive electron dose.

Method: The method combines multi-image super-resolution (MISR) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhance reconstruction. A dual-path, attention-guided network is developed for 4D-STEM.

Result: The approach achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data, comparable to conventional ptychography, and works across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline specimens.

Conclusion: This work extends 4D-STEM capabilities, providing a generalizable solution for structural analysis of radiation-sensitive materials.

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KPHD-Net improves multi-view classification and clustering by using Hölder divergence and Dempster-Shafer theory for better uncertainty estimation and fusion reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use KL divergence, ignoring domain gaps between modalities, leading to unreliable multi-view integration.

Method: KPHD-Net employs variational Dirichlet distributions, models evidences, and integrates Hölder divergence with Dempster-Shafer theory and Kalman filtering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and reliability for classification and clustering tasks.

Conclusion: KPHD-Net provides a theoretically sound and effective solution for reliable multi-view learning.

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoders in LDMs lack simultaneous satisfaction of latent smoothness, perceptual compression, and reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes VMAEs, leveraging Masked AutoEncoder features, and integrates them into LDMs as LDMAEs.

Result: LDMAEs show improved image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VMAEs enhance LDM performance by addressing autoencoder limitations.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 3DGAA is a novel adversarial attack framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to optimize both geometry and appearance, outperforming existing methods in reducing detection accuracy and maintaining transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D/3D adversarial attacks lack balance between physical realism and robustness, limiting their effectiveness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: 3DGAA leverages 14D parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting to perturb geometry (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance (color, opacity), with physical filtering and augmentation modules for realism and generalization.

Result: 3DGAA reduces detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, outperforming existing methods and showing high transferability across physical conditions.

Conclusion: 3DGAA sets a new state-of-the-art for physically realizable adversarial attacks, proving practical for evaluating autonomous driving perception safety.

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild

*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I-BSC, an improved method over P-BSC, to reduce motion errors in dynamic 3D scanning by weighting fringe images instead of phase frames, achieving faster computation and better error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP's static object assumption fails in dynamic measurements, causing motion errors. P-BSC addresses this but has computational and error accumulation issues.

Method: I-BSC weights homogeneous fringe images (not phase frames) and computes the arctangent once, reducing complexity and improving speed.

Result: I-BSC outperforms existing methods in motion error reduction, achieves quasi-single-shot frame rates, and accelerates computation significantly.

Conclusion: I-BSC generalizes BSC to image sequences, resolving P-BSC's limitations and enabling high-resolution 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Result: VLMs (ResNet and ViT) do not consistently show the bouba-kiki effect, differing from human cognition.

Conclusion: VLMs' cross-modal understanding is limited, highlighting gaps in their alignment with human intuitions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

*Jaisidh Singh,Diganta Misra,Boris Knyazev,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyma proposes a hypernetwork-based solution for efficient uni-modal model selection and connector training in multi-modal models, reducing search costs by 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and computational demands of selecting and aligning uni-modal models for multi-modal tasks motivate an efficient solution.

Method: Hyma leverages hypernetworks to jointly train connector modules for multiple uni-modal model combinations, avoiding exhaustive grid search.

Result: Hyma reduces search costs by 10x while maintaining performance comparable to grid search.

Conclusion: Hyma offers a scalable and efficient approach for aligning uni-modal models in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

*Seokeon Choi,Sunghyun Park,Hyoungwoo Park,Jeongho Kim,Sungrack Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective optimization framework for memory-efficient personalization of text-to-image diffusion models, combining BP-low and ZO-high methods dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt diffusion models for personalization while preserving privacy and reducing computational resource usage on edge devices.

Method: Uses BP-low for target-specific adaptation and ZO-high for high-resolution refinement, guided by a timestep-aware probabilistic function.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with reduced memory consumption, enabling scalable on-device personalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances efficiency and quality, making it suitable for edge device applications.

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LifelongPR is a continual learning framework for point cloud place recognition (PCPR) that addresses catastrophic forgetting by dynamically selecting replay samples and using prompt learning for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCPR models suffer from catastrophic forgetting, reducing scalability and practicality in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes a replay sample selection method for knowledge retention and a prompt learning-based CL framework for domain adaptation.

Result: Achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% in mR@1, and 8.95% reduction in F compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: LifelongPR effectively mitigates forgetting and adapts to new domains, enhancing PCPR performance and practicality.

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream
Segmentation (PSS) in comic books, a critical task for automated content
understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for
scalable comic book analysis.

TL;DR: A lightweight ML approach using fecal image analysis detects poultry diseases with high accuracy and low resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poultry farming is vulnerable to diseases; a cost-effective, scalable solution is needed.

Method: Multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) with descriptors like LBP, wavelet transforms, and edge detectors. Dimensionality reduction via PCA and XGBoost. ANN classifier.

Result: 95.85% accuracy, no GPU needed, 638s execution time. Comparable to deep learning but more efficient.

Conclusion: Proposed model is cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable for low-resource settings.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Motivation: To enable unified modeling of dynamic 3D scenes for tasks like view synthesis, reconstruction, and 3D tracking without heavy task-specific supervision.

Method: Uses pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives with explicit motion supervision, allowing large-scale training on diverse datasets.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with significant speedups, supporting zero-shot applications like scene flow estimation.

Conclusion: MoVieS is effective, efficient, and versatile for dynamic scene modeling and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified

By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency

### [111] [Frequency Regulation for Exposure Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10072)
*Meng Yu,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses exposure bias in diffusion models by analyzing energy reduction in noisy images and introduces a frequency-domain regulation method to improve generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from exposure bias, impacting their generative capabilities. The study aims to mitigate this by analyzing energy patterns in noisy images.

Method: The authors use wavelet transforms to regulate low- and high-frequency subbands separately, based on observed energy reduction patterns.

Result: The proposed training-free method significantly enhances generative quality and provides a robust solution to exposure bias across model architectures.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain regulation mechanism effectively addresses exposure bias, improving diffusion model performance without additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

TL;DR: A two-stage transfer learning strategy using SegFormer improves water body segmentation in remote sensing, boosting IoU from 25.50% to 64.84%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shift and small sample sizes in remote sensing water body segmentation.

Method: Two-stage transfer learning: train on a diverse source domain, then fine-tune on a target domain (Zhada Tulin area).

Result: IoU improved from 25.50% (direct transfer) to 64.84%.

Conclusion: The strategy resolves domain discrepancy and aids high-precision thematic extraction in data-scarce, unique environments.

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

TL;DR: FIX-CLIP enhances CLIP for long-text tasks by introducing dual-branch training, regional prompts, and hierarchical feature alignment, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's limitation with long-text inputs (>77 tokens) hinders performance on under-stream tasks, prompting the need for an improved solution.

Method: Proposes FIX-CLIP with three modules: dual-branch training, regional prompts with unidirectional masks, and hierarchical feature alignment. Uses 30M images and synthetic long-text captions for training.

Result: FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on long- and short-text retrieval benchmarks and improves diffusion models with long-text input.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP effectively addresses CLIP's long-text limitations while maintaining short-text performance, offering practical downstream applications.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure consistent global identity assignment across multiple camera views for accurate multi-target tracking.

Method: Uses BoT-SORT for single-camera tracking, initializes global IDs via trajectory-feature matching, and employs a prioritized global matching strategy for later frames. 3D positions are estimated for spatial validation.

Result: Achieves consistent global identity assignment by combining trajectory and appearance cues, with new IDs introduced only when no match is found.

Conclusion: The proposed MCMT framework effectively maintains global identity consistency across views, enhancing multi-target tracking accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEARLi, a novel semi-supervised panoptic segmentation method using foundation models to address label scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming, and existing semi-supervised methods lack effective mechanisms to exploit foundation models for label scarcity.

Method: DEARLi combines unsupervised mask-transformer consistency with CLIP's zero-shot classification for recognition and class-agnostic decoder warm-up with SAM pseudo-labels for localization.

Result: DEARLi outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, achieving 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images, while using 8x less GPU memory.

Conclusion: DEARLi effectively decouples and enhances recognition and localization, excelling in challenging semi-supervised scenarios with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

TL;DR: The paper explores SOTA point tracking methods for echocardiography, identifies directional motion bias, refines training, and proposes a lightweight network, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate motion estimation in echocardiography is crucial for cardiac function measurements, but existing methods struggle with intricate cardiac motion and lack exploration of modern point tracking approaches.

Method: The study refines training procedures with tailored augmentations to reduce bias and introduces a lightweight network using multi-scale cost volumes for robust tracking.

Result: Fine-tuning improves performance by 60.7% in position accuracy and 61.5% in trajectory error reduction. The proposed model outperforms some SOTA methods in accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The refined methods enhance tracking robustness and reproducibility in clinical applications, aligning better with expert-validated tools.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological vision systems use feedback for iterative refinement, but most artificial neural networks are purely feedforward. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A recurrent feedback loop is added to a U-Net, with softmax projection and exponential decay for stability. Tested on synthetic segmentation tasks.

Result: Feedback outperforms feedforward models in noise and generalizes better with limited data, achieving above-random performance with just two training examples.

Conclusion: Feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, paving the way for more adaptive, biologically inspired neural architectures.

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

TL;DR: A dual-level domain adaptation method for text-based person retrieval addresses the synthetic-to-real gap using image and region-level techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain gap between synthetic pretraining data and real-world datasets hinders retrieval performance, necessitating domain adaptation.

Method: Proposes Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-level adaptation effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real gap, improving retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

TL;DR: ECP is a training-free, task-agnostic framework to improve MLLM performance on high-resolution images by leveraging coarse predictions for fine-grained localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution images due to fixed resolution fine-tuning, leading to poor generalization or loss of details.

Method: ECP uses a two-stage approach: extract candidate regions from downsampled images, then predict final outputs on these regions to preserve details.

Result: Achieves +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement in 4K GUI grounding and 4K/8K MLLM perception tasks.

Conclusion: ECP effectively enhances MLLM performance on high-resolution images without additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

### [121] [Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203)
*Shicai Wei,Chunbo Luo,Yang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Asymmetric Representation Learning (ARL) for multimodal learning, arguing that imbalanced modality dependency, inversely proportional to their variances, optimizes performance. ARL uses auxiliary regularizers to re-weight modality optimization without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning often underperforms unimodal learning due to imbalanced modality optimization. Existing gradient balancing methods are suboptimal.

Method: ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers to calculate modality variances and biases, re-weighting optimization inversely to variance ratios. It avoids extra parameters by sharing them with the multimodal model.

Result: Experiments show ARL's effectiveness and versatility across datasets.

Conclusion: ARL demonstrates that imbalanced modality dependency, aligned with variance ratios, enhances multimodal learning performance without additional parameters.

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

### [122] [Is Micro-expression Ethnic Leaning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10209)
*Huai-Qian Khor,Yante Li,Xingxun Jiang,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges Ekman's universality hypothesis of emotions by investigating ethnic influences on micro-expression recognition, proposing an ethnically aware framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how ethnicity affects emotional expression and micro-expression analysis, challenging the assumption of universal emotional expressions.

Method: Constructs a cross-cultural micro-expression database with ethnic labels, performs controlled experiments comparing mono- and stereo-ethnicity, and develops an ethnically aware framework for micro-expression recognition.

Result: Finds ethnic bias in micro-expression recognition and proposes a framework integrating ethnic context, improving recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Ethnicity significantly influences micro-expression recognition, and the proposed framework enhances accuracy by accounting for ethnic differences.

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

### [123] [Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10213)
*Shicai Wei,Chunbo Luo,Yang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies optimization conflicts in multimodal learning, proposes a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to improve performance, and validates its effectiveness across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning underperforms unimodal learning due to gradient conflicts between modality encoders and fusion modules.

Method: Proposes DGL to decouple gradients: uses unimodal loss for encoders and removes interference for fusion modules.

Result: DGL improves performance across diverse modalities, tasks, and frameworks.

Conclusion: DGL effectively resolves optimization conflicts, enhancing multimodal learning performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

*Jeongho Kim,Sunghyun Park,Hyoungwoo Park,Sungrack Yun,Jaegul Choo,Seokeon Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA introduces a part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation, eliminating inference-time fine-tuning and large-scale training while improving fidelity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized human image generation faces challenges in preserving precise attributes (e.g., identity, clothing details) without costly fine-tuning or large datasets.

Method: The method trains only LoRA layers, conditions generation on wardrobe and spatial references, and uses a selective subject region loss to align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity.

Result: The approach outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis with minimal training samples.

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA offers a practical, efficient solution for personalized human image generation without additional inference parameters.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

TL;DR: VRFNO improves Reflow by optimizing noise couplings and enhancing trajectory distinction, achieving better image generation in fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflow's limitations in generating high-quality images due to distribution gaps between noise-image couplings and real images.

Method: VRFNO integrates an encoder and neural velocity field, introducing a historical velocity term and noise optimization via reparameterization.

Result: VRFNO outperforms Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Conclusion: VRFNO effectively addresses Reflow's shortcomings, offering superior image generation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

TL;DR: Spatial Lifting (SL) lifts 2D inputs to higher dimensions (e.g., 3D) for dense prediction tasks, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and accuracy in dense prediction tasks by leveraging higher-dimensional processing.

Method: Lifts 2D inputs (e.g., images) to higher dimensions (e.g., 3D) and processes them with networks like 3D U-Net.

Result: Validated on 19 datasets, SL reduces parameters by 98% and lowers inference costs while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: SL offers a new paradigm for efficient, accurate, and reliable dense prediction in vision tasks.

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProGait, a dataset for vision-based gait analysis of prosthetic legs, addressing challenges in prosthesis detection and analysis. It includes benchmarks and baseline models showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve gait analysis for prosthetic legs using scalable, non-invasive vision-based ML methods, overcoming challenges posed by unique prosthesis appearances and movement patterns.

Method: Developed the ProGait dataset with 412 video clips from amputees, supporting tasks like Video Object Segmentation and Gait Analysis. Provided benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models.

Result: Baseline models outperformed pre-trained vision models, demonstrating better generalizability for prosthesis-specific tasks.

Conclusion: ProGait effectively bridges the gap in vision-based gait analysis for prosthetic legs, offering a practical solution with its dataset and models.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynOOD leverages foundation models to generate synthetic OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP, improving boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging OOD samples near InD data can misclassify; foundation models offer a solution.

Method: Uses MLLM-guided in-painting and noise adjustments to create boundary-aligned OOD samples, then fine-tunes CLIP.

Result: Achieves SOTA on ImageNet: +2.80% AUROC, -11.13% FPR95.

Conclusion: SynOOD effectively enhances OOD detection with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Motivation: The rise of AI-generated images threatens digital trust, but current AID models fail in real-world scenarios despite strong benchmark performance.

Method: The study evaluates AID models using the ITW-SM dataset, analyzing backbone architecture, training data, pre-processing, and augmentation.

Result: Modifications based on the analysis improve AID models' AUC by 26.87% in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The work highlights critical factors for enhancing AID models' real-world effectiveness, offering practical improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

*Ben Hamscher,Edgar Heinert,Annika Mütze,Kira Maag,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style transfer augmentation in semantic segmentation reduces texture bias and improves robustness against corruptions and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if style transfer can reduce texture bias and enhance robustness in semantic segmentation, similar to its effects in image classification.

Method: Style transfer with varying styles across artificial Voronoi cell areas, used to train semantic segmentation DNNs.

Result: Reduced texture bias and increased robustness to corruptions and adversarial attacks in both CNN and transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Style transfer is effective for reducing texture bias and improving robustness in semantic segmentation, generalizing across datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA) to disrupt camera pose estimation by using symmetric background textures, enhancing attack effectiveness with a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Background textures in sparse input scenarios can degrade pose estimation accuracy, prompting the need for adversarial attacks to test model robustness.

Method: KBA uses identical segments to create symmetric discs, maintaining high viewpoint similarity. A projected orientation consistency loss optimizes these segments.

Result: Optimized adversarial backgrounds successfully attack various pose estimation models.

Conclusion: KBA demonstrates the vulnerability of pose estimation models to adversarial backgrounds, highlighting the need for robust solutions.

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTCFormer introduces a clustering-based downsampling module for dynamic vision token generation, improving feature representation by focusing on semantic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformer architectures use uniform grid-based tokens, ignoring semantic meanings of image regions, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: FTCFormer uses clustering (DPC-FKNN), spatial connectivity scoring (SCS), and channel-wise merging (Cmerge) to generate and merge tokens based on semantics.

Result: FTCFormer outperforms TCFormer, with gains of 1.43% (fine-grained), 1.09% (natural), 0.97% (medical), and 0.55% (remote sensing) across 32 datasets.

Conclusion: FTCFormer effectively enhances feature representation by prioritizing semantic regions, validated by consistent improvements across diverse domains.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IP-FVR is a novel face video restoration method that uses a high-quality reference image for identity conditioning, employing decoupled cross-attention and feedback learning to minimize identity drift and enhance restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to preserve identity-specific features in severely degraded face videos, often producing generic results. IP-FVR aims to address this by leveraging reference images for identity consistency.

Method: IP-FVR uses decoupled cross-attention for identity conditioning, feedback learning for intra-clip drift, exponential blending for inter-clip drift, and multi-stream negative prompts to guide restoration.

Result: IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in quality and identity preservation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: IP-FVR offers a robust solution for face video restoration, ensuring detailed and identity-consistent results with practical applications.

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack domain-specific reasoning for facial cues due to limited annotated datasets. FaceLLM addresses this gap for tasks like facial structure, expression, and emotion analysis.

Method: A weakly supervised pipeline uses ChatGPT to generate annotated question-answer pairs (FairFaceGPT) from FairFace images. FaceLLM is trained on this dataset.

Result: FaceLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on face-centric tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of synthetic supervision via language models.

Conclusion: FaceLLM sets a precedent for domain-specialized MLLMs and trustworthy human-centric AI, with publicly available datasets and models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

### [135] [DisCo: Towards Distinct and Coherent Visual Encapsulation in Video MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10302)
*Jiahe Zhao,Rongkun Zheng,Yi Wang,Helin Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo is a novel visual encapsulation method for video MLLMs, addressing semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence with a Visual Concept Discriminator and Temporal Focus Calibrator, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear projectors in video MLLMs cause semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence; resamplers show promise but lack effective solutions.

Method: DisCo integrates a Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) for unique semantics and a Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) for temporal coherence.

Result: DisCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video understanding benchmarks and improves token efficiency.

Conclusion: DisCo effectively enhances video MLLMs by providing semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens.

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

### [136] [Contrastive Pretraining with Dual Visual Encoders for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10306)
*Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) outperforms single-stream variants and achieves top BLEU-4 scores on Phoenix-2014T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early SLT systems relied on costly gloss annotations, which often miss the complexity of continuous signing. This work aims to bypass gloss annotations for more efficient and accurate translation.

Method: Proposes a two-phase framework: pretraining with dual visual encoders aligned via contrastive learning, followed by downstream SLT using fused visual features in an encoder-decoder model.

Result: The dual encoder architecture outperforms single-stream variants and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score on the Phoenix-2014T benchmark among gloss-free SLT methods.

Conclusion: The proposed gloss-free SLT approach is effective, leveraging contrastive pretraining and dual encoders to improve translation accuracy without relying on gloss annotations.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

### [137] [Mind the Gap: Aligning Vision Foundation Models to Image Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10318)
*Yuhan Liu,Jingwen Fu,Yang Wu,Kangyi Wu,Pengna Li,Jiayi Wu,Sanping Zhou,Jingmin Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMD, a framework using diffusion models for image feature matching, addressing misalignment issues in foundation models and improving performance in multi-instance scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works overlooked misalignment when using foundation models for feature matching, leading to poor performance in multi-instance scenarios.

Method: IMD integrates diffusion models for instance-level details and introduces a cross-image interaction prompting module for bidirectional information exchange.

Result: IMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 12% improvement in the new IMIM benchmark for multi-instance scenarios.

Conclusion: IMD effectively mitigates misalignment in foundation models for feature matching, demonstrating superior performance in multi-instance tasks.

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QLIP introduces a text-prompt-guided quantization method for diffusion models, reducing computational complexity while improving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for diffusion models ignore input conditions like text prompts, limiting efficiency and performance.

Method: QLIP uses text prompts to dynamically select bit precision per layer and time step, integrating with existing quantization techniques.

Result: QLIP reduces computational complexity and enhances image quality across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: QLIP effectively addresses the limitations of current quantization methods by leveraging text prompts for efficient and high-quality diffusion model performance.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGSSNet improves wall segmentation in floorplans using a multi-headed feature-guided U-Net architecture with domain-specific feature injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generalization in wall segmentation by leveraging domain-specific features.

Method: Uses a U-Net backbone with a multi-headed feature extractor trained on wall patches to guide segmentation and predict wall width.

Result: Outperforms vanilla U-Net, validating the feature-guided approach.

Conclusion: FGSSNet's feature injection improves wall segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

*Bo Jiang,Xueyang Ze,Beibei Wang,Xixi Wang,Xixi Wan,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VRGAdapter, a Vertex Random Graph Adapter, to capture diverse textual descriptions and inter-class relationships in Vision-Language Models, enhancing downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic textual adapters fail to capture the diversity in textual descriptions and inter-class relationships, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: VRGAdapter uses a Vertex Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) to model diverse descriptions and inter-class relationships, employs probabilistic message propagation, and adopts a reparameterized sampling function for adapter learning. An Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme is also introduced for robust ensemble prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of VRGAdapter.

Conclusion: VRGAdapter offers a more general and effective solution for adapter-based tuning in VLMs, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD), addressing the challenge of detecting visually similar objects. It proposes the MSHC method and a new dataset, FGZSD-Birds, showing superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object detection (ZSD) works focus on coarse-grained detection, but real-life scenarios often involve fine-grained objects with minute differences, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The MSHC method, based on an improved two-stage detector, uses multi-level semantics-aware embedding alignment loss to align visual and semantic spaces.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing ZSD models on the newly created FGZSD-Birds dataset, which includes 148,820 images across 1,432 species.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the FG-ZSD problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of MSHC and highlighting the need for fine-grained datasets in ZSD research.

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on specialized architectures or predefined augmentations, limiting generalization to diverse transformations.

Method: FOCAL generates and optimizes candidate transformations toward visually typical views using foundation models.

Result: Improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts, and day-night variations.

Conclusion: FOCAL offers a scalable path to invariance, challenging the need for transform-specific training.

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

TL;DR: A TDA feature engineering pipeline integrates topological features with deep learning, improving ResNet18 performance on remote sensing datasets, surpassing larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CNN bias towards texture features and enhance model performance by leveraging TDA's geometric insights.

Method: Proposes a TDA feature engineering pipeline to integrate topological features with deep learning models like ResNet18.

Result: Achieves 99.33% accuracy on EuroSAT (1.44% improvement) and outperforms ResNet18 baseline by 1.82% on RESISC45.

Conclusion: TDA features can effectively enhance deep learning models, even in datasets without explicit topological structures, broadening TDA's applicability.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning approach for recognizing handwritten Devanagari characters, achieving high accuracy (96.36% testing, 99.55% training).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of digitization tools for the Devanagari script and the growing need for applications like search engines and social media drive this research.

Method: Uses two deep convolutional neural network layers on the Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), with 36 classes and 1700 images per class.

Result: Achieves 96.36% accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances recognition rates for Devanagari handwritten text, demonstrating high accuracy.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this
research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari
script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%
accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrisisLandMark introduces a large-scale corpus of SAR and multispectral images with structured text annotations, and CLOSP aligns optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space, improving retrieval performance by 54%. GeoCLOSP further enhances location-dependent tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, missing valuable information from other sensors like SAR and multispectral data.

Method: Developed CrisisLandMark corpus and CLOSP framework to align optical and SAR images using text, with GeoCLOSP incorporating geographic coordinates.

Result: CLOSP improves retrieval nDGC by 54% and GeoCLOSP excels in location-dependent tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse sensor data and geographic context is key to maximizing remote sensing archive potential.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-AGIQA is a new framework for assessing AI-generated image quality by addressing semantic misalignment and detail perception issues through text-visual semantic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating AI-generated images struggle with semantic misalignment and missing details, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The framework integrates two modules: TSAM for semantic alignment using MLLMs and FFDPM for fine-grained distortion perception via frequency-domain analysis.

Result: SC-AGIQA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances the evaluation of AI-generated images by combining semantic and perceptual quality assessments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on labor-intensive keypoints, which are unreliable due to limited training data.

Method: Uses a dense feature network for SMAL parameter mapping and hierarchical alignment with silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues.

Result: Outperforms model-based and model-free baselines, producing high-quality 3D assets.

Conclusion: 4D-Animal offers efficient, stable, and scalable 3D animal reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coral reefs need monitoring, but interpreting images requires expertise. VQA can help, but lacks domain-specific datasets.

Method: Developed CoralVQA with 12,805 coral images and 277,653 QA pairs using a semi-automatic pipeline involving marine biologists.

Result: Evaluated LVLMs, revealing limitations and opportunities for coral reef image analysis.

Conclusion: CoralVQA sets a benchmark for LVLM development, supporting coral conservation through improved vision-language reasoning.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

Motivation: Traditional CNNs use uniform kernels, ignoring local content variations in pansharpening. RAPNet aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: RAPNet uses RAPConv for spatially adaptive kernels and PAN-DFF with attention for optimal spatial-spectral fusion.

Result: RAPNet outperforms existing methods on public datasets, validated by metrics and visual assessments.

Conclusion: RAPNet's adaptive components effectively enhance pansharpening, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

*Zhicun Yin,Junjie Chen,Ming Liu,Zhixin Wang,Fan Li,Renjing Pei,Xiaoming Li,Rynson W. H. Lau,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefSTAR introduces a novel blind facial image restoration method using reference images, focusing on selection, transfer, and reconstruction to improve identity preservation and feature transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with identity preservation due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures in facial image restoration.

Method: Proposes RefSTAR with modules for reference selection (RefSel), feature fusion for transfer, and reconstruction with cycle consistency loss. Uses a RefSel-HQ dataset for training.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in identity preservation and reference feature transfer across various backbone models.

Conclusion: RefSTAR effectively addresses blind facial image restoration challenges by leveraging high-quality reference images and novel feature integration techniques.

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

*David G. Shatwell,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GT-Loc is a retrieval-based method jointly predicting image capture time (hour/month) and geo-location (GPS) using aligned embeddings in a shared feature space, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timestamp prediction and geo-localization are interdependent due to visual cues like brightness and shadows being geographically dependent. GT-Loc addresses this by jointly optimizing both tasks.

Method: GT-Loc uses separate encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings in a shared space. It introduces a temporal metric-learning objective for cyclical time modeling.

Result: GT-Loc surpasses previous time prediction methods, even those using ground-truth geo-location, and achieves competitive geo-localization results. It also enables compositional and text-based retrieval.

Conclusion: GT-Loc effectively addresses the interdependence of timestamp prediction and geo-localization, offering superior performance and versatile applications.

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining federated learning, indoor localization, and vision-based systems achieves 99.99% accuracy for fall detection in older adults, ensuring reliability and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the aging population increases fall risks, necessitating timely, effective, and privacy-conscious detection systems.

Method: Proposes SF2D (semi-supervised federated learning), indoor localization/navigation, and vision-based detection systems for fall recognition.

Result: SF2D achieves 99.19% accuracy, vision-based detection 96.3%, and navigation 95%, combining for 99.99% overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework is highly reliable, safe, and privacy-preserving for fall detection in older adults.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

*Tugberk Erol,Tuba Caglikantar,Duygu Sarikaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A confidence-based self-distillation method is proposed for polyp segmentation, reducing resource usage while outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, over-parameterized models in polyp detection suffer from overfitting and poor generalization. Existing distillation methods are resource-intensive.

Method: Uses confidence-based self-distillation with dynamic confidence coefficients, requiring only previous iteration data storage.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient and effective, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

*Chenyu Lian,Hong-Yu Zhou,Zhanli Hu,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, addressing gaps in existing methods by leveraging labeled and unlabeled data. It proposes NFM-DRA, a new method combining disentangled representations with a memory bank, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive benchmark for retinal anomaly detection has hindered progress, limiting evaluation fairness and methodology advancement. Existing benchmarks focus narrowly on one-class supervised approaches, ignoring available labeled abnormal and unlabeled data.

Method: The authors introduce a systematic benchmark and propose NFM-DRA, which integrates disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) with a Normal Feature Memory to improve performance on unseen anomalies.

Result: NFM-DRA outperforms previous methods, setting a new state-of-the-art, though it still faces performance drops on certain unseen anomalies.

Conclusion: The benchmark and NFM-DRA method advance retinal anomaly detection by addressing key limitations, offering a robust tool for future research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

*Ruilong Li,Brent Yi,Junchen Liu,Hang Gao,Yi Ma,Angjoo Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares methods for conditioning transformers on camera geometry in multi-view vision tasks, proposing a new encoding (PRoPE) that improves performance in tasks like novel view synthesis and stereo depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage geometric relationships between viewpoints for better 3D perception in multi-view transformers.

Method: Comparison of token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and the proposed PRoPE, which encodes complete camera frustums.

Result: PRoPE outperforms other methods in novel view synthesis and generalizes well to varying intrinsics and tasks like stereo depth estimation.

Conclusion: PRoPE effectively captures camera geometry, enhancing transformer performance across diverse multi-view vision tasks.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

*Philippe Rufin,Pauline Lucie Hammer,Leon-Friedrich Thomas,Sá Nogueira Lisboa,Natasha Ribeiro,Almeida Sitoe,Patrick Hostert,Patrick Meyfroidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using high-resolution Earth observation data and deep transfer learning to map crop fields in Mozambique, achieving high accuracy and providing insights into smallholder agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of smallholder agriculture systems, particularly spatial distribution and field size, for better sustainability policies.

Method: Integration of very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation data with deep transfer learning to delineate crop fields at a national scale.

Result: Produced a national dataset of 21 million fields in Mozambique with 93% accuracy, revealing fragmented rural regions and varying field sizes linked to socio-economic and environmental factors.

Conclusion: Field size is a critical indicator for understanding agricultural outcomes and trade-offs, aiding in the design of science-based policies.

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

*Borui Zhang,Qihang Rao,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQ transforms pre-trained VAEs into VQ-VAEs efficiently, reducing training costs by 100x while maintaining competitive image reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs is computationally expensive. This work aims to reduce the cost by leveraging pre-trained VAEs.

Method: ReVQ uses channel multi-group quantization and a post rectifier to mitigate errors, enabling rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal overhead.

Result: ReVQ compresses ImageNet into 512 tokens with rFID=1.06 and reduces training time from 4.5 days on 32 GPUs to 22 hours on a single GPU.

Conclusion: ReVQ offers a superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-off, making high-compression VQ-VAEs more accessible.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmRACE-3K, a dataset for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in embodied settings, highlighting their limitations in interactive tasks and proposing a fine-tuning approach to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well in passive tasks but struggle in embodied, interactive environments requiring active scene understanding and spatial reasoning.

Method: The authors create EmRACE-3K, a dataset of 3,000 language-guided tasks in photorealistic environments, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised and reinforcement learning.

Result: Zero-shot VLMs achieve below 20% success rates, while fine-tuning improves performance across exploration, spatial-semantic reasoning, and multi-stage goal execution.

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K effectively benchmarks and enhances VLMs' embodied reasoning, addressing current limitations in interactive environments.

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.
