<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether powerful large language models, particularly multi-modality Vision Language Models, can benefit end-to-end autonomous driving tasks, moving beyond traditional modular deep neural network approaches.

Conclusion: The results show the strong potential of VLMs for end-to-end driving tasks and validate the effectiveness of vision-based driving approaches using only camera inputs.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

### [2] [PixFoundation 2.0: Do Video Multi-Modal LLMs Use Motion in Visual Grounding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02807)
*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoCentric-Bench, a motion-centric benchmark to evaluate video MLLMs' ability to perform pixel-level visual grounding using motion patterns, addressing limitations in current benchmarks where static frames often suffice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video MLLMs show impressive generalization but their pixel-level visual grounding abilities using motion are understudied. Existing benchmarks often don't require temporal reasoning as single frames can capture motion expressions.

Method: The authors introduce four motion-centric probing techniques to study video MLLMs' ability to identify true motion vs fake motion and understand motion order. They create MoCentric-Bench to ensure models leverage motion-language interactions rather than static appearance cues.

Result: The study establishes strong single-image baselines that perform on par with prior methods. Simple motion-centric adaptation techniques achieve state-of-the-art performance on the new benchmark.

Conclusion: The motion-centric benchmark challenges future models to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding in videos, moving beyond static appearance-based evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of colon cancer is crucial to prevent deterioration, requiring advanced diagnostic models that can effectively analyze histopathological images.

Method: HG-TNet model with hybrid architecture combining transformers (for global context) and CNNs (for local details), using capsule networks to preserve spatial relationships and self-supervised rotation prediction.

Result: The proposed model shows better performance in accuracy and loss function compared to standard architectures, effectively capturing multi-scale features in histopathological images.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining transformers and CNNs with capsule networks and self-supervised learning produces robust diagnostic representations that advance colon cancer classification capabilities.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

### [4] [PRECISE-AS: Personalized Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Point-of-Care Echocardiography in Aortic Stenosis Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02898)
*Armin Saadat,Nima Hashemi,Hooman Vaseli,Michael Y. Tsang,Christina Luong,Michiel Van de Panne,Teresa S. M. Tsang,Purang Abolmaesumi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-based active video acquisition framework for aortic stenosis diagnosis that dynamically selects the most informative echo videos, achieving 80.6% accuracy while using only 47% of videos compared to full acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited access to echocardiography in resource-constrained areas and overcome operator expertise limitations of point-of-care ultrasound by developing a more efficient diagnostic approach.

Method: Reinforcement learning-driven active video acquisition framework that continuously evaluates whether additional imaging is needed and dynamically selects each patient's most informative echo videos.

Result: Achieved 80.6% classification accuracy using only 47% of echo videos compared to full acquisition, tested on data from 2,572 patients.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential to enhance aortic stenosis diagnosis by making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and personalized.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Motivation: To address duplication of efforts in lidar research where researchers develop niche-specific code that shares common methodological steps, and to enable easier code sharing and adaptation when research focus changes.

Method: Developed LiGuard framework with built-in support for data I/O, pre/post processing, common algorithms, interactive algorithm management, and visualization capabilities for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking tasks.

Result: The framework creates structured code files in organized directories, enabling easy sharing of entire projects or individual components for reuse by other researchers.

Conclusion: LiGuard effectively addresses the challenges of code duplication and revision difficulties in lidar research, as demonstrated through case studies, providing a reusable framework for the research community.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

### [6] [PercepTwin: Modeling High-Fidelity Digital Twins for Sim2Real LiDAR-based Perception for Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02903)
*Muhammad Shahbaz,Shaurya Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A methodology for creating high-quality synthetic LiDAR datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins to address the cost and scalability issues of real-world data collection for ITS perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based perception systems require large labeled datasets that are costly and time-consuming to create, hindering scalability. Sim2Real learning offers an alternative but depends on simulation fidelity to real-world conditions.

Method: Proposes a rigorous workflow using High-Fidelity Digital Twins to replicate real-world environments through static geometry modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario generation, leveraging open-source resources like satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data.

Result: Enables creation of scalable, cost-effective, and diverse synthetic datasets that form a reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning in intelligent transportation systems.

Conclusion: The methodology provides practical guidance for constructing high-fidelity synthetic environments that facilitate effective Sim2Real transfer learning, addressing the data scalability challenges in LiDAR-based perception systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

*Muhammad Shahbaz,Shaurya Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HiFi DT framework for Sim2Real transfer in LiDAR perception, showing 4.8% improvement over real-data training through better domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the Sim2Real performance gap in LiDAR-based perception for ITS, where models trained in simulation underperform on real-world data due to distributional shifts.

Method: Develops a high-fidelity digital twin framework incorporating real-world background geometry, road topology, and sensor specifications. Uses systematic environment construction and evaluates domain alignment with metrics like Chamfer Distance, MMD, EMD, and Fréchet Distance.

Result: DT-trained model outperforms equivalent real-data trained model by 4.8%. HiFi DTs substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Digital twins play a significant role in enabling reliable simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world ITS applications by effectively bridging the Sim2Real gap.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG is a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy classification that combines vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning using clinical lesion ontologies and retinal vessel segmentation, achieving significant improvements in cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of domain generalization in medical imaging where models trained on single sources fail under real-world distribution shifts, particularly for diabetic retinopathy classification.

Minimizes KL divergence between domain embeddings to enforce alignment of clinical semantics.

Result: Achieves up to 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Symbolic-only model achieves 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves highest accuracy in SDG scenarios. Lesion-based features achieve 84.65% accuracy.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration establishes a promising paradigm for building clinically robust and domain-invariant medical AI systems, with symbolic components acting as effective regularizers beyond interpretability enhancement.

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for WSI registration are computationally intensive and difficult to reproduce, while lightweight rigid frameworks suitable for consecutive-section scenarios remain underdeveloped despite being sufficient for many applications.

Method: STAR integrates stain-conditioned preprocessing with hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive kernel scaling, and built-in quality control for reliable rigid registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols.

Result: Evaluated on ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and partial tissue overlap across multiple organs and scanning conditions.

Conclusion: STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers barriers for clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for next-generation computational pathology, with demonstrated utility in H&E-IHC alignment and multi-IHC panel construction.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

### [11] [Resilient Multimodal Industrial Surface Defect Detection with Uncertain Sensors Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02962)
*Shuai Jiang,Yunfeng Ma,Jingyu Zhou,Yuan Bian,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes cross-modal prompt learning and symmetric contrastive learning to handle modality-missing problems in multimodal industrial surface defect detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensor availability in multimodal industrial surface defect detection, where traditional fusion methods struggle with learning mode transformation and information vacancy.

Method: Cross-modal prompt learning with three components: cross-modal consistency prompt, modality-specific prompt, and missing-aware prompt. Plus symmetric contrastive learning using text modality as a bridge for dual vision modalities fusion with paired antithetical text prompts and triple-modal contrastive pre-training.

Result: Achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by 3.84% and 5.58% respectively. Outperforms existing approaches under different missing types and rates.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles modality-missing problems in industrial defect detection through innovative prompt learning and contrastive learning techniques, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

### [12] [EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964)
*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet improves solar filament segmentation by integrating learnable edge maps into attention mechanisms, achieving better accuracy and barb recognition than U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture fine-scale filament structures like barbs due to limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail, which is critical for determining filament chirality and CME behavior.

Method: Proposes EdgeAttNet architecture based on U-Net with novel learnable edge map derived from input image. The edge map linearly transforms attention Key and Query matrices to guide self-attention mechanism for better boundary and barb capture.

Result: Outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on MAGFILO dataset with higher segmentation accuracy, significantly better barb recognition, and faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Explicit integration of structural prior through edge-guided attention enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing trainable parameters, making it effective for solar filament analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

*Yujin Wang,Tianyi Wang,Quanfeng Liu,Wenxian Fan,Junfeng Jiao,Christian Claudel,Yunbing Yan,Bingzhao Gao,Jianqiang Wang,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KEPT is a knowledge-enhanced vision-language model that uses retrieval-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art short-horizon trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, with significant improvements in accuracy and safety metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge for accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.

Method: Combines temporal frequency-spatial fusion video encoder with self-supervised learning and hard-negative mining, plus scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval for scene-aligned exemplars. Uses chain-of-thought prompts with planning constraints and triple-stage fine-tuning for spatial, motion, and planning alignment.

Result: Achieves 0.70m average L2 with 0.21% collision rate (NoAvg) and 0.31m average L2 with 0.07% collision rate (TemAvg) on nuScenes dataset. Top-2 retrieved exemplars provide best accuracy-safety trade-off with sub-millisecond retrieval latency.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented, chain-of-thought-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA is a training-free dual-agent system that enhances instance segmentation datasets through LLM-diffusion model collaboration and image-based data augmentation, achieving significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data due to labor-intensive annotation and class imbalances, and overcoming limitations of existing methods that lack deep collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models.

Method: Proposes a dual-agent system: 1) Text-Agent with Prompt Rethink mechanism for iterative prompt refinement through LLM-diffusion collaboration, 2) Image-Agent that generates new instances conditioned on training images to enrich data distribution. Both operate as independent automated workflows.

Result: Achieves +4.0 box AP and +3.3 mask AP improvement on LVIS 1.0 validation set compared to baseline. Outperforms DiverGen by +0.3 box AP and +0.1 mask AP, with notable gains in common categories (+0.7 box AP) and frequent categories (+0.5 mask AP).

Conclusion: InstaDA effectively addresses dataset limitations through collaborative LLM-diffusion integration and training data utilization, demonstrating significant performance improvements in instance segmentation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

*Chao Fan,Xibin Jia,Anqi Xiao,Hongyuan Yu,Zhenghan Yang,Dawei Yang,Hui Xu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPENet improves few-shot medical image segmentation by generating multi-level prototypes and using query-guided enhancement to handle intra-class variations and support-query discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods use single global prototypes, which overlook intra-class variations and struggle with substantial discrepancies between support and query images.

Method: Proposes Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet) with two modules: Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) for global and local prototypes, and Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE) to refine support prototypes using query image guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets show SPENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior performance.

Conclusion: SPENet effectively addresses intra-class variations and support-query discrepancies in few-shot medical image segmentation through multi-level prototype generation and query-guided enhancement.

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

### [17] [SOPSeg: Prompt-based Small Object Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03002)
*Chenhao Wang,Yingrui Ji,Yu Meng,Yunjian Zhang,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOPSeg is a prompt-based framework for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery that addresses SAM's limitations with coarse feature resolution through region-adaptive magnification and customized decoder with edge prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object instance segmentation in remote sensing is underexplored due to technical challenges and high annotation costs, and existing models like SAM perform poorly on small objects due to coarse feature resolution.

Method: Proposes SOPSeg framework with region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve fine details, customized decoder with edge prediction and progressive refinement, and novel prompting mechanism for oriented bounding boxes.

Result: SOPSeg outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and enables efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses small object segmentation challenges in remote sensing and includes release of both model and a comprehensive dataset based on SODA-A to support future research.

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

### [18] [Enhancing Robustness in Post-Processing Watermarking: An Ensemble Attack Network Using CNNs and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03006)
*Tzuhsuan Huang,Cheng Yu Yeo,Tsai-Ling Huang,Hong-Han Shuai,Wen-Huang Cheng,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an ensemble attack network approach to enhance robustness in post-processing deep watermarking, combining CNN and Transformer networks across spatial and frequency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-processing watermarking offers more flexibility than in-processing methods as it can be applied to outputs from any generative model without needing internal model access, and allows unique watermarks for individual images.

Method: The study enhances watermarking robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training, using various combinations of CNN and Transformer networks in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate their impact on robustness.

Result: Combining CNN-based attack in spatial domain with Transformer-based attack in frequency domain yields highest robustness. Evaluation on WAVES benchmark shows significant improvement - 18.743% increase for StegaStamp under Regeneration Attack.

Conclusion: The ensemble attack network approach significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining different network architectures across multiple domains for improved post-processing watermarking.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released
at:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark.

Motivation: To develop an automated system for generating clinically relevant image captions for ulcerative colitis that aligns with endoscopic reporting practices and improves diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Integrates ResNet embeddings, Grad-CAM heatmaps, and CBAM-enhanced attention with T5 decoder. Uses clinical metadata (MES score, vascular pattern, bleeding, etc.) as natural-language prompts to guide structured caption generation.

Result: Improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy compared to baseline methods, supporting reliable endoscopic reporting.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces interpretable, structured descriptions aligned with clinical practice while enhancing diagnostic classification performance for ulcerative colitis.

Abstract: We present a lesion-aware image captioning framework for ulcerative colitis
(UC). The model integrates ResNet embeddings, Grad-CAM heatmaps, and
CBAM-enhanced attention with a T5 decoder. Clinical metadata (MES score 0-3,
vascular pattern, bleeding, erythema, friability, ulceration) is injected as
natural-language prompts to guide caption generation. The system produces
structured, interpretable descriptions aligned with clinical practice and
provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting
reliable endoscopic reporting.

### [20] [Unveiling the Response of Large Vision-Language Models to Visually Absent Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03025)
*Sohee Kim,Soohyun Ryu,Joonhyung Park,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs often mistakenly treat text inputs as visual content. The paper identifies specific FFN neurons that detect visual absence and develops a method to refine outputs by reinterpreting prompts or replacing absent tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models frequently misinterpret text inputs as being part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. The researchers want to determine if LVLMs have internal mechanisms to detect when textual concepts lack visual evidence.

Method: Identified Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons in FFN layers that signal visual absence through distinctive activation patterns. Developed a detection module to classify input token grounding, and used this to refine outputs by reinterpreting prompts or replacing absent tokens during generation.

Result: The method effectively mitigates models' tendency to falsely presume visual presence of text input. The approach demonstrates generality across various LVLMs in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LVLMs possess internal capability to detect visual absence through specific FFN neurons. Leveraging these neurons enables systematic detection and correction of grounding errors, improving model performance across different LVLM architectures.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

*Kaicong Huang,Talha Azfar,Jack M. Reilly,Thomas Guggisberg,Ruimin Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch cross-modal framework that jointly models foreground and background information for person re-identification, using intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning to suppress background noise and enhance foreground attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either rely on costly manual annotations for image partitioning or focus only on foreground information while ignoring valuable background cues. Inspired by human perception where background elimination is crucial for target identification.

Method: End-to-end framework with dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction. Uses intra-semantic alignment to match visual and textual features of same semantics, and inter-semantic adversarial learning to penalize similarity between foreground and background features.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and generality, achieving results that match or surpass state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Background semantics are as important as foreground semantics in ReID. The proposed joint modeling of both domains with alignment and adversarial strategies effectively suppresses background noise and enhances attention to identity-relevant foreground cues.

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedLiteNet: A lightweight CNN-Transformer hybrid for accurate skin-lesion segmentation that combines hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face limitations: CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers have quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets that hinder their use on small medical datasets common in dermatology.

Method: A hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with: 1) Depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks for computation efficiency, 2) Bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit for information exchange between resolutions, 3) Boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen lesion contours.

Result: The approach achieves high precision segmentation through hierarchical feature extraction and multi-scale context aggregation while maintaining lightweight design suitable for small medical datasets.

Conclusion: MedLiteNet provides an effective solution for dermoscopic segmentation by addressing the limitations of both CNNs and Transformers, offering global context modeling with computational efficiency for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

### [23] [DCDB: Dynamic Conditional Dual Diffusion Bridge for Ill-posed Multi-Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03044)
*Chengjie Huang,Jiafeng Yan,Jing Li,Lu Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm for ill-posed multi-task image processing that decouples diffusion and condition generation, uses dynamic conditions with time-related information, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on dehazing and visible-infrared fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional diffusion models struggle with exploiting intrinsic task correlations in multi-task scenarios, especially for ill-posed tasks with limited training data. Traditional static condition control cannot adapt to dynamically evolving multi-task learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm that: 1) decouples diffusion and condition generation processes to avoid dependence on supervised data, 2) uses dynamic conditions generated by the same noise schedule to adjust statistical characteristics and embed time-related information, reducing network learning difficulty.

Result: Achieves best performance on multiple indicators for dehazing and visible-infrared fusion tasks on public datasets. Analysis shows superiority of dynamic conditions through attention weight changes and learning objective comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic conditional approach effectively addresses challenges in ill-posed multi-task scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and learning efficiency compared to traditional static condition methods in diffusion models.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla language has complex character structures with 50 distinct characters and many compound characters, requiring advanced recognition methods that can handle both basic and compound characters while avoiding vanishing gradient problems.

Method: Applied transfer learning with deep neural networks including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and MobileNet for end-to-end classification of all standard Bangla handwritten character formations using the Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset with 166,105 image samples across 84 classes.

Result: Achieved 99.82% accuracy on training data and 99.46% accuracy on test data, outperforming various state-of-the-art benchmarks for Bangla handwritten character classification.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning approach with multiple deep neural network architectures successfully classifies both basic and compound Bangla handwritten characters with exceptional accuracy, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound
characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten
characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network
techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105
Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used
for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training
data and 99.46% accuracy on test data. Comparisons with various
state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show
that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

TL;DR: ADA-GAN model combines GAN with external classifier to handle cursive handwritten characters using data augmentation with adversarially perturbed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten characters are challenging to classify due to their complex and cursive nature compared to simple characters, requiring more robust classification methods.

Method: Uses a generator network to create fake handwritten character images, augments training data with adversarially perturbed noise, and employs discriminator network with confidence thresholding.

Result: CNN accuracy decreases with character complexity, but ADA-GAN remains robust and effective for both cursive and complex characters.

Conclusion: ADA-GAN provides a more effective solution for classifying complex cursive handwritten characters compared to traditional CNNs.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

TL;DR: Cross-domain feature transfer using TRELLIS generative model improves intracranial aneurysm analysis tasks including classification, segmentation, and blood-flow prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial aneurysms are clinically significant but difficult to detect and model due to limited annotated 3D medical data.

Method: Leverage latent geometric embeddings from TRELLIS (generative model trained on non-medical 3D datasets) to replace conventional features, enhancing neural networks for three aneurysm analysis tasks.

Result: Strong gains in accuracy, F1-score, segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and 15% reduction in simulation error.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical applications.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative

*Shota Iwamatsu,Koichi Ito,Takafumi Aoki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a backdoor poisoning attack method that makes face anti-spoofing systems misclassify certain spoofing attacks as live by embedding imperceptible features from spoofed images into live images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks using photos, and existing deep learning-based detection methods require large training datasets that could be poisoned with malicious data, allowing specific attacks to bypass detection.

Method: A novel backdoor poisoning attack that extracts features from spoofing attack face images and embeds them into live face images without causing visible changes, creating poisoned training data that causes the model to misclassify certain spoofing attacks.

Result: Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method poses a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems by enabling certain attacks to bypass detection.

Conclusion: The research reveals a latent threat of backdoor poisoning in face anti-spoofing detection, showing that attackers can manipulate training data to create vulnerabilities that allow specific spoofing attacks to evade detection systems.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net is a novel time series change detection network that infers change areas from change moments, ensuring consistency between spatial and temporal change detection results through a three-step process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat change area detection and change moment identification as separate tasks, despite the intrinsic relationship where change area can be inferred from change moment. This paper aims to unify these tasks for better consistency.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Difference Extraction and Enhancement with lightweight encoder and boundary enhancement convolution, 2) Coarse Change Moment Extraction using spatiotemporal correlation analysis, 3) Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference using multiscale temporal CAM to weight change moments and infer change areas.

Result: The proposed CAIM-Net framework successfully infers change areas from change moments, maintaining consistency between spatial change detection and temporal analysis results.

Conclusion: CAIM-Net provides an effective unified framework for time series change detection that leverages the intrinsic relationship between change moments and change areas, offering improved consistency compared to treating these as separate tasks.

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

### [29] [Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113)
*Shan Wang,Maying Shen,Nadine Chang,Chuong Nguyen,Hongdong Li,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a gradient-based self-reflection method to estimate token influence and detect visual tokens, then integrates this into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to reduce hallucinations in multimodal LLMs without additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucinations caused by text-visual bias (over-reliance on text) and co-occurrence bias (statistical object-pairing patterns) in multimodal LLMs, as existing methods don't account for fluctuating bias levels across instances.

Method: Uses gradient-based self-reflection to estimate influence of different token types (visual, prompt, previous outputs), detects object-related visual tokens, and integrates this into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework.

Result: Effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90 benchmark in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates both text-visual and co-occurrence biases simultaneously without requiring costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

*Miao Xu,Xiangyu Zhu,Xusheng Liang,Zidu Wang,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GravityDB: A diffusion-based method that formulates hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process to generate physically plausible interactions without interpenetration, with stable grasping, and realistic hand deformations, guided by textual semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand-object pose estimation methods produce coarse interactions with issues like interpenetration, gaps in contact regions, and inability to capture realistic hand deformations during interaction.

Method: Proposes Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) that simulates interactions between deformable hand surfaces and rigid objects as an attraction-driven process, incorporating semantic information from textual descriptions to guide gravitational field construction.

Result: Effectively resolves interpenetration issues, ensures stable grasping, captures realistic hand deformations, and enables semantically meaningful interaction regions. Validated through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GravityDB method successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by generating physically plausible hand-object interactions with improved realism and semantic guidance.

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

*Mattia Litrico,Francesco Guarnera,Mario Valerio Giuffrida,Daniele Ravì,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TADM-3D is a 3D diffusion model that predicts future brain MRI progression using a Brain-Age Estimator and bidirectional training to improve temporal accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRI prediction methods have limitations: they fail to capture structural-time relationships, rely on interpolation without clinical utility, and use 2D architectures that ignore 3D anatomical context needed for accurate longitudinal predictions.

Method: Proposed TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator to guide MRI generation reflecting expected age differences, and implements Back-In-Time Regularisation by training bidirectionally (forward to follow-up and backward to baseline) to improve temporal accuracy.

Result: The model was trained and evaluated on OASIS-3 dataset and validated for generalization on external NACC dataset.

Conclusion: TADM-3D provides a clinically useful approach for predicting future brain MRI progression by addressing temporal relationship modeling and full 3D context, with code availability upon acceptance.

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

*Karol Szustakowski,Luk Frank,Julia Esser,Jan Gründemann,Marie Piraud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel loss functions (Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss) for CNNs that preserve connectivity in biomedical segmentation, particularly for elongated structures like axons, reducing discontinuities and improving length accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In biomedical segmentation tasks, preserving elongated structure continuity and length is more critical than voxel-wise accuracy, especially for structures prone to discontinuity like axon initial segments with signal dropout.

Method: Proposed two novel loss functions applied to CNNs: Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss, combined with experiment design optimizations like downscaling and spacing correction to maintain continuous segmentation masks.

Result: The approach significantly reduces segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing input signal, leading to improved instance length calculation compared to standard CNNs and existing topology-aware losses.

Conclusion: Structural priors embedded in loss design can significantly enhance segmentation reliability for biological applications, demonstrating the importance of connectivity preservation over pure voxel accuracy.

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

### [33] [Count2Density: Crowd Density Estimation without Location-level Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03170)
*Mattia Litrico,Feng Chen,Michael Pound,Sotirios A Tsaftaris,Sebastiano Battiato,Mario Valerio Giuffrida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Count2Density is a novel pipeline that generates density maps using only count-level annotations instead of detailed point-level annotations, reducing annotation burden while maintaining spatial accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crowd density estimation requires tedious point-level annotations for each individual, which is time-consuming and limits scalability for real-world applications. The goal is to reduce annotation burden while maintaining accurate spatial information.

Method: Uses a Historical Map Bank initialized with unsupervised saliency estimation, updated with EMA of predictions. Generates pseudo-density maps by sampling from estimated crowd areas using hypergeometric distribution based on count annotations. Adds self-supervised contrastive spatial regularizer to enhance spatial awareness.

Result: Significantly outperforms cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across multiple datasets. Effectively retrieves spatial information from count-level annotations and enables accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: Count2Density successfully reduces annotation burden while maintaining spatial accuracy, providing a scalable solution for crowd density estimation with only count-level supervision during training.

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

*Alma M. Liezenga,Stefan Wijnja,Puck de Haan,Niels W. T. Brink,Jip J. van Stijn,Yori Kamphuis,Klamer Schutte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates poisoning attacks on military object detectors, creates a military vehicle dataset, tests a modified BadDet attack, finds high poisoning requirements, and proposes AutoDetect - a lightweight autoencoder-based detection method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poisoning attacks pose serious threats to military AI systems, but there's limited research on object detection poisoning, especially in military contexts where consequences can be grave.

Method: Created MilCivVeh military vehicle dataset, implemented modified BadDet patch-based poisoning attack, tested specialized poisoning detection and anomaly detection methods, then developed AutoDetect - an autoencoder-based method using reconstruction error of image slices.

Result: Poisoning attacks require substantial data poisoning to achieve success, raising practical applicability questions. AutoDetect outperforms existing methods in separating clean from poisoned samples while being less time- and memory-intensive.

Conclusion: Large representative military datasets are needed to further evaluate poisoning risks. AutoDetect shows promise for practical patch detection, but current detection methods are generally lacking for military object detection systems.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Motivation: Low-dose CT imaging reduces radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise and reduced image quality. Traditional denoising methods often fail to preserve image quality, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based approach with encoder-decoder architecture using PPO algorithm to optimize denoising policies in real-time based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 41.87, SSIM of 0.9814, and RMSE of 0.00236 on low-dose CT datasets. On NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic dataset: PSNR 41.52, SSIM 0.9723, RMSE 0.0051. Improved COVID-19 classification accuracy to 94% (4% improvement over non-RL methods).

Conclusion: The method provides a promising solution for safer and more accurate low-dose CT imaging, demonstrating superior performance over traditional denoising techniques and other deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

TL;DR: RTGMFF is a novel fMRI analysis framework that combines automatic text generation from ROI data with multimodal feature fusion, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy for brain disorders compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI analysis faces challenges with low signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, limited frequency awareness in CNN/Transformer models, and lack of textual annotations to contextualize brain activation patterns.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) ROI-driven fMRI text generation converting activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; 2) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder combining wavelet-mamba branch with cross-scale Transformer; 3) Adaptive semantic alignment module embedding ROI tokens and visual features in shared space with regularized cosine-similarity loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy with notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

Conclusion: RTGMFF effectively addresses limitations of current fMRI analysis by unifying text generation with multimodal feature fusion, demonstrating superior performance in brain disorder diagnosis and providing a reproducible framework for clinical applications.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynBT is a 3D medical diffusion model that generates high-quality synthetic breast tumors in MRI images using a patch-to-volume autoencoder and mask-conditioned diffusion, improving tumor segmentation performance by 2-3% Dice Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tumor synthesis methods perform poorly with large spatial volumes like breast tumors in MRI with large field-of-view, as current methods are based on small patches and yield suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes a 3D medical diffusion model with patch-to-volume autoencoder to compress high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space while preserving resolution, then uses mask-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize realistic breast tumors in selected tissue regions.

Result: The method demonstrated performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score for tumor segmentation tasks on a large public dataset, showing high-quality tumor synthesis capabilities.

Conclusion: SynBT provides realistic tumor appearances and facilitates improved segmentation performance, offering significant benefits for breast tumor segmentation in MRI images.

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

TL;DR: PointAD+ transfers CLIP's 2D capabilities to 3D anomaly detection using hierarchical representation learning with implicit (rendering pixel) and explicit (spatial geometry) anomaly semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics.

Method: Proposes PointAD+ framework with hierarchical representation learning: implicit 3D representation through point-pixel correspondence, explicit 3D representation using G-aggregation for spatial awareness, and cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment between rendering and geometry layers.

Result: Achieves superior performance in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with diverse class semantics, enabling holistic understanding of abnormality.

Conclusion: PointAD+ successfully bridges 2D and 3D anomaly detection by integrating both rendering pixel information and spatial geometry relationships, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities for unseen objects.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB

TL;DR: Long Chain-of-Thought data significantly improves reasoning in lightweight multimodal language models (under 7B parameters) through supervised fine-tuning, with additional gains from subsequent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether verifiable reward-based reinforcement learning, which works well for large LLMs, is effective for smaller multimodal language models and to explore the role of long Chain-of-Thought data in enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long Chain-of-Thought data followed by a reinforcement learning stage to enhance reasoning abilities of lightweight MLLMs with fewer than 7 billion parameters.

Result: SFT with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning, and subsequent RL stage provides additional performance gains, showing this approach is effective for lightweight models.

Conclusion: A supervised fine-tuning stage with long Chain-of-Thought data is a critical prerequisite for developing reasoning capabilities in lightweight multimodal language models.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astrocytes' altered morphology and density are hallmarks of neurological disorders, but their intricate branching and stain variability make automated detection challenging.

Method: Proposed a hybrid CNN-Transformer detector combining local feature extraction with global contextual reasoning, featuring heatmap guided query mechanism for small/faint astrocytes and lightweight Transformer module for dense clusters.

Result: Model consistently outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR on ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained datasets, achieving higher sensitivity with fewer false positives as confirmed by FROC analysis.

Conclusion: Hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures show strong potential for robust astrocyte detection and provide foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte

*Yixiong Jing,Cheng Zhang,Haibing Wu,Guangming Wang,Olaf Wysocki,Brian Sheil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion is a zero-shot framework that enhances masonry point clouds by projecting them into depth maps and restoring them using diffusion models, enabling improved brick-level segmentation without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brick-level segmentation methods rely on high-resolution RGB images which are impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds are robust to lighting but are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation capabilities.

Method: The framework projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM) without task-specific training. The enhanced depth maps are then used with Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation.

Result: Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation, demonstrating enhanced visual clarity and geometric consistency of the processed depth maps.

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion provides an effective zero-shot solution for automated inspection of masonry assets in challenging low-light environments, offering improved segmentation performance without requiring specialized training.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: T-CAGU is a novel hyperspectral unmixing framework that combines transformer for global dependencies and content-adaptive graph neural network for local relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deep learning methods for hyperspectral unmixing fail to simultaneously capture global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details in remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes a transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework that uses transformer to capture global dependencies and a content-adaptive graph neural network with multiple propagation orders to enhance local relationships. Includes graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods, showing robustness against noise and improved performance in hyperspectral unmixing tasks.

Conclusion: T-CAGU effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by integrating global and local feature learning, providing a robust solution for hyperspectral unmixing with both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GPTScore is a new evaluation method that uses MLLMs to decompose concept customization evaluation into finer aspects, achieving better alignment with human preferences than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for concept customization are either too narrow or too generalized, causing misalignment with human judgment, especially for complex multi-concept scenarios.

Method: Proposes Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore) that breaks down evaluation criteria into finer aspects and uses Multimodal Large Language Models for aspect-wise assessment. Also releases CC-AlignBench benchmark for single- and multi-concept tasks.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches on the benchmark, showing higher correlation with human preferences in evaluating concept customization.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for concept customization evaluation and identifies key challenges for future research, with benchmark and materials publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable multimodal framework for breast cancer subtyping that integrates CNV, clinical records, and histopathology images using a novel dual-based WSI representation and fusion strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare applications benefit from multimodal data integration, but available modalities vary across clinical settings. Breast cancer molecular subtyping is crucial for personalized treatment and improved prognosis.

Method: Proposed a loosely-coupled multimodal framework with dual-based WSI representation (combining image-based and graph-based approaches) and a new multimodal fusion strategy that can accommodate additional modalities without retraining.

Result: Significant performance improvements in breast cancer subtyping, outperforming state-of-the-art methods when integrating dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, flexible for various cancer types, and demonstrates that multimodal integration with the proposed dual WSI representation and fusion strategy enhances breast cancer subtyping performance.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

### [49] [Time-Scaling State-Space Models for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03426)
*AJ Piergiovanni,Ganesh Satish Mallya,Dahun Kim,Anelia Angelova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes State-Space Models with Transfer State to enable online dense video captioning by scaling SSMs for longer sequences, reducing computational costs by 7x FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense video captioning methods struggle with long videos due to computational complexity and memory limitations, and require full video input which prevents online processing.

Method: Time-scaling State-Space Models (SSMs) with Transfer State mechanism that combines long-sequence and recurrent properties, allowing SSMs to sustain state for longer contexts and enabling online processing.

Result: The approach scales well with video lengths, uses 7x fewer FLOPs, and enables on-the-fly caption generation without waiting for full video processing.

Conclusion: The proposed State-Space Models with Transfer State effectively address computational and memory limitations for long videos, making online dense video captioning practical and efficient.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework integrating EEG, image, and text data to decode visual neural representations from low SNR EEG signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ThingsEEG dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals by leveraging text modality to enhance semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.

Method: Proposes adapter module for cross-modal feature alignment, Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy for modality weighting, and stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) with dynamic Gaussian noise for generalization.

Result: Achieves 2.0% improvement in Top-1 accuracy and 4.7% improvement in Top-5 accuracy on ThingsEEG dataset compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The integration of text modality with EEG and image data significantly enhances neural representation decoding performance through improved semantic alignment and balanced multimodal feature contributions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

### [51] [Joint Training of Image Generator and Detector for Road Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03465)
*Kuan-Chuan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JTGD is a lightweight road defect detection method that jointly trains generator and detector without ensemble or TTA, achieving state-of-the-art performance with <20% parameters of baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road defect detection is crucial for vehicle safety, but existing methods require ensemble techniques and test-time augmentation that are computationally expensive for edge devices with limited resources.

Method: Proposes JTGD that jointly trains image generator and detector with dual discriminators to enforce plausible synthesized defect patches and images. Uses CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance loss to improve image quality and synthesizes harder examples for detector training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RDD2022 benchmark across various countries without ensemble or TTA. Uses less than 20% parameters compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: JTGD provides an efficient solution for road defect detection that is suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Conclusion: First work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, demonstrating efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks with minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized

these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on

Result: Significantly outperforms existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding, with drastic reduction in decoding steps compared to diffusion methods.

Conclusion: Pure autoregressive modeling serves as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence, demonstrating powerful potential for efficient multimodal integration.

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only

TL;DR: Strefer is a synthetic instruction data generation framework that enhances Video LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities without proprietary models or human annotation, achieving superior performance on spatial and temporal disambiguation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning, particularly in resolving spatial and temporal references needed for real-world AI companions that must understand gestural cues and time-based event references.

Method: Strefer uses a data engine to pseudo-annotate temporally dense video metadata, generating diverse instruction-tuning data with structured spatial information (subjects, objects, locations as masklets) and temporal information (action descriptions and timelines).

Result: Models trained with Strefer-generated data outperform baselines on spatial and temporal disambiguation tasks and exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Strefer establishes a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs by enabling fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning without costly human annotation or proprietary models.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: To investigate whether handwriting has a genetic component and is inherited, and to understand how family relationships affect handwriting styles - addressing questions that lack available research databases.

Method: Collected handwritten samples (digits, letters, shapes, free paragraphs) from 210 families including multiple generations and relatives using specially designed forms, capturing family relationships of all writers.

Result: Similarities in handwriting features and writing styles were detected among family members through comparisons and feature analysis.

Conclusion: The database is freely available to the pattern recognition community and aims to enable further research on inheritance and family relationship effects on handwriting.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation

handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks have limitations in evaluating both composition and reasoning capabilities, particularly lacking complexity in high-density scenes and multi-step reasoning that reflects real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed a 12-dimensional taxonomy structuring composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, relation) and reasoning around inference types (deductive, inductive, abductive). Created 1,080 prompts with high compositional density and multi-step inference, each paired with a checklist of ~13,500 yes/no questions for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 27 T2I models revealed limited composition capability in complex high-density scenarios and even poorer reasoning performance, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

Conclusion: Current T2I models face significant challenges in both composition and reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios, highlighting reasoning as a critical bottleneck that needs further research and development.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.
