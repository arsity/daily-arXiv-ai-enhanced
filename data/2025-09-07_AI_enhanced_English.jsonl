In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport.

Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates.

While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval.
