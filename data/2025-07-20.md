### [1] [Spatially Grounded Explanations in Vision Language Models for Document Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12490)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Héctor Cerezo-Costas,Dimosthenis Karatzas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EaGERS is a training-free pipeline that improves document visual question answering by generating natural language rationales, grounding them to spatial regions, and restricting response generation to relevant masked areas, achieving better accuracy and transparency without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance transparency and reproducibility in Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) while improving performance without requiring additional model fine-tuning or training.

Method: EaGERS employs a three-step pipeline: (1) generates natural language rationales using a vision language model, (2) grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3) restricts response generation to only the relevant regions in the masked image.

Result: On the DocVQA dataset, EaGERS outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics while being fully training-free and model-agnostic.

Conclusion: EaGERS successfully demonstrates that a training-free approach can simultaneously improve DocVQA performance and enhance model transparency and reproducibility without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

### [2] [MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12508)
*Yuncong Yang,Jiageng Liu,Zheyuan Zhang,Siyuan Zhou,Reuben Tan,Jianwei Yang,Yilun Du,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney enhances VLMs' 3D reasoning by coupling them with a controllable world model, improving performance on spatial reasoning tasks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack 3D spatial reasoning capabilities, limiting their performance in tasks like navigation and manipulation.

Method: Couples a VLM with a video diffusion-based world model to iteratively explore and synthesize multi-view scenes for reasoning.

Result: Achieves an average 8% performance boost on the SAT benchmark and outperforms reinforcement learning-trained VLMs.

Conclusion: MindJourney offers a simple, plug-and-play solution for robust 3D reasoning by leveraging world models.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

*Gen Luo,Wenhan Dou,Wenhao Li,Zhaokai Wang,Xue Yang,Changyao Tian,Hao Li,Weiyun Wang,Wenhai Wang,Xizhou Zhu,Yu Qiao,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5, monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) addressing optimization and forgetting issues via delta tuning and a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. EViP and EViP++ enhance visual capabilities, with Mono-InternVL-1.5 reducing costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolithic MLLMs face unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. The goal is to improve stability and efficiency in learning visual knowledge.

Method: Embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM using delta tuning. Introduce Mono-InternVL with a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture and EViP for progressive learning. Mono-InternVL-1.5 improves efficiency with EViP++ and a fused CUDA kernel.

Result: Mono-InternVL outperforms existing MLLMs on 12/15 benchmarks (e.g., +114-point improvement on OCRBench). Mono-InternVL-1.5 reduces costs and latency (up to 69%) while matching modular counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed monolithic MLLMs, Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5, achieve competitive performance with improved stability and efficiency, validated across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

### [4] [Best Practices for Large-Scale, Pixel-Wise Crop Mapping and Transfer Learning Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12590)
*Judy Long,Tao Liu,Sean Alexander Woznicki,Miljana Marković,Oskar Marko,Molly Sears*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study reviews large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, comparing supervised and transfer learning methods. It identifies optimal preprocessing and models, emphasizing the role of sample size and domain shift in workflow choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best practices for crop mapping by evaluating supervised and transfer learning workflows, considering preprocessing methods, model performance, and sample size impact.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing six preprocessing methods, eleven supervised classification models, and transfer learning techniques across five agricultural sites using Landsat 8 data.

Result: Fine-scale preprocessing with Transformer models performed best. RF was efficient for supervised learning. Transfer learning improved adaptability, with UDA for homogeneous classes and fine-tuning for diverse scenarios. Workflow choice depends on labeled sample availability.

Conclusion: Supervised training excels with sufficient samples, while transfer learning is viable for limited data. Optimal workflows depend on domain shift and sample size.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CT-ScanGaze, the first public eye-tracking dataset for CT, and CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor for radiologists' gaze patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretable computer-aided diagnosis systems by understanding radiologists' eye movements during CT reading, addressing the lack of public datasets and 3D complexity.

Method: Developed CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor, and a pipeline to convert 2D gaze data to 3D for pretraining.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative evaluations on CT-ScanGaze.

Conclusion: The approach provides a framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical imaging, enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

### [6] [MS-DGCNN++: A Multi-Scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Biological Knowledge Integration for LiDAR Tree Species Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12602)
*Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Hanaa El Afia,Raddouane Chiheb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++ improves tree species classification by hierarchically fusing multi-scale features, outperforming existing methods with higher accuracy and lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-scale approaches fail to capture semantic relationships in tree structures, limiting classification accuracy.

Method: MS-DGCNN++ uses hierarchical multi-scale fusion with scale-specific feature engineering (local, branch, canopy) and cross-scale propagation.

Result: Achieves 94.96% accuracy on STPCTLS, 67.25% on FOR-species20K, and outperforms DGCNN/MS-DGCNN on ModelNet40/10.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, efficient, and generalizes well to 3D object recognition, offering a resource-friendly solution.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

### [7] [Predicting Soccer Penalty Kick Direction Using Human Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12617)
*David Freire-Obregón,Oliverio J. Santana,Javier Lorenzo-Navarro,Daniel Hernández-Sosa,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel soccer penalty kick dataset is introduced for predicting shot direction using pre-kick movements, with a deep learning model achieving 63.9% accuracy, outperforming goalkeepers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated datasets for real-world sports scenarios, particularly for action anticipation in HAR, prompted the creation of a specialized soccer penalty kick dataset.

Method: A deep learning classifier integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with contextual metadata, evaluated across 22 backbone models from 7 architecture families.

Result: The model achieved 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left/right), surpassing real goalkeepers' performance.

Conclusion: The dataset and model show promise for anticipatory action recognition and generalizability in sports-based predictive tasks.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

### [8] [Funnel-HOI: Top-Down Perception for Zero-Shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12628)
*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Funnel-HOI introduces a top-down framework for human-object interaction detection, leveraging object and action cues at the encoder stage with an asymmetric co-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the long-tail distribution problem in HOID by focusing on encoder-level HOI-specific cues for stronger scene interpretation, inspired by human cognition.

Method: Proposes Funnel-HOI, a top-down framework probing objects first, then actions, using asymmetric co-attention and a novel loss function for better interaction classification.

Result: Achieves up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI's encoder-level focus and novel loss function significantly improve HOID performance, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

### [9] [Reconstruct, Inpaint, Finetune: Dynamic Novel-view Synthesis from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12646)
*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method (CogNVS) for dynamic scene novel-view synthesis from monocular videos, combining 3D reconstruction and 2D video diffusion, outperforming prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of prior methods (costly optimization or poor geometry preservation) for dynamic scene novel-view synthesis.

Method: Uses 3D scene reconstruction for covisible pixels and a self-supervised 2D video diffusion model (CogNVS) for hidden pixels, enabling zero-shot application.

Result: CogNVS outperforms most prior methods in dynamic scene novel-view synthesis.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines 3D reconstruction and diffusion models, achieving superior performance with minimal test-time optimization.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

### [10] [Integrated Oculomics and Lipidomics Reveal Microvascular Metabolic Signatures Associated with Cardiovascular Health in a Healthy Cohort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12663)
*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study integrates retinal microvasculature traits with serum lipidomic data to identify early CVD biomarkers, revealing strong correlations between vascular features and specific lipid classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVD risk stratification lacks early detection methods. This study aims to bridge the gap by combining retinal imaging and lipidomics for better biomarkers.

Method: Used deep learning for retinal image analysis and UHPLC ESI HRMS for lipid profiling in a healthy population, adjusting for covariates.

Result: Found age- and sex-independent correlations between retinal vascular traits (e.g., artery width, vessel density) and lipid subclasses (TAGs, DAGs, Cers).

Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into early CVD pathogenesis and potential non-invasive biomarkers for improved detection and prevention.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Result: 91% parameter reduction, 91% computational complexity reduction, 3x inference speed improvement, and state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1-score: 0.771, mean IoU: 0.677).

Conclusion: FORTRESS is a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a

efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuraLeaf is a neural parametric model for 3D leaves, addressing challenges in plant modeling by disentangling 2D base shapes and 3D deformations, leveraging 2D datasets and a novel skeleton-free skinning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant leaves' diverse shapes and flexible deformation pose unique challenges, unlike humans or animals, necessitating a specialized neural parametric model.

Method: NeuraLeaf separates leaf geometry into 2D base shapes and 3D deformations, using a skeleton-free skinning model and a new 3D leaf dataset (DeformLeaf).

Result: NeuraLeaf accurately generates diverse leaf shapes with deformation, fitting well to 3D observations like depth maps and point clouds.

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf effectively models 3D leaves, offering a robust solution for agriculture and computer graphics, with publicly available implementation and dataset.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving semantic-segmentation method using perceptual encryption for training and test images, achieving near-identical accuracy to non-encrypted models via Vision Transformer domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy in semantic segmentation by encrypting images while maintaining high accuracy.

*Wangzheng Shi,Yinglin Zheng,Yuxin Lin,Jianmin Bao,Ming Zeng,Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairShifter introduces a novel framework for video-based hair transfer, combining high-quality image transfer with temporal coherence, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based hair transfer is challenging due to temporal consistency and spatial fidelity needs, which current methods struggle with.

Method: HairShifter uses an 'Anchor Frame + Animation' framework with an Image Hair Transfer module and Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder for seamless blending and coherence.

Result: The method achieves superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability in video hairstyle transfer.

Conclusion: HairShifter sets a robust baseline for video hairstyle transfer and opens new research avenues.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mamba Snake, a deep snake framework with state space modeling, improves UMIS by addressing multi-scale structural heterogeneity and inter-organ relationships, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3% Dice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMIS faces challenges due to multi-scale structural heterogeneity and lack of object-level anatomical insight in conventional methods.

Method: Proposes Mamba Snake, a deep snake framework with hierarchical state space atlas, Mamba Evolution Block (MEB), energy map shape priors, and dual-classification synergy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3% Dice across five clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake effectively addresses UMIS challenges, offering robust performance and improved segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [19] [Think-Before-Draw: Decomposing Emotion Semantics & Fine-Grained Controllable Expressive Talking Head Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12761)
*Hanlei Shi,Leyuan Qu,Yu Liu,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Think-Before-Draw framework for text-driven emotional talking-head generation, addressing oversimplified emotion labels and enhancing natural expressiveness through semantic parsing and fine-grained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven methods for emotional talking-head generation rely on predefined emotion labels, which oversimplify real facial dynamics and lack natural expressiveness.

Method: Proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework: (1) uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to transform emotion labels into physiologically grounded descriptions, and (2) employs a progressive guidance denoising strategy for fine-grained expressiveness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (MEAD, HDTF) and demonstrates zero-shot generation capability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between high-level emotion semantics and realistic facial dynamics, improving emotional talking-head generation.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining generative scene augmentation and adaptive temporal reasoning improves traffic accident anticipation in autonomous driving by addressing data scarcity and missing cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable accident anticipation in autonomous driving is hindered by limited training data and missing object-level cues due to environmental or sensor issues.

Method: Proposes a video generation pipeline for diverse driving scenarios and a dynamic prediction model with graph convolutions and temporal operators. Also releases a new benchmark dataset.

Result: The framework enhances accuracy and lead time in accident anticipation, validated on public and new datasets.

Conclusion: The solution robustly addresses data and modeling challenges in safety-critical autonomous driving.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Result: Achieved 81.9% tracking success rate on 5,200 frames, with 82.9% target coverage during UAV handoffs.

Conclusion: The system is viable for scalable, autonomous marine monitoring, demonstrating robustness to environmental challenges.

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATARA and AnyPos to address limitations of VLA models by decoupling action execution from task-specific conditioning, improving scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on task-specific human demonstrations in VLA models limits generalization and incurs high costs.

Method: Proposes ATARA for scalable self-supervised data collection and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoder.

Result: ATARA accelerates data collection by 30x, and AnyPos improves test accuracy by 51% and success rates by 30-40% in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The AnyPos-ATARA pipeline enhances scalability, efficiency, and performance in vision-language-action models for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReToM improves Stable Diffusion by merging tokens locally, balancing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of attention operations in Stable Diffusion without compromising image quality.

Method: Proposes ReToM, a token merging strategy using local windows and representative tokens based on similarity.

Result: Achieves 6.2% better FID and higher CLIP scores with comparable inference time.

Conclusion: ReToM effectively balances visual quality and computational efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate transformer blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision efficiently, reducing computational cost without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses differentiable channel selection in MLP layers of transformer blocks, guided by a novel theoretical generalization bound, to prune channels generalization-aware.

Result: KCR-Transformer reduces FLOPs while maintaining or improving accuracy, outperforming original models in vision tasks with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer is a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for vision transformers, compatible with popular architectures like ViT and Swin.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVM-City, a multidomain outdoor scene understanding dataset, and City-VLM, a model for multimodal fusion, addressing limitations of existing LVLMs in large-scale outdoor scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs are limited in outdoor scene understanding due to single-view, single-modal focus and lack of multidomain data.

Method: Developed SVM-City dataset (420k images, 4,811M point clouds, 567k QA pairs) and City-VLM model using incomplete multimodal learning and joint probabilistic distribution for fusion.

Result: City-VLM outperforms existing LVLMs by 18.14% in QA tasks, showing strong generalization across outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: SVM-City and City-VLM effectively address outdoor scene understanding challenges, offering improved performance and scalability.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document quality assessment methods lack accuracy and robustness, limiting practical use. MLLMs show promise in image quality assessment, inspiring their adaptation for documents.

Method: DeQA-Doc leverages MLLMs' visual language capabilities and a soft label strategy. It adapts DeQA-Score by constructing soft labels, relaxing resolution constraints, and using ensemble methods.

Result: DeQA-Doc significantly outperforms existing baselines, providing accurate and generalizable quality scores across diverse document degradation types.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc successfully extends MLLM-based quality assessment to documents, offering a robust and accurate solution.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

*Yufei Peng,Yonggang Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sage, a method for long-tailed visual recognition by integrating semantic guidance from text into visual fine-tuning, addressing class imbalance and prediction bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed scenarios degrade performance in less frequent classes. Foundation models offer potential, but current fine-tuning methods overlook visual-textual alignment and class distribution inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces Sage with an SG-Adapter to integrate class descriptions as semantic guidance via attention, and a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor to rectify prediction bias.

Result: Experiments show Sage effectively enhances performance in long-tailed learning by improving alignment and addressing bias.

Conclusion: Sage successfully integrates semantic guidance and rectifies prediction bias, demonstrating strong performance in long-tailed visual recognition.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIQ, a novel approach for Video Question Answering (VQA) that generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions to enhance model reasoning and generalization by capturing broader context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods rely on event-centric Q&A pairs, missing broader context like object types and spatial layouts, limiting generalization and reasoning.

Method: FIQ generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions and integrates a VQ-CAlign module to align question embeddings with visual features.

Result: FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on SUTD-TrafficQA, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FIQ improves VQA by enriching training data with fundamental scene information and aligning embeddings, enhancing reasoning and generalization.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

### [31] [FAR-Net: Multi-Stage Fusion Network with Enhanced Semantic Alignment and Adaptive Reconciliation for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12823)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-Net is a multi-stage fusion framework for composed image retrieval (CIR) that combines late and early fusion to improve semantic alignment and robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods either focus too much on text (early fusion) or struggle with fine-grained alignment (late fusion). FAR-Net aims to address these limitations.

Method: FAR-Net integrates two modules: ESAM (late fusion with cross-attention for fine-grained alignment) and ARM (early fusion with uncertainty embeddings for robustness).

Result: Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show improvements: Recall@1 by 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FAR-Net provides a robust and scalable solution for CIR tasks, balancing semantic alignment and adaptability.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of tracking small objects in UAV videos where detection and appearance-based association are unreliable due to minimal pixel occupancy.

Method: The SMOT4SB dataset with 211 UAV sequences and 108,192 annotated frames is introduced, along with the SO-HOTA metric combining Dot Distance and HOTA for better evaluation.

Result: A competitive challenge saw a 5.1x improvement over the baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and metric.

Conclusion: This work advances SMOT in UAV scenarios, with potential applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets
occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

TL;DR: The AnyCap Project introduces a lightweight plug-and-play framework (ACM) for controllable captioning, a dataset (ACD), and a benchmark (AnyCapEval) to improve fine-grained control and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation for controllable captioning.

Method: ACM enhances controllability of foundation models without retraining, using original captions, user instructions, and modality features. ACD provides diverse data, and AnyCapEval offers better evaluation metrics.

Result: ACM improves caption quality significantly, e.g., boosting GPT-4o's content scores by 45% and style scores by 12%.

Conclusion: The AnyCap Project effectively addresses gaps in controllable captioning with a comprehensive solution.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image captioning aids in interpreting complex satellite imagery for applications like environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based architecture with Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, and Mesh Transformer techniques.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art systems on UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for real-life remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to
present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image

*Ziyi Wang,Zhi Gao,Jin Chen,Qingjie Zhao,Xinxiao Wu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRE, an attention-refocusing scheme for domain generalization using CLIP, improving performance on unseen domains by aligning attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with focusing on domain-invariant regions, leading to suboptimal generalization.

Method: SRE simulates domain shifts, refocuses attention in CLIP, and uses ensemble learning to align attention maps.

Result: SRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SRE effectively reduces domain shift and enhances generalization by aligning attention in CLIP.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCORE, an open-vocabulary framework for remote sensing instance segmentation, addressing challenges like diverse landscapes and small objects by integrating multi-granularity scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing instance segmentation methods are limited to close-vocabulary prediction, hindering their ability to recognize novel categories or generalize across datasets, which restricts their use in diverse Earth observation scenarios.

Method: The proposed SCORE framework integrates regional and global context to enhance visual and textual representations. It includes Region-Aware Integration for refining class embeddings and Global Context Adaptation for enriching text embeddings.

Result: SCORE achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SCORE provides a robust solution for large-scale geospatial analysis, demonstrating superior performance in handling diverse remote sensing challenges.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual methods struggle with poor lighting, occlusion, and angles, prompting the use of Wi-Fi signals for more reliable identification.

Method: Extracts biometric features from CSI, processes them through a Transformer-based DNN, and trains with in-batch negative loss.

Result: Competitive performance on the NTU-Fi dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WhoFi effectively identifies individuals using Wi-Fi signals, overcoming limitations of visual methods.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance.
While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting,
occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these
challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals
for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel
State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network
(DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an
in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric
signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves
competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its
effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Xiaoshuai Sun,Shuting He,Jiayi Ji,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRSeg is a model for high-resolution reasoning segmentation, addressing low perceptual resolution in existing methods with HRP and HRE modules for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning segmentation suffer from low perceptual resolution due to pre-trained visual encoders at lower resolutions, and interpolation methods are inefficient.

Method: HRSeg introduces High-Resolution Perception (HRP) for multi-granularity feature integration and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) for fine-grained mask-text alignment.

Result: Ablation studies and benchmark experiments show HRSeg outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: HRSeg effectively enhances perceptual resolution and segmentation precision, validated by superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

TL;DR: NeckSense is a wearable system using bio-impedance sensing for head pose tracking, achieving performance comparable to vision-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight, line-of-sight-free wearable for accurate head pose tracking using bio-impedance sensing.

Method: Multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft electrodes and a deep learning framework integrating anatomical priors.

Result: Mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm, validated on 7 participants with leave-one-person-out cross-validation.

Conclusion: NeckSense demonstrates that bio-impedance wearables can match vision-based methods in head-tracking performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel camera-based method for emotion recognition integrates gaze patterns with environmental context, overcoming limitations of traditional explicit and physiological signal-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion recognition methods rely on explicit signals or invasive sensors, which are limited in capturing deeper, implicit emotions and natural behavior.

Method: Uses standard HD cameras to unobtrusively capture gaze and head movements, analyzing spatial, semantic, and temporal dynamics of gaze behavior.

Result: The approach reveals emotions as outcomes of human-environment interactions, enabling real-time, continuous, and scalable recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a non-invasive, cost-effective solution for accurate and generalizable emotion recognition in natural settings.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LanePerf, a framework for estimating lane detection model performance without ground-truth labels, outperforming existing methods in robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in lane detection models reduce reliability in new environments, and collecting labeled data is costly. Performance estimation without labels is underexplored.

Method: Adapts five image classification methods to lane detection, then introduces LanePerf, integrating image and lane features using a pretrained encoder and DeepSets architecture.

Result: LanePerf achieves a lower MAE (0.117) and higher Spearman's correlation (0.727) on the OpenLane dataset, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: LanePerf enables robust, label-free performance estimation, enhancing ADAS testing efficiency and safety in diverse driving scenarios.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

TL;DR: A new dataset for Federated Learning (FL) is introduced, along with two novel algorithms (Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star), which outperform existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dedicated image classification datasets for FL and improve collaborative learning with privacy preservation.

Method: Proposes Fed-Cyclic (cyclic weight transfer) and Fed-Star (star-like topology with pre-aggregation) algorithms.

Result: Both algorithms show superior performance on the new dataset compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The dataset and algorithms advance FL research, offering improved privacy and performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AthleticsPose, a dataset for monocular 3D pose estimation in sports, showing improved accuracy over imitated datasets and highlighting practical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear reliability of monocular 3D pose estimation for sports tasks.

Method: Introduce the AthleticsPose dataset, train a 3D pose estimation model, and evaluate performance against a baseline.

Result: Model trained on AthleticsPose reduces MPJPE by ~75% compared to baseline, but accuracy varies with camera view and subject scale.

Conclusion: Authentic sports motion data is crucial for accurate pose estimation, though challenges remain for high-speed metrics. The dataset and findings aid future research.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Argus is a 3D multimodal framework combining multi-view images, text, and 3D point clouds to enhance 3D scene understanding with LLMs, addressing information loss in point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud methods suffer from information loss, especially for textureless planes or complex objects. Multi-view images can compensate for these gaps.

Method: Argus integrates multi-view images, camera poses, and 3D point clouds to create detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings, leveraging LLMs for 3D tasks.

Result: Argus outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in downstream tasks by compensating for reconstruction deficiencies.

Conclusion: Argus advances 3D scene understanding by combining multimodal inputs, improving LLM capabilities for 3D tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DMQ, combining Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to improve quantization in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational costs and performance degradation in diffusion models due to quantization, especially at low bit-widths.

Method: Uses LES to optimize channel-wise scaling and PTS for activations, with adaptive timestep weighting and a voting algorithm for reliable PTS factor selection.

Result: DMQ outperforms existing methods at low bit-widths (e.g., W4A6, W4A8), maintaining high image quality and stability.

Conclusion: DMQ effectively addresses quantization challenges in diffusion models, offering a robust solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic

in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised cross-modal person ReID method using single-modal labels, leveraging heterogeneous expert collaboration to improve cross-modal identity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of cross-modal labeled data in visible-infrared person ReID, enabling robust performance without explicit cross-modal labels.

Method: Proposes a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework, using single-modal experts to predict cross-modal identities and a fusion mechanism to integrate predictions.

Result: Validated on two datasets, the method enhances modality-invariant feature extraction and cross-modal recognition.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves cross-modal ReID performance in weakly supervised settings.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUPM, a multimodal uncertainty propagation model, to analyze uncertainties in MLLMs from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text inputs, demonstrating robustness and transferability in clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify uncertainties in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) arising from individual and joint modalities, and explore their clinical applications.

Method: Proposes MUPM, a model based on uncertainty propagation, tested on real clinical data (cardiac MR scans and health records) with few samples.

Result: MUPMs are robust, generalizable across data distributions and tasks, and enable practical clinical applications like uncertainty estimation and redundancy identification.

Conclusion: MUPMs offer efficient uncertainty analysis in MLLMs, with transferability and clinical utility, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoViC is a DiT-based framework for long, coherent video generation using FlexFormer, an autoencoder for unified video-text latent representations with linear scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scaling diffusion transformers (DiTs) for long-duration video generation without compromising temporal coherence or scalability.

Method: Uses FlexFormer, an autoencoder compressing video and text into unified latent representations with variable-length inputs and position-aware mechanisms.

Result: Effective generation of long, coherent videos, supporting diverse tasks like prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation.

Conclusion: LoViC offers a scalable and versatile solution for long-duration video generation with maintained coherence.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

TL;DR: cIDIR is a learning-based DIR framework using INRs to condition registration on regularization hyperparameters, avoiding retraining and enabling advanced regularization via differentiable DVFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning regularization parameters in DIR is computationally expensive, requiring multiple training iterations.

Method: Proposes cIDIR, a framework based on INRs, trained over a prior distribution of hyperparameters and optimized using segmentation masks. Models a continuous, differentiable DVF.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and robustness on the DIR-LAB dataset.

Conclusion: cIDIR efficiently handles regularization hyperparameters and integrates advanced techniques, improving DIR performance.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

*Qiang Wang,Mengchao Wang,Fan Jiang,Yaqi Fan,Yonggang Qi,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait is a diffusion transformer framework for high-fidelity, emotion-rich facial animations, addressing challenges in cross reenactment and multi-character scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using geometric priors often produce artifacts and struggle with subtle emotions or multi-character animation due to feature interference.

Method: The framework uses expression-augmented learning with implicit representations and a masked cross-attention mechanism for multi-character control.

Result: FantasyPortrait outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross reenactment and multi-character animation, validated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances facial animation by improving emotion capture and multi-character coordination, supported by new datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multifaceted approach to diagnose wrist pathologies using limited datasets by combining fine-grained recognition, metadata fusion, and fine-grained pre-training, improving accuracy by 2-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wrist pathologies are common but hard to diagnose due to time constraints and lack of expertise. Limited datasets in medical imaging make computer vision solutions challenging.

Method: Uses fine-grained recognition for subtle X-ray pathologies, fuses patient metadata with images, and employs fine-grained pre-training instead of coarse datasets like ImageNet.

Result: Fine-grained strategy and metadata integration boost diagnostic accuracy by 2% with limited data and over 10% with larger datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses wrist pathology diagnosis challenges, especially with limited data, by leveraging fine-grained techniques and metadata fusion.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

### [54] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images by leveraging pre-trained RGB latent diffusion models (RGB-LDMs) and introducing an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in estimating unobservable spectral features from RGB images, which lack full spectral information. The solution involves utilizing spatial knowledge from RGB models and focusing on spectral structure separately.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) spectral structure representation learning using a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE), and (2) spectral-spatial joint distribution learning by combining SpeUAE and spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) outputs into ULDM.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral reconstruction and downstream tasks like relighting.

Conclusion: The proposed ULDM effectively leverages RGB pre-trained models for spectral reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance by separating and modeling unobservable spectral features.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Variance-Based Pruning is a one-shot pruning technique that reduces model size and computational costs while maintaining high performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and memory demands of large models like Vision Transformers make deployment challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware. Existing pruning methods often require costly retraining.

Method: The approach gathers activation statistics to select neurons for pruning and integrates mean activations to preserve performance.

Result: On ImageNet-1k, DeiT-Base retains 70% performance post-pruning and regains 99% accuracy with 10 epochs of fine-tuning, reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning efficiently compresses models with minimal retraining, making deployment more feasible.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DISSect, a method for efficient sample selection in contrastive learning by leveraging differential information between model predictions to address noisy correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sample selection methods either rely on offline oracle models (limited in cold-start) or online predictions (inefficient for noisy correspondence), prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Proposes DISSect, which uses the differential between current and historical model predictions to characterize sample quality and enable robust selection.

Result: DISSect outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets across various tasks.

Conclusion: DISSect effectively addresses noisy correspondence and accelerates training, demonstrating consistent superiority in experiments.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces scribble annotation supervision for image manipulation localization (IML), proposing a new dataset (Sc-IML) and a weakly supervised framework with self-supervised training, feature modulation, and fusion modules to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations for IML, the study explores scribble annotation as a more efficient weak supervision method.

Method: The proposed framework includes self-supervised training with structural consistency loss, a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM), a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM), and a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss (L_CEM).

Result: The method outperforms fully supervised approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Scribble annotation supervision is effective for IML, and the proposed framework achieves superior performance with limited annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAR models underperform compared to AR models despite efficient parallel decoding. This study aims to refine MAR architecture for better image generation.

Method: Evaluated image tokenizers, introduced bidirectional attention and 2D RoPE in LLaMA architecture, scaled parameters, and developed text-driven and real-time variants.

Result: MaskGIL achieves FID 3.71 (matching AR models) with 8 inference steps vs. 256, and enables text-to-image and speech-to-image conversion.

Conclusion: MaskGIL advances MAR models, offering efficient, high-quality image generation and broader applications.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes, necessitating a method to enhance their performance.

Method: HCS progressively refines selected regions using a theoretically guaranteed importance function, focusing on utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy.

Result: HCS enables VLMs to rapidly understand unseen scenes at any scale with minimal interpretable regions, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HCS is a plug-and-play, universally compatible method that significantly advances VLMs in scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances dataset distillation by ensuring label accuracy and improving image quality.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Channel-wise Motion Features for efficient motion segmentation, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of existing motion segmentation models, which hinders real-time performance in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Introduces Channel-wise Motion Features, extracting depth features and 3D motion information using only a Pose Network, eliminating other subnetworks.

Result: Achieves 4x faster FPS than state-of-the-art models on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, with equivalent accuracy and 25% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB improves Open World Object Detection (OWOD) by resolving learning conflicts in PROB and introducing efficient feature extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of ground truths for unknown objects in OWOD tasks makes them challenging. PROB, a state-of-the-art model, faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.

Method: Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to resolve learning conflicts and Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI) for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Decoupled PROB outperforms existing methods on OWOD benchmarks, significantly improving performance.

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB addresses key limitations of PROB and enhances OWOD performance through novel techniques like ETOP and TDQI.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

*Han Zhang,Xiangde Luo,Yong Chen,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffOSeg is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for medical image segmentation that addresses annotation variability by achieving both consensus-driven and preference-driven segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and diverse expertise challenges traditional methods.

Method: DiffOSeg uses a two-stage approach: Stage I establishes probabilistic consensus, and Stage II captures expert-specific preferences via adaptive prompts.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170 datasets.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg effectively combines consensus and expert-specific segmentation, offering a comprehensive solution to annotation variability.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

*Yuqi Peng,Pengfei Wang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient) is a simpler, more general framework for prompt tuning in vision-language models, addressing overfitting in few-shot scenarios with gradient-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt tuning methods overfit in few-shot scenarios and rely on complex architectures, limiting general applicability.

Method: GLAD combines LoRA for parameter-efficient tuning with gradient-based regularization to stabilize optimization and improve robustness.

Result: GLAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 15 benchmark datasets in base-to-novel, domain, and cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: GLAD provides a robust, generalizable solution for prompt tuning, mitigating overfitting and simplifying the process.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

*Zhennan Xiao,Katharine Brudkiewicz,Zhen Yuan,Rosalind Aughwane,Magdalena Sokolska,Joanna Chappell,Trevor Gaunt,Anna L. David,Andrew P. King,Andrew Melbourne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for fetal lung maturity assessment using deep learning and IVIM analysis, showing comparable results to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation for fetal lung maturity assessment is time-consuming, limiting clinical use. Automation can improve efficiency.

Method: Used a 3D nnU-Net for lung segmentation and voxel-wise model fitting for IVIM parameter quantification.

Result: Segmentation achieved 82.14% Dice coefficient; IVIM results matched manual segmentation.

Conclusion: Fully automated pipeline is feasible for clinical fetal lung maturity assessment.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: Proposes R²MoE, a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept learning, addressing catastrophic forgetting and parameter expansion with routing distillation, redundancy removal, and hierarchical attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual concepts without catastrophic forgetting or excessive parameter growth.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-experts framework with routing distillation, redundancy removal of experts, and hierarchical local attention-guided inference.

Result: Achieves 87.8% reduction in forgetting rates and 63.3% fewer parameters, outperforming SOTA on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: R²MoE effectively balances learning new concepts and retaining old ones with minimal parameter overhead, setting a new benchmark for lifelong visual concept learning.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A registration-based framework for 3D anomaly detection using multi-prototype alignment and cluster-wise discrepancy analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution 3D point clouds are effective for industrial inspection but face challenges like computational cost and spatial misalignment.

Method: Combines multi-prototype alignment with cluster-wise discrepancy analysis, using keypoint-guided clustering for localized comparisons.

Result: Achieves top performance on the Real3D-AD benchmark for object-level and point-level anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The method enables precise anomaly localization using raw features, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal IRSTD framework integrates language priors with image data to enhance small target detection in infrared images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data, missing the potential of multimodal (image + text) approaches for improved detection.

Method: The framework uses GPT-4 to generate text descriptions of target locations, combining these with image data via language-guided attention. A new multimodal dataset is introduced.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa metrics on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k subsets.

Conclusion: Incorporating language priors into IRSTD enhances detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of multimodal approaches in this domain.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny objects in remote sensing images are hard to detect due to limited spatial info, weak features, and dense backgrounds. Existing detectors underperform.

Method: Introduces RS-TinyNet with tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Includes MDCA, ARB, and PFDH modules for feature enhancement.

Result: Achieves 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75 improvements on AI-TOD and performs well on DIOR benchmark.

Conclusion: RS-TinyNet's multi-stage fusion strategy is effective for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing robustness, generalization, and efficiency challenges in learning-based monocular visual odometry by leveraging DINOv2's capabilities while overcoming its coarse feature limitations.

Method: Proposes DINO-VO, combining DINOv2's features with a tailored keypoints detector, geometric features, and a transformer-based matcher for precise camera motion estimation.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on TartanAir and KITTI datasets, runs at 72 FPS with <1GB memory, and competes with Visual SLAM in outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: DINO-VO demonstrates superior robustness, accuracy, and generalization, making it a competitive solution for monocular visual odometry.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods rely on fixed LLM knowledge, lacking evolutionary capacity. Inspired by natural agents, SE-VLN enables continuous learning during testing.

Method: SE-VLN uses hierarchical memory, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and reflection modules to evolve through experience.

Result: Achieved 57% and 35.2% success rates in unseen environments, improving by 23.9% and 15.0% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SE-VLN demonstrates scalable performance with growing experience, proving its potential as a self-evolving VLN framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with long-horizon generation and generalization in challenging driving scenarios, prompting the need for a simpler, more effective solution.

Method: Developed a model with simple design choices, no additional supervision or sensors, and compared discrete token models with continuous autoregressive models using a hybrid tokenizer.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 469M parameters and 280h of training data, excelling in difficult scenarios. Continuous models outperform discrete ones.

Conclusion: Continuous autoregressive models are more robust and powerful than discrete token models, offering better performance in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of diverse and sufficient training data in the construction domain for visual AI.

Method: Generative-AI (Midjourney) creates 12,000 synthetic images from 3,000 prompts, manually labeled for DNN training.

Result: High APs (0.937, 0.642) on real images and near-perfect APs (0.994, 0.919) on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise but has limitations in addressing DNN data scarcity.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for detecting AI-generated videos using pre-trained visual models achieves over 90% accuracy, addressing the gap beyond deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of high-quality AI-generated videos necessitates robust detection methods to combat misinformation, privacy breaches, and security threats.

Method: Leverages features from pre-trained visual models to distinguish real from AI-generated videos, enhancing performance with a linear classification layer.

Result: Achieves over 90% detection accuracy on a dataset of 10,000 AI-generated and 4,000 real videos.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and scalable, with plans to release code, models, and dataset to aid further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we

### [75] [$S^2M^2$: Scalable Stereo Matching Model for Reliable Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13229)
*Junhong Min,Youngpil Jeon,Jimin Kim,Minyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $S^2M^2$ introduces a global matching architecture for stereo matching, balancing accuracy and efficiency without cost volume filtering, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between local search methods (limited global consistency) and global matching architectures (historically infeasible due to computational costs).

Method: Uses a multi-resolution transformer for long-range correspondence and a novel loss function to concentrate probability on feasible matches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in most metrics.

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$ resolves the trade-off, offering robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence with competitive efficiency.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

### [76] [VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231)
*Dechen Gao,Boqi Zhao,Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Hanchu Zhou,Hang Wang,Zhe Zhao,Junshan Zhang,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA is a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that directly maps latent visual representations to latent actions, eliminating conditioning modules and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow matching policies require additional conditioning mechanisms for action generation, creating overheads. VITA aims to simplify this by learning an inherent vision-to-action mapping.

Method: VITA uses a structured action latent space via an autoencoder, up-sampling raw actions to match visual shapes, and supervises flow matching with encoder targets and action outputs.

Result: VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies, reducing inference latency by 50-130% and solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of handling complex bi-manual tasks efficiently.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AOFT introduces an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning strategy for ViTs, improving generalization by aligning down/up-projection matrices with backbone properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of orthogonality in down/up-projection matrices compared to backbone matrices may limit generalization in PEFT.

Method: AOFT uses a learnable vector to generate approximately orthogonal vectors for down/up-projection matrices, matching backbone properties.

Result: AOFT achieves competitive performance in downstream image classification tasks, validating improved generalization.

Conclusion: AOFT enhances generalization in fine-tuned ViTs by enforcing orthogonality in low-rank adaptation matrices.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffClean uses a text-guided diffusion model to remove makeup traces, improving age verification and face recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age verification is crucial for protecting minors online, but makeup can deceive systems.

Method: Proposes DiffClean, a text-guided diffusion model to erase makeup traces.

Result: Improves age estimation by 4.8% and face verification by 8.9% over baselines.

Conclusion: DiffClean effectively counters makeup attacks, enhancing accuracy in age and face verification.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

TL;DR: FashionPose is a text-to-pose-to-relighting framework for realistic garment visualization, enabling pose synthesis and lighting control via text input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack flexibility in pose and lighting control for fashion e-commerce.

Method: Uses text to predict 2D poses, generate images via diffusion, and apply relighting.

Result: Achieves fine-grained pose synthesis and consistent relighting.

Conclusion: Offers a practical solution for personalized virtual fashion displays.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

TL;DR: The RPE benchmark for pose-aware MLLMs has reproducibility and quality issues, including mismatched image indices and flawed benchmark design. The authors refined GT annotations and released them to improve evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues in the RPE benchmark to ensure fair and consistent evaluations of pose-aware MLLMs.

Method: Identified issues like image index mismatches and benchmark flaws, then refined GT annotations through visual matching.

Result: Released refined GT annotations as an open-source resource to enhance reproducibility and evaluation reliability.

Conclusion: The refined annotations aim to promote consistent evaluations and support future advancements in pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time method for detecting hand-object interactions using a cascaded architecture with action recognition and object detection modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-object interaction detection is challenging but crucial for intuitive user experiences in real-time applications.

Method: The approach combines an action recognition module (Mamba model with EfficientNetV2) and an object detection module (fine-tuned YOLOWorld) in a cascaded architecture.

Result: The model achieves 38.52% p-AP on ENIGMA-51 for action recognition and 85.13% AP for hand and object detection.

Conclusion: The cascaded architecture enables efficient real-time detection of hand-object interactions.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Motivation: DiT's high computational cost limits its use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones, hindering real-time performance.

Result: The optimizations enable 10 FPS video generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Conclusion: Real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices is feasible with the proposed optimizations.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on

TL;DR: Proposes a sliding iterative denoising process to improve spatio-temporal consistency in 4D diffusion models for high-fidelity human view synthesis from sparse-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D diffusion models for novel-view video synthesis lack spatio-temporal consistency, degrading output quality.

Method: Uses a latent grid encoding image, camera pose, and human pose, denoised alternately along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window.

Result: Achieves high-quality, consistent novel-view videos, outperforming existing methods on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets.

Conclusion: The sliding iterative denoising process enhances 4D consistency and GPU efficiency, improving view synthesis quality.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Conclusion: The proposed IMBA loss effectively improves complex concept responses in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex

under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors

design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset

TL;DR: AutoPartGen is an autoregressive model for generating 3D objects from parts, using inputs like images, masks, or existing 3D objects. It leverages a latent 3D representation (3DShape2VecSet) for part-based generation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compositional 3D reconstruction from diverse inputs (images, masks, or 3D objects) by leveraging the compositional properties of a latent 3D space.

Method: AutoPartGen generates parts autoregressively, conditioning on prior parts and inputs (images, masks, or 3D objects), and stops when all parts are generated. No additional optimization is needed for assembly.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation, with seamless assembly of parts into coherent objects.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen effectively generates 3D objects from parts autoregressively, demonstrating strong compositional capabilities and high-quality results.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

TL;DR: VisionThink dynamically adjusts visual token resolution for VLMs, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most real-world scenarios don't require extensive visual tokens, yet current methods use fixed compression, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Proposes VisionThink, which starts with downsampled images and requests higher resolution only if needed, using reinforcement learning for decision-making.

Result: Achieves strong performance on OCR tasks while saving tokens on simpler tasks, with stable resize call ratios.

Conclusion: VisionThink offers a superior, efficient, and effective paradigm for visual token compression in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of fixed complexity in hierarchical flow matching's velocity distributions, the study explores gradual complexity adjustment.

Method: Proposes mini-batch couplings within hierarchical rectified flow matching to vary distribution complexity across hierarchy levels.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on synthetic and imaging data, validating the effectiveness of mini-batch couplings.

Conclusion: Mini-batch couplings enhance hierarchical flow matching by dynamically adjusting distribution complexity, offering better modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video frame selection struggle with complex long video scenarios, lacking alignment with user instructions.

Method: Proposes VideoITG with VidThinker pipeline: generates clip-level captions, retrieves relevant segments, and selects informative frames. Uses VideoITG-40K dataset and a plug-and-play model for discriminative frame selection.

Result: VideoITG consistently improves Video-LLMs' performance across multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoITG demonstrates superior potential for enhancing video understanding through instruction-aligned frame selection.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.
