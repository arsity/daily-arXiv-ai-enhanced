To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global\nSemantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional\nlocal features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with\nconditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent\nframes. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,\nsignificantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive\nevaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since\nour model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly\nhigher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some\nimage-based models.

THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark\nthat can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as\nwell as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison.
