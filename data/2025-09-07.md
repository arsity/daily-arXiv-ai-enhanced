### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for skeleton-based action recognition that replaces low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction across spatial-temporal hierarchies, achieving 6.2x faster training and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked autoencoder approaches for skeleton-based action recognition limit reconstruction to raw joint coordinates, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation.

Method: Proposes GFP framework with collaborative learning where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, incorporating constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity and prevent model collapse.

Result: Achieves 6.2x faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods and superior representation quality, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: The GFP framework effectively addresses computational redundancy and limited semantics in existing approaches by shifting from low-level reconstruction to high-level feature prediction, offering both efficiency and superior performance in skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Susan Done,Dimitrios Androutsos,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based mitosis detection using teacher-student UNet with domain generalization for robust segmentation and classification across different domains and imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mitosis counting is time-consuming and subjective. AI solutions face domain shift issues and severe class imbalance between mitotic figures and normal nuclei.

Method: Pixel-level segmentation with UNet backbone, teacher-student model with contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training. Multi-scale CNN classifier for atypical mitosis classification within multi-task learning.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification on preliminary test set.

Conclusion: Integration of segmentation-based detection and classification in unified framework effectively addresses domain shift and data imbalance for robust mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM is a two-stage framework that addresses multiple overlapping biases in vision models by first learning to recognize biases through adaptive encoders, then pruning bias directions from gradients, resulting in improved worst-group accuracy and reduced bias amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images contain multiple overlapping biases that collectively impair vision model performance and fairness. Addressing biases individually is inadequate as mitigating one bias often intensifies others.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) trains encoders for each attribute and integrates them with main backbone to explicitly recognize biases; 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes bias directions from backbone's gradients. Also introduces Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) metric to handle subgroup imbalance and distribution shifts.

Result: Validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets - boosts worst group accuracy, halves multi-attribute bias amplification, and sets new low in SBA even with increasing bias complexity and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GMBM is the first practical, end-to-end multi-bias solution for visual recognition that effectively handles multiple overlapping biases while requiring group labels only during training.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight U-Net achieves equivalent cardiac segmentation performance to nnU-Net with 16x smaller size and 4x faster speed through optimized components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time clinical measurements from echocardiography by reducing the computational burden of large segmentation models while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Conducted ablation study to identify most effective nnU-Net components, then developed lightweight U-Net with simplified augmentations and architecture while keeping deep supervision.

Result: Achieved statistically equivalent Dice scores (0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89) with 2M vs 33M parameters, 16x smaller and 4x faster (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) on CAMUS dataset.

Conclusion: Simple affine augmentations and deep supervision are key for performance, while complex components offer diminishing returns, enabling efficient real-time cardiac segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Revised treeX algorithm for unsupervised tree instance segmentation in laser scanning data, offering resource-efficient alternative to deep learning with improved runtime and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources, creating need for more efficient unsupervised approaches.

Method: Revised version of treeX algorithm combining clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation, with parameter presets for ground-based (TLS/PLS) and UAV-borne (ULS) laser scanning.

Result: Reduces runtime and improves accuracy compared to original treeX, with F1-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. Achieves F1-score of 0.58 for ULS data where original algorithm failed. Matches accuracy of recent open-source methods including deep learning for TLS/PLS data.

Conclusion: Method serves as resource-efficient alternative to deep learning and enables semi-automatic label generation for training deep learning models. Open-source Python implementation provided for broader adoption.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D is a novel framework that uses geometry-aware supervision through object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks to improve 3D scene understanding in multimodal models, outperforming text-only supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Multimodal Models excel in 2D visual understanding but struggle with 3D scene understanding due to reliance on text-only supervision, which lacks geometric constraints needed for robust spatial representations.

Method: Reg3D uses a dual-supervision paradigm with 3D geometric information as both input and explicit learning targets. It employs a dual-encoder architecture with complementary object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks to enforce geometric consistency and develop spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D benchmarks demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models by incorporating geometry-aware supervision, effectively addressing the limitations of text-only supervision for 3D understanding.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

*Seth Z. Zhao,Huizhi Zhang,Zhaowei Li,Juntong Peng,Anthony Chui,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Hao Xiang,Zhiyu Huang,Fujia Wang,Ran Tian,Chenfeng Xu,Bolei Zhou,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X is the first fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception that reduces computational/transmission costs while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X cooperative perception systems focus on accuracy but ignore efficiency, latency, and real-world deployability issues caused by high computational/transmission costs of full-precision models.

Method: Introduces a unified end-to-end quantization strategy across neural network models and transmitted message representations to simultaneously reduce computational load and transmission bandwidth.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision systems while reducing system-level latency by 3.2x and improving mAP30 by +9.5 over baselines. Enables larger models within strict memory budgets.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the viability of fully quantized multi-agent intermediate fusion systems for real-world V2X deployment, offering efficient and scalable cooperative perception.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Result: ResNet50 showed overfitting (94.11% training vs 88.45% testing accuracy). MobileNetV2 achieved 93.34% testing accuracy with good generalization. EfficientNetB0 performed best with 94.67% testing accuracy and all metrics exceeding 94.6%.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, shows strong potential for developing scalable and accurate automated plant taxonomy tools using venation traits, with EfficientNetB0 demonstrating superior robustness in classification.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN is an efficient graph comparison method for floor plans that delays cross-graph interactions to the end, using a differentiable graph kernel for faster inference while maintaining comparable or better performance than graph matching networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph matching networks for floor plan comparison rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, making them slow during inference time. There's a need for more efficient methods that maintain performance while increasing speed.

Method: LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture and uses a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings.

Result: LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing the inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed LayoutGKN approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional graph matching networks for floor plan comparison, achieving similar or better performance with significantly faster inference times.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD is a parameter-efficient adaptation method that uses Singular Value Decomposition to fine-tune only 0.04% of CLIP's parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 21 datasets while preserving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language models like CLIP to fine-grained domains is challenging due to reliance on prompt engineering and high cost of full fine-tuning. Existing methods with additional components can limit adaptation quality and destabilize the model.

Method: Leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify CLIP's internal parameter space without adding modules. Only fine-tunes singular values of parameter matrices to rescale basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining pretrained weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets. Outperforms previous methods in accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings using only 0.04% of total parameters.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD provides an effective, parameter-efficient adaptation technique that preserves pretrained knowledge while enabling superior domain adaptation performance and interpretability through natural language analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed STA-Net with Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) for efficient plant disease diagnosis on edge devices, achieving 89% accuracy with only 401K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying high-precision plant disease diagnosis models on edge devices, as existing attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition fail to capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex textures.

Method: Twofold approach: 1) Training-free neural architecture search (DeepMAD) for efficient backbone, 2) Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) with dual branches - deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

Result: STA-Net achieved 89.00% accuracy and 88.96% F1 score on CCMT plant disease dataset with only 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs, significantly outperforming baseline and standard attention models.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge through decoupled attention mechanisms provides an effective path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI, with STAM demonstrating superior performance in capturing pathological features.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UCOD task and DeepCamo dataset, proposes SLENet framework with GAE module and LGB for enhanced underwater camouflaged object detection, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection is critical for marine ecology but underexplored due to optical distortions, water turbidity, and complex marine organism traits.

Method: Proposes Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet) with Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement module and Localization Guidance Branch to enhance multi-scale features and generate semantic-rich location maps, guided by Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder.

Result: SLENet achieves superior performance on DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets, demonstrating high generality for broader camouflaged object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SLENet framework effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges and shows strong generalization capabilities across different datasets.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple training strategy that leverages temporal coherence in video frames to improve diffusion model training, achieving 2x faster convergence and better performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image diffusion models trained on static images are information-deficient for capturing temporal dynamics, leading to slower convergence, limited distribution coverage, and reduced generalization.

Method: Proposes a training strategy that utilizes temporal inductive bias from continuous video frames, requiring no architectural modifications and seamlessly integrating into standard diffusion training pipelines.

Result: Achieves over 2x faster convergence, lower FID scores on both training and validation distributions, and improved generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations. Optimization analysis shows reduced gradient variance.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal coherence in video frames is an effective way to enhance diffusion model training, providing faster convergence and better performance while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic diagnostic errors remain prevalent due to missed localized abnormalities, limited global context in 3D imaging, and variability in report language. Existing 3D vision-language models cannot jointly address precise detection, global reasoning, and consistent reporting needs.

Method: Multi-scale semantic-enriched pretraining framework with local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning. Uses language model rewrites and Radiology Semantic Matching Bank to handle report variability and enable semantics-aware alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering. Also transfers well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MedVista3D effectively addresses key challenges in 3D radiology analysis by combining local disease detection with holistic interpretation and semantic-consistent reporting, demonstrating strong performance across multiple medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [15] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL is a causality-guided text prompt learning method that uses visual granulation to improve CLIP's performance on fine-grained recognition tasks by capturing subtle class differences through causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods show limited ability in handling fine-grained datasets, failing to capture subtle discrepancies between similar classes.

Method: Two modules: 1) Attribute disentanglement using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to separate shared and class-specific attributes, 2) Granule learning module that constructs visual granules using these attributes under causal inference strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show CaPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, particularly on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed visual granulation technique enables more discriminative text prompts by capturing subtle class differences through causal inference, making CLIP more effective for fine-grained recognition tasks.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based turbulence mitigation using event cameras for efficient lucky fusion, achieving 710x smaller model size and better restoration quality than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning TM methods require high-capacity networks to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited frame-rate, lacking computational and storage efficiency.

Method: Proposes EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from event streams using 'event-lucky insight' about correlation between turbulence distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams.

Result: Surpasses existing SOTA TM method by 710x in model size, 214x in inference latency, 224x in model complexity, while achieving +0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM improvement on real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Event cameras provide great efficiency merit for turbulence mitigation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of introducing event modality into TM.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba is a novel RGB-Event detection method that uses adaptive collaborative sparsification to efficiently process multimodal features by discarding low-information regions based on event camera scene changes, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process all regions uniformly, including low-information areas, leading to high computational costs and suboptimal performance. Fixed token selection methods fail to adapt to varying sample complexity.

Method: Proposes FocusMamba with Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions using event camera scene changes, and Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to effectively integrate complementary features.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets show superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusMamba successfully addresses computational redundancy in multimodal feature processing through adaptive sparsification and achieves optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SalientFusion for Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition, addressing background redundancy, role confusion, and semantic bias through SalientFormer and DebiasAT components, achieving SOTA results on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition needs methods for unseen categories, but faces challenges with background distractions, dish role confusion, and semantic bias in zero-shot learning.

Method: SalientFusion with two components: SalientFormer removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on proposed benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as on popular general CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in compositional zero-shot food recognition and demonstrates superior performance on both food-specific and general benchmarks.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

### [20] [OccTENS: 3D Occupancy World Model via Temporal Next-Scale Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03887)
*Bu Jin,Songen Gu,Xiaotao Hu,Yupeng Zheng,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiaoxiao Long,Wei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS is a generative occupancy world model that uses temporal next-scale prediction to enable efficient, high-fidelity long-term 3D occupancy generation with improved controllability over ego-motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive approaches for occupancy world modeling suffer from inefficiency, temporal degradation in long-term generation, and lack of controllability over vehicle movement and scene evolution.

Method: Reformulates occupancy modeling as temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, decomposing temporal sequence modeling into spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction using a TensFormer architecture with holistic pose aggregation for unified occupancy and ego-motion modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides an effective solution for controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency through its novel temporal next-scale prediction approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

### [21] [Weakly-Supervised Learning of Dense Functional Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03893)
*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised method for dense functional correspondence across object categories using vision-language models and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object function guides correspondence establishment as functional parts share shape/appearance similarities across categories, enabling better matching for tasks like shape reconstruction and robot manipulation.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images for functional parts, then integrate with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill functional and spatial knowledge.

Result: Outperforms baseline solutions using off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models on curated synthetic and real evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully establishes dense functional correspondence by combining vision-language pseudo-labeling with contrastive learning, demonstrating advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP excel in zero-shot recognition but struggle with few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline fine-tuning and overfitting risks.

Method: Proposes a dual attention mechanism: Memory Attn-Adapter refines category embeddings using support examples, and Local-Global Attn-Adapter enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while maintaining efficient inference and scalability across CLIP backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS is a new efficient reference-free metric for long image caption evaluation that matches LLM-based metrics in human correlation while being much faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for long image captions have limitations: n-gram metrics lack semantic understanding, RS metrics have low human correlation, and LLM-based metrics are too expensive for iterative development.

Method: SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity - rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones in long captions.

Result: SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments while being significantly more efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical and efficient alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided

architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding framework that leverages inter-view motion and content correlations to significantly improve compression efficiency while maintaining random access and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview video enables immersive 3D scene reconstruction but has massive data volume requiring efficient compression. Traditional deep learning video coding focuses on single-view or stereo, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored.

Method: Feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction using decoded independent-view motion features, inter-view motion entropy model, disparity-free inter-view context prediction from independent-view content features, and inter-view contextual entropy model.

Result: Outperforms traditional MV-HEVC standard reference software by a large margin in compression efficiency.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong baseline for learned multiview video coding research, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods through effective exploitation of inter-view correlations.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D tubular structures that addresses limitations of existing methods by using holistic modeling, topological integrity constraints, and curriculum refinement to significantly improve both geometric and topological accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing medical tubular structures rely on voxel-wise overlap measures that fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Current topology-aware approaches are patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors during inference.

Method: TopoSculpt uses (i) holistic whole-region modeling to capture full spatial context, (ii) Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Substantial improvements in both geometry and topology: β₀ errors reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on Circle of Willis dataset. Tree length detected and branch detected rates improved by nearly 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods for medical tubular structure reconstruction.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and

Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack understanding of OOD images and suffer from false negative labels that degrade near-OOD performance, requiring a more accurate negative space construction approach.

Method: Leverage MLLMs to identify OOD samples and generate expressive negative sentences for far-OOD detection. For near-OOD, identify visually similar ID classes and use MLLMs to generate tailored negative labels. Use adaptive weighted score to balance both negative spaces.

Result: On ImageNet benchmark, ANTS reduces FPR95 by 4.2%, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. The method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

Conclusion: ANTS effectively addresses OOD detection challenges by creating adaptive negative textual spaces through MLLM understanding, improving both far-OOD and near-OOD performance without task-specific prior knowledge.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange is a multimodal remote sensing change detection method that combines image and text modalities to improve accuracy and robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing remote sensing change detection methods rely solely on image modality, which limits feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization under illumination and noise disturbances.

Method: Proposes MMChange with three key modules: Image Feature Refinement (IFR) to highlight key regions and suppress noise, uses vision language model to generate semantic descriptions, Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) to capture semantic shifts, and Image-Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) for cross-modal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD datasets demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining image and text modalities effectively enhances remote sensing change detection accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of multimodal integration for this task.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL is a novel multiple instance learning method for WSI classification that uses positional encoding and MLP-based full instance correlations, achieving SOTA performance with linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Transformer-based methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, which require custom CUDA kernels and struggle with spatial relationships and length extrapolation issues.

Method: Proposes Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning with: 1) Positional encoding module using instance coordinates instead of sequence index, 2) SAC block (MLP-based) for full instance correlations with linear time complexity.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL provides an efficient and easily deployable alternative to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification, handling spatial relationships and variable sequence lengths effectively.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning framework for liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI using auxiliary contrast-enhanced data during training to reduce annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation is crucial for analyzing vascular changes in liver diseases, but existing methods require contrast-enhanced imaging which is not always available. Non-contrast MRI is more common but challenging to segment without large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning framework that leverages paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data (with and without vessel annotations) during training. The approach uses auxiliary contrast-enhanced data to improve feature representation through shared task structure.

Result: Auxiliary contrast-enhanced data improves vessel segmentation accuracy in non-contrast MRI, even when not available during inference. Benefits are most significant when few annotations are available for training.

Conclusion: An auxiliary informative imaging modality can effectively augment expert annotations and improve segmentation performance, even when only available during training. The approach shows cross-domain applicability as validated with brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design significantly affects LMM performance in MCQA, with up to 15% accuracy variations. Promptception framework evaluates 10 LMMs across 61 prompt types, revealing proprietary models are more sensitive while open-source models are steadier but struggle with complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Multimodal Models in Multiple-Choice Question Answering remains poorly understood, and minor prompt variations can cause significant accuracy deviations, posing challenges for fair model evaluation.

Method: Introduce Promptception framework with 61 prompt types across 15 categories and 6 supercategories to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs across 3 MCQA benchmarks (MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench).

Result: Proprietary models show greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing (reflecting tighter instruction alignment), while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing.

Conclusion: Propose tailored Prompting Principles for proprietary and open-source LMMs to enable more robust and fair model evaluation, addressing prompt sensitivity issues in MCQA tasks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc - a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that addresses height-axis information neglect in existing methods through global/local vertical slices and SEAttention3D module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features, and conventional channel attention assigns uniform weights across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights.

Method: Extracts voxel features along height-axis using global and local vertical slices, employs global local fusion module to reconcile spatial details with contextual information, and introduces SEAttention3D module that preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets show significant mean IoU improvements, with especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories.

Conclusion: The proposed SliceSemOcc framework effectively addresses height-axis information processing limitations in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, validated by comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

*Solha Kang,Esla Timothy Anzaku,Wesley De Neve,Arnout Van Messem,Joris Vankerschaver,Francois Rameau,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, showing training methodology impacts reliance on spurious signals and identifying problematic ImageNet classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can exploit unintended patterns in data (spurious correlations), leading to correct predictions based on wrong signals, which undermines model trustworthiness and generalizability.

Method: Proposed detection method for vision transformers using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, with large-scale experiments on ImageNet dataset.

Result: Method successfully identifies spurious correlations; training methodology significantly affects model reliance on spurious signals; certain ImageNet classes contain easily detected spurious signals.

Conclusion: Provides exhaustive list of problematic images and calls for caution in their use; includes real-world case study on breast mass classification to demonstrate practical relevance.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Learning from Majority Label (LML), a novel multi-class MIL problem where bag labels are determined by majority class of instances. Introduces Counting Network and Majority Proportion Enhancement Module to improve instance-level classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses real-world applications where only majority class labels are available for bags of instances, such as pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Uses a Counting Network to estimate bag-level majority labels by counting instances per class. Implements Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to remove minority class instances and increase majority class proportion within bags.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over conventional MIL methods on four datasets. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each proposed module.

Conclusion: LML is a valuable problem with practical applications. The proposed Counting Network with MPEM effectively solves the majority label learning problem and outperforms existing MIL approaches.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: Provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring and domestic chip applications, successfully addressing real-time response challenges in video surveillance through heterogeneous computing architecture.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video

TL;DR: An efficient re-ranking method for person re-identification that uses K-nearest Weighted Fusion to generate multi-view features from neighbors, improving accuracy without model fine-tuning or extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous re-identification methods rely on single-view images which suffer from view bias, pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Multi-view features can help reduce these issues and improve re-ranking accuracy.

Method: Uses K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) to aggregate neighbors' features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Explores different weight selection strategies during feature aggregation without requiring model fine-tuning or additional annotations.

Result: Significant improvements in Rank@1 and mAP on Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC datasets. Achieved 9.8% and 22.0% Rank@1 improvements on MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC respectively. Also demonstrates substantial computational efficiency improvements compared to other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: The proposed KWF-based re-ranking method effectively reduces view bias by generating multi-view features from neighbors, significantly improving re-identification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring no additional training or annotations.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

TL;DR: Proposes BiT and CATS modules to address error amplification in Audio-Visual Video Parsing by combining semantic purification with temporal graph propagation for SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVVP methods either treat noisy pseudo-labels as reliable supervision or spread indiscriminate attention across frames, amplifying initial errors during training.

Method: Combines Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module for semantic injection and dynamic calibration of audio-visual features, and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module for semantic propagation across time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple key indicators across two benchmark datasets (LLP and UnAV-100).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates strengths of previous research directions to locate and purify semantic cues while enabling precise information dissemination, overcoming error amplification issues.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Motivation: Existing text-to-story visualization methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling experiences.

Method: Uses pre-trained LLM for per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning. Implements bounded attention-based per-box mask technique for character interaction control, identity-consistent self-attention for cross-frame consistency, and region-aware cross-attention for precise object placement. Dialogues are rendered as bubbles and assigned via CLIPSeg.

Result: Experimental results show TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in text-to-story visualization by maintaining character consistency and accurate dialogue assignment through innovative attention mechanisms and postprocessing techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEPG framework uses LLMs to decompose prompts into spatial coordinates and style instructions, then employs multi-expert diffusion with dynamic routing for improved text-to-image generation with better spatial accuracy and style diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex multi-element prompts and limited stylistic diversity, needing better spatial understanding and specialized style handling.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Position-Style-Aware LLM module for prompt decomposition, 2) Multi-Expert Diffusion module with dynamic expert routing and attention-based gating for specialized region generation.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline models with same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: MEPG provides effective solution for complex text-to-image generation with improved spatial accuracy, style diversity, and extensible expert integration.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

*Orlando Castaneda,Kevin So-Tang,Kshitij Gurung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Better hyperparameter tuning of a simple vision backbone approach achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, competing with commercial detectors and surpassing previous baseline by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly (61-69% accuracy) on real-world benchmarks compared to commercial solutions (82%), suggesting simple approaches may be underoptimized rather than inadequate.

Method: Revisits Ojha et al.'s approach of adapting standard pretrained vision backbones for deepfake detection, but with improved hyperparameter tuning rather than complex architectural changes.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, an 18% improvement over previously reported baseline performance and competitive with leading commercial detectors.

Conclusion: Simple vision backbone approaches with proper hyperparameter tuning can achieve state-of-the-art deepfake detection performance, making them practical for real-world deployment due to good accuracy-computational cost tradeoffs.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of YOLO models combining visible and thermal imagery improves wind turbine defect detection accuracy over single-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs with advanced sensors enable wind power plant monitoring, but reliable defect detection requires high-resolution multispectral data processing methods.

Method: Developed ensemble approach integrating general-purpose YOLOv8 with specialized thermal model using bounding box fusion algorithm to combine predictions from visible and thermal channels.

Result: Achieved mAP@.5 of 0.93 and F1-score of 0.90, outperforming standalone YOLOv8 model (mAP@.5 of 0.91).

Conclusion: Combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides more reliable detection of both visual and thermal defects in wind turbine components.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web application that uses AI-assisted automation to streamline image labeling, reducing manual effort by up to 90% while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image annotation tools require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. AI models need annotated data to learn patterns, but annotation is labor-intensive.

Method: Integrates foundation models (CLIP, Ultralytics detectors, Grounding DINO) with filtering pipeline. Uses low-confidence thresholding for initial annotations, interactive refinement tools, and WebGPU-accelerated segmentation. Features clustering and IoU-graph for redundancy suppression.

Result: Up to 90% reduction in manual effort while maintaining high annotation accuracy. Initial predictions proven mostly correct for COCO-type classes. Supports multiple export formats and offline operation.

Conclusion: VisioFirm successfully addresses scalability issues in image annotation through AI-assisted automation, significantly reducing human effort while preserving annotation quality through hybrid AI-human approach.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUDE is a novel unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval method that uses text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCIR methods struggle with domain gaps because object features are entangled with domain-specific styles, making cross-domain retrieval challenging without annotations.

Method: Leverages text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain styles, and aligns mutual neighbors progressively from within domains to across domains for reliable feature alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets spanning 13 domains, demonstrating superior cross-domain retrieval capabilities.

Conclusion: DUDE effectively addresses the domain gap challenge in unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval through feature disentanglement and progressive alignment, offering a promising solution for semantic image retrieval across diverse domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER is a self-evolving framework that enhances VLMs' multi-step perception for precise coordinate prediction in GUI grounding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScreenSpot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling VLMs to effectively reason over appropriate image regions remains challenging in GUI grounding, especially with high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions.

Method: Integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation to construct high-quality preference data, guiding models to focus on instruction-relevant regions and adapt reasoning steps based on task complexity.

Result: Achieves 55.7 score on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark with GTA1-7B model, establishing new state-of-the-art among 7B-scale models with consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot benchmarks.

Conclusion: LASER framework successfully endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities for precise coordinate prediction, demonstrating effectiveness through comprehensive benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

### [48] [Differential Morphological Profile Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04268)
*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating differential morphological profile (DMP) features into semantic segmentation networks improves performance for overhead remote sensing imagery by addressing scale variation and shape information challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art segmentation networks are optimized for ground-perspective photos and don't handle remote sensing challenges like extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes that are common in overhead imagery.

Method: Incorporated DMP (multi-scale shape extraction method) into three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using both direct input (adapting input stems) and hybrid dual-stream designs that fuse RGB and DMP encoders. Evaluated various DMP differentials and structuring element shapes on the iSAID dataset.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures consistently outperformed direct-input variants and were capable of surpassing non-DMP models on mIoU, F1, and Recall metrics.

Conclusion: DMP integration, particularly through hybrid dual-stream architectures, provides effective shape information that enhances semantic segmentation performance for overhead remote sensing imagery, addressing key challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided 3D diffusion model that synthesizes tau PET images using structural MRI and plasma p-tau217 measurements as multimodal conditions, providing a cost-effective alternative to actual tau PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET scans are crucial for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis but are expensive and limited in availability, while structural MRI and plasma biomarkers are more accessible and provide complementary information.

Method: Proposed a text-guided 3D diffusion model that uses plasma p-tau217 measurements as textual prompts and structural MRI for anatomical constraints to synthesize 3D tau PET images.

Result: The approach successfully generated realistic and clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across various disease stages using ADNI clinical data.

Conclusion: This framework enables tau PET data augmentation, provides a non-invasive cost-effective visualization alternative, and supports disease progression simulation under different biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that integrates spatial regularization and volume priors using Wasserstein distance constraints at both image and dataset scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks overlook effective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from datasets.

Method: Integrates explicit volume prior at image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization from variational models into backbone segmentation network. Uses regression network to estimate target region volumes and enforces constraints through image-scale and dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss functions.

Result: Experimental results on 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages volume priors and spatial regularization to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view (as few as 4 views) unposed images without camera supervision


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, enabling articulated object learning under weaker input assumptions

Method: Reconstruct each articulation independently using sparse-view 3D reconstruction, learn deformation field for cross-pose correspondences, progressive disentanglement of static/moving parts, joint optimization of geometry, appearance, and kinematics with self-supervised cross-view/pose consistency loss

Result: Produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations on standard benchmark and real-world examples

Conclusion: The method successfully learns articulated object representations from sparse, unposed images without camera supervision, outperforming existing approaches under significantly weaker input requirements

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic noise in image classification datasets where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled poses significant challenges to conventional supervised learning approaches.

Method: Proposes leveraging synthetic images with reliable labels as reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples, rather than directly using them for training. The method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust techniques.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy across multiple benchmarks: 30% improvement on CIFAR-10, 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

Conclusion: Synthetic images can effectively serve as reliable references for correcting label noise, especially semantic noise, and the approach complements existing noise-robust methods to achieve superior performance.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100

Motivation: The odd-one-out anomaly detection task presents challenges requiring spatial reasoning across views and relational reasoning for context understanding, needing efficient solutions.

Method: Proposed a DINO-based model that significantly reduces computational requirements compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: Achieved one-third parameter reduction and three times faster training while maintaining competitive performance; also evaluated MLLM limitations in visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed efficient DINO-based approach successfully addresses odd-one-out detection challenges with reduced computational costs, highlighting current limitations of multimodal LLMs in structured visual reasoning.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third

*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena is an open platform that addresses data leakage and privacy issues in image geolocalization evaluation by using in-the-wild images and human pairwise judgments instead of exact coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image geolocalization evaluation suffers from data leakage (LVLMs pretrained on test data) and privacy concerns with exact coordinate metrics that neglect reasoning processes.

Method: Developed GeoArena platform that allows users to upload in-the-wild images and uses pairwise human judgments to evaluate which model outputs better align with human expectations.

Result: Deployed online for 2 months, collected thousands of voting records, established detailed analysis and leaderboard comparing different LVLMs on geolocalization tasks.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more accurate, privacy-preserving, and human-centered benchmarking approach for evaluating image geolocalization capabilities of large vision-language models.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

*JiYuan Wang,Chunyu Lin,Lei Sun,Rongying Liu,Lang Nie,Mingxing Li,Kang Liao,Xiangxiang Chu,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FE2E framework adapts image editing models (not text-to-image generators) for dense geometry prediction, achieving significant performance gains in depth and normal estimation with novel training objectives and quantization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting image editing models may be more suitable than text-to-image generative models as foundation for fine-tuning. Editing models possess inherent structural priors that enable better convergence and higher performance.

Method: FE2E adapts Diffusion Transformer (DiT) editing model with consistent velocity training objective (reformulating flow matching loss), logarithmic quantization to handle precision conflicts, and leverages global attention for joint depth and normal estimation in single forward pass.

Result: Achieves over 35% performance gains on ETH3D dataset, outperforms DepthAnything series trained on 100x more data, and shows impressive zero-shot performance improvements across multiple datasets without scaling training data.

Conclusion: Image editing models are superior to generative models for dense geometry prediction tasks due to their inherent structural priors, and the FE2E framework effectively adapts editing models for deterministic prediction tasks with novel technical innovations.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Zhen Lin,Xinlong Rao,Anyang Tong,Shiyao Li,Fei Wang,Changlin Chen,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MICACL is a novel multi-instance learning framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that addresses long-tailed distributions and spatio-temporal complexity through graph-enhanced instance interaction, weighted aggregation, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFER methods struggle with long-tailed category distributions and complex spatio-temporal feature modeling, leading to severe model induction bias that limits performance.

Method: Proposes MICACL framework with: 1) Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) for spatio-temporal dependency modeling using adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions, 2) Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN) for dynamic importance-based weighting, and 3) Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy for balanced training across categories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-the-wild datasets (DFEW and FERV39k) with superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively addresses key challenges in DFER by integrating spatio-temporal modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

*Dor Cohen,Inga Efrosman,Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline that converts body-camera footage into panoramic images for rapid situational awareness in emergency response scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders need quick visual summaries of incident scenes from body-worn camera footage, as reviewing lengthy videos is impractical in time-critical situations.

Method: Uses monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct spatial layout, clusters camera poses to identify key viewpoints, selects representative frames, and fuses them into panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques.

Result: The system generates spatially coherent panoramic images that summarize complex environments, enabling rapid understanding of incident scenes.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates efficient decision-making and incident review by providing concise visual summaries that can be quickly interpreted in emergency response situations.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM is the first framework using Large Multi-modal Models for text-based person anomaly search, addressing fine-grained cross-modal alignment and sparse anomaly samples through a training-free adaptation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based person anomaly search is critical for public safety but faces challenges in fine-grained cross-modal alignment and sparse real-world anomaly samples. Current LMMs have potential but are hindered by domain gaps and lack efficient adaptation strategies.

Method: Proposes AnomalyLMM with a coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs, featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking for zero-shot anomaly detection without training.

Result: Achieves +0.96% improvement in Recall@1 accuracy on the PAB dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in retrieving real-world anomalies like falling, collision, and being hit scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection, providing interpretable alignment between textual descriptions and visual behaviors, with code and models to be released for future research.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

*Yilin Tao,Jiashui Huang,Huaze Xu,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASE-MLLM is a novel framework that integrates aesthetic saliency into multimodal LLMs for aesthetic image captioning, achieving SOTA performance by explicitly focusing on aesthetic content rather than just ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIC methods using MLLMs don't specifically adapt to aesthetic content and primarily rely on fine-tuning without aesthetic focus. Most image aesthetics research concentrates on rating prediction rather than captioning.

Method: Proposed ASE-MLLM with Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic saliency features, and IAS-ViT encoder that fuses aesthetic features with original image features via cross-attention mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show ASE-MLLM significantly outperforms traditional methods and generic MLLMs on mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM is the first framework to successfully integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks, demonstrating superior performance through explicit aesthetic content focus.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D style transfer pipeline that uses 2D diffusion priors to generate stylized key views with cross-view attention and instance-level consistency, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics and maintaining structural clarity, often resulting in indistinguishable objects within stylized 3D scenes.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints with cross-view attention for style fidelity and consistency, 2) Transfer stylized key views to 3D representation with instance-level style transfer.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various scenes (forward-facing to 360-degree environments), producing more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylizations.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations of existing 3D style transfer methods by leveraging 2D diffusion models and ensuring instance-level consistency, resulting in superior stylized 3D representations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR is a self-supervised neural framework that simultaneously reconstructs objects and unknown probes in X-ray ptychography, achieving superior quality and robustness in low-signal conditions without requiring probe pre-characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography faces challenges in accurate image reconstruction when the illuminating probe is unknown, especially under low-signal conditions. Conventional methods and deep learning approaches are suboptimal, limiting reconstruction fidelity and broader adoption of the technique.

Method: PtyINR parameterizes both object and probe as continuous neural representations, performing end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without pre-characterization of the probe. It's a self-supervised, physics-informed framework.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a generalizable framework for probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems beyond X-ray ptychography.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for real-world multimodal safety scenarios, generating 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses and proposing a standardized safety evaluation metric using fine-tuned safety judge models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented dataset construction methods fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios, and there's a lack of unified evaluation metrics to prove their overall effectiveness.

Method: Image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction starting with images and constructing paired text and guidance responses, plus fine-tuning a safety judge model for standardized evaluation.

Result: Generated an RMS dataset of 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the image-oriented approach across various tasks.

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach offers a new perspective for constructing real-world multimodal safety datasets, confirming its scalability and effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

*Zanwei Zhou,Taoran Yi,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Lingxi Xie,Xinggang Wang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDT-dist is a novel framework for few-step 3D flow distillation that reduces sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 while preserving quality, achieving 6.5-9x speedup on A800.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based 3D generation models require dozens of sampling steps during inference, and few-step distillation methods remain under-explored for complex 3D generation tasks despite advancements in 2D diffusion acceleration.

Method: Proposes MDT-dist framework with two optimizable objectives: Velocity Matching (VM) to match velocity fields between student and teacher models, and Velocity Distillation (VD) that enhances optimization by leveraging learned velocity fields for probability density distillation.

Result: Reduces sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 per flow transformer, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800 while maintaining high visual and geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: The method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation approaches and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation, demonstrating effective acceleration of complex 3D flow models.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

*Hyunsoo Cha,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Durian is the first zero-shot method for portrait animation with facial attribute transfer using dual reference networks in a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent facial attribute transfer from reference images to target portraits in animation videos without explicit supervision.

Method: Uses dual reference networks to inject spatial features from both portrait and attribute images into diffusion denoising. Trained with self-reconstruction using frames from same video, mask expansion strategy, and spatial/appearance transformations for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer and enables multi-attribute composition in single generation without additional training.

Conclusion: Durian effectively generalizes across diverse attributes and real-world reference combinations through its dual reference design and robust training strategies.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

*Benjamin El-Zein,Dominik Eckert,Andreas Fieselmann,Christopher Syben,Ludwig Ritschl,Steffen Kappler,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation method using differentiable Hough transform to detect collimator shadows in X-ray images, achieving robust reconstruction with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collimation in X-ray imaging reduces radiation exposure but detecting collimator shadows is challenging when edges are obscured by scattered radiation. Prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal shadows enables geometry-constrained approaches.

Method: Combines deep learning segmentation with differentiable Hough transform network to detect collimation borders and extract ROI center information. Uses line-constrained segmentation masks during inference by combining information from both tasks.

Result: Achieves robust reconstruction of collimated regions with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real X-ray images. Method is not limited to specific number of edges.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages geometric constraints through Hough transform to improve collimation detection in X-ray imaging, providing accurate and robust results for radiation dose optimization.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCF-UM introduces a cyclic evaluation framework to measure semantic drift in unified visual language models when alternating between image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, revealing significant variations in cross-modal consistency that single-pass metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for unified visual language models only assess image-to-text and text-to-image capabilities in isolation, failing to measure whether models maintain semantic consistency when cycling between modalities.

Method: Developed UCF-UM framework with three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (embedding-based semantic loss), Semantic Drift Rate (decay rate), and Multi-Generation GenEval (object-level compliance). Created ND400 benchmark from NoCaps and DOCCI datasets to evaluate 7 recent models.

Result: Significant variation in cross-modal stability found - some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over multiple alternations, while others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency evaluation is essential as a complement to standard metrics, providing practical measures to assess unified models' cross-modal stability and shared representation strength.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

TL;DR: Survey paper on panoramic vision techniques focusing on perspective-to-panorama domain adaptation challenges and solutions across 20+ tasks from 300+ research papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception in applications like VR, autonomous driving, and robotics, coupled with the unique challenges of omnidirectional images that differ significantly from perspective images.

Method: Systematic review of panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods, analysis of three key domain adaptation challenges (geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, boundary continuity), cross-method and cross-task analysis of 20+ representative tasks.

Result: Comprehensive classification of panoramic vision into four categories: visual quality enhancement/assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation, with analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic-specific challenges.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications to drive panoramic vision research advancement, providing forward-looking perspectives for developing panoramic vision technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of

TL;DR: Plot'n Polish is a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story visualization with fine-grained control over image generation and editing at various detail levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models lack flexibility for applying fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing seamless crafting and refinement of visual stories.

Method: A zero-shot framework called Plot'n Polish that provides enhanced control, refinement, and post-generation modification capabilities for story visualization.

Result: The framework enables consistent story generation with fine-grained control over visualizations at various levels of detail.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish addresses the important challenge of providing enhanced control and consistency in story visualization using diffusion models, making it suitable for real-world creative applications.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

*Jun-Kun Chen,Aayush Bansal,Minh Phuoc Vo,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFR is a novel video generative model for creating arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos using segment-by-segment generation with prefix video conditions and anchor videos to ensure smoothness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generation of long virtual try-on videos without requiring resource-intensive generation processes or lengthy video data, while maintaining flexibility for arbitrary video lengths.

Method: Auto-regressive segment-by-segment generation process using prefix video conditions for local smoothness between adjacent segments and anchor videos (360-degree wholebody capture) for global temporal consistency across segments.

Result: Successfully generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions.

Conclusion: VFR represents a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation, demonstrating effective solutions for maintaining video quality and consistency in extended sequences.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.
