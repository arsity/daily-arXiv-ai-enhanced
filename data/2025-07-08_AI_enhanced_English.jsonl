To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

To solve these issues, this paper proposes\nRegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models\n(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of\nCRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional\ncross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear\ncomplexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under\ntexture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)\nstrategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through\nmultiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically\nfuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature\nrepresentations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be\nseamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting\nregistration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a\nmulti-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local\ninformation and enable effective interaction between global and local features.\nExtensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated\nthat RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes RegistrationMamba, a Mamba-based architecture for cross-modal remote sensing image registration, addressing challenges like nonlinear radiometric variations and limited textures.

Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps\nin unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying\nmodels. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising\ndata while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time\nand memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the\ntransformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original\ndata. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and\nglobal shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in\nterms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the\nobjective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering\nguided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to\nserve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the\noriginal data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that\nmeasure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,\nrespectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of\ndatasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.\nResults reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal.
