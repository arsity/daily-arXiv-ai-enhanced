Project page: https://driveqaiccv.github.io/", "summary": "If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,\nwould it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks\non current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a\ncomplete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way\nprinciples. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases\nthat rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an\nextensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers\ntraffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we\nshow that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on\nbasic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning\nand complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial\nlayouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple\ncategories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection\ndecision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into\nmodel sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,\ndistance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances\ndownstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world\ndatasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can\ninternalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively\nacross downstream QA tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveQA is a comprehensive benchmark for testing LLMs and MLLMs on driving knowledge, covering traffic rules, signage, and complex scenarios.

Fine-tuning on comprehensive driving knowledge data significantly improves model performance and generalization capabilities for real-world autonomous driving applications."}}
